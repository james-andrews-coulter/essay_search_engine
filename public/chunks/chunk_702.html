        <h3>¶ Water Towers</h3>
<p>Our culture gives us ideas about what kinds of things might be worth admiring; it sends out hints about what is potentially fascinating, exciting, impressive or beautiful. But, in general, our current culture has had quite a restricted agenda. It has been very good at getting us to see the charms of dolphins, mountains, little villages in rural France, beaches with palm trees, brilliantly engineered bridges and Art Deco hotels from the 1920s. These are all worthy objects of delight, but they are rare, which is a problem: the things we encounter every day can feel dreary and disappointing by comparison.</p>
<p>Bernd and Hilla Becher, Water Towers, 1972–2009.</p>
<p>The Bechers’ sympathetic eye transformed water towers from unloved industrial eyesores to objects worthy of admiration; art can do this for many under-appreciated subjects in the world.</p>
<p>In 1972, a German couple, Bernd and Hilla Becher, set out to change these assumptions. They started to photograph water towers across Germany and the US. These industrial structures were then among the least admired of all buildings; they were deemed hulking and brutish and people would become predictably furious if ever one was planned near where they lived</p>
<p>Yet the Bechers’ photographs – arranged in serene and elegant frames, and hung in sequences along gallery walls – showed for the first time just how beautiful these towers actually were. One could appreciate the patterns of rust and their rugged authenticity; their legs had a certain dignity and playfulness.</p>
<p>The real point of the Bechers’ exercise, however, wasn’t specifically about water storage facilities. The towers provided an example for a much wider point: that there is a great deal more that is lovely and interesting in the world than we expect. To gain access to this, we may need some prompts and guidance. In other words, we may need art.</p>
