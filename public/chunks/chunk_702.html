        <h3>A questionnaire to develop the five skills of love</h3>
<p>(i) Nondefensiveness</p>
<p>•   What criticisms have stung you in the past?</p>
<p>•   Might there have been any truth in them, even if they were meanly expressed?</p>
<p>•   How did you respond? How, ideally, might you have responded?</p>
<p>•   Ask a trusted and kind friend to say one critical thing about you; note your emotions (the possible spasms of hurt, outrage or fear). Dare to ask for further information – and to trust that your friend does not suddenly, mysteriously, ‘hate’ you.</p>
<p>•   Are you in theory able to imagine being loved and criticised at the same time?</p>
<p>(ii) Vulnerability</p>
<p>•   What might you be embarrassed to admit to a partner (around money, sex, politics, career mishaps, personal habits, tastes, regrets)? Be as frank as possible, in the deep privacy of your mind. Then, with care and courage, choose a friend to make an initial confession to. And then another.</p>
<p>•   One day, tell someone that you miss them terribly.</p>
<p>•   Note what is most ‘babyish’ in you and reframe your longings and fragilities in a less shame-filled direction.</p>
<p>•   In what ways might everyone be, for better and for worse, childish?</p>
<p>(iii) Tenderness</p>
<p>•   Think of something a person might do that would seriously offend you (they tell a blatant lie, they freeload, they do something sexually unusual). What would be the kindest explanation for their conduct?</p>
<p>•   When have you done something that might offend a virtuous onlooker? Try to account for, and then look imaginatively upon, your own behaviour.</p>
<p>•   Employ similar generosity towards another person who has failed or done something you disapprove of.</p>
<p>•   Reflect on what twists of fate might, in a slightly different version of your life, have meant that you did something you abhor.</p>
<p>•   Read the newspaper and pick out two ‘villains’ who have done unfortunate things. Try to imagine them as new- borns. How would you consider their fate with tenderness?</p>
<p>(iv) A therapeutic attitude</p>
<p>•   What was emotionally tricky in your own childhood – even if everyone meant substantially well?</p>
<p>•   What ‘scars’ has the past left on your adult personality?</p>
<p>•   What about you is unbalanced or extreme?</p>
<p>•   How have your assumptions about other people ‘in general’ been unfairly coloured by experiences with specific people in your early years?</p>
<p>•   What are the main ways in which you defend yourself against unbearable truths about who you are?</p>
<p>(v) Enthusiasm</p>
<p>•   Reflect on a friendship that has, over the years, gone cold. Analyse what ‘small’ hurts might lie beneath your corroded affection. Dare to tell a friend about what in their behaviour upset you.</p>
<p>•   How good are you at pointing out irritations and wounds to others? How well can you clear the air so that the channels of admiration are unblocked?</p>
<p>•   Imagine gently explaining to someone that they have – inadvertently – made you feel sad or angry. How does this make you feel?</p>
<hr />
<p>These are painfully complicated questions and prompts. They probe at things we rarely recognise or acknowledge in ourselves. We may need to revisit these exercises at intervals to settle and refine our answers. But they are showing us two big things. Firstly, that we might not automatically be ready to make a relationship succeed. Secondly, that the qualities that help relationships work are open to education and development. We can (like someone taking driving lessons) improve on what we need to know. Nurturing love is the business of a lifetime; the idea that we may not be entirely ready for the task ahead is not an insult. It’s a sane and hopeful recognition of the scale and importance of the enterprise upon which we seek to embark.</p>
