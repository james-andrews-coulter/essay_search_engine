            <h2>9.  Relationships</h2>
<p>‘Work and love’ was Freud’s formulation for what was important in life, the central aspects of experience from which we derive meaning and pleasure. We don’t much talk about love nowadays, but relationships continue to be of primary significance to all of us. At the same time, no area of experience has been affected more dramatically by digital technology than relationships in all their guises – from friendship to sociability to collegiality and, indeed, intimacy and love.</p>
<p>On the one hand, digital technologies widen the reach of our acquaintance and our access to others incrementally; most of us ‘know’ hundreds more people than we ever did before, and across a larger geographic territory. But what is meant by ‘knowing’ others has changed enormously. We ‘talk’ with each other voicelessly, via texting or Facebook; and we communicate with each other en masse, in Twitter-sized sound bites. Even sexual relations – formerly a privileged realm of deep privacy and complex passions – are increasingly conducted via dating apps such as Tinder, on the basis of snapshot information and with no necessary assumption of emotional involvement.</p>
<p>Perhaps, occasionally, such virtually arranged encounters can result in a coup de foudre – an instant attraction that turns into intimacy and leads to a long-term relationship. But mostly they don’t, and like other forms of hedonic behaviour, they all too often lead not to pleasure or mutual knowledge but to a stale sense of disappointment and deprivation.</p>
<p>Authentic human contact is the basic foodstuff of the psyche; in its absence, we become internally arid and diminished. There is a danger, however, that in our increasing reliance on digital communications we may be losing track of what such contact is, or how we can achieve it. In an important book, Reclaiming Conversation, Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist who has written intensively about the effects of digital technologies on our inner lives, worries that in losing our habit of face-to-face conversation we are also losing the all-important capacity for empathy – for understanding other people’s minds and feelings. In studies of today’s elementary school pupils, it appears that in marked contrast to previous generations, such children prefer their iPads and mobile phones to talking or playing with others; and that therefore their capacity for empathy, which usually develops quite naturally – the ability to recognize what other children feel, and act accordingly – is severely reduced. Digital children can be unwittingly mean to their schoolmates without realizing they are being hurtful, or reading the signs of other children’s distress. Moreover, in our adult lives, we also increasingly prefer digital messaging to face-to-face contact. Our pleasure centres light up when our mobile phones signal a message, and we routinely allow virtual communications to interrupt our in vivo exchanges. The curtailment of basic human skills early on, and the loss of human contact in our adult lives, has worrying implications for all of our social and personal relationships – for the development of generosity and compassion, and for our ability to judge others’ motives accurately.</p>
<p>Plato Conversing with his Pupils – dialogue is foundational to philosophy, and to humane understanding.</p>
<p>Conversation – of the embodied, face-to-face kind – is of course the basic currency of human exchange, and is a way not only of knowing others, but of understanding ourselves. Indeed, we could hardly become ourselves, or know anything much, in isolation. Our identities initially develop through our early relationships with others, and our later understanding expands through various kinds of dialogue: with books, with teachers, peers and friends. Socrates conducted his philosophical teachings through dialogue; and dialogue is at the heart of depth-therapy and psychoanalysis (which in its first days was, after all, called ‘the talking cure’).</p>
<p>It’s good to talk, and in some cultures and periods conversation was considered a high art, with settings dedicated to its cultivation. The French salon – that supposedly dandyish and frivolous institution – often had a serious purpose: to bring together like-minded people in order to discuss issues of the day outside the hierarchy and the ritualized forms of the royal court. In all registers – from sociability to collegiality, from teaching to political debate and informal discussion – conversation is a way of thinking with others; of testing our own and others’ ideas, in a free and playful flow of shared thought.</p>
<p>But this happy combination of spontaneity and absorption requires, above all, unscripted time. In a piece called ‘The Myth of Quality Time’, Frank Bruni, a New York Times columnist, describes a family ritual in which twenty members of an extended family gather at a beach house for a ‘solid week’ – an amount of time which his friends find shockingly long, but which most people even a few decades ago would have found positively mingy. Bruni contrasts this form of being together with the notion of ‘quality time’, in which we dutifully set aside a pre-planned hour or two for what is, in effect, another task – girding yourself to pay close attention to another person. Bruni’s unscripted week, in contrast, allows for the unexpected observation and the spontaneous encounter to emerge. ‘With a more expansive stretch,’ he writes,</p>
<p>there’s a better chance that I’ll be around for the precise, random moment when one of my nephews drops his guard and solicits my advice about something private … Or when one of my siblings will flash back on an incident from our childhood that makes us laugh uncontrollably … There’s simply no real substitute for physical presence.</p>
<p>This should be obvious, but is becoming less so. In a way, we need to relearn what, for most people throughout much of history, came rather naturally: the habit of being with others, and learning about them through physical proximity as well as conversation and disclosure. Attraction can be instant, but forming a bond with another person – whether it is in friendship or intimacy – requires a particular kind of attentiveness, and the kind of time in which we can follow the train of another person’s thought, or absorb their mood or expressive gaze without driving to a conclusion or thinking impatiently about our next appointment. The French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas thought that the source of all meaning and significance resided in the individual human face. In coming to know another person, we need to learn how to ‘read’ their expressive language as well as their verbal utterances.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ability to be with others and to understand them is not very different from the ability to be with ourselves, and to know ourselves from within. We can only recognize emotions and responses in other people if we have experienced and understood them ourselves. In order to enter another person’s inner landscape, we need to have travelled our own, and to have opened various areas of thought and feeling. If these are closed off within ourselves, then we do not have the instruments of perception with which to understand another person.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we need to abolish all distance, or separateness, between ourselves and others, or to merge with them to the detriment of losing our own agency or identity. In a way, the need for boundaries also mimics our relationship to ourselves, and the need for some detachment from our own impulses or emotions. The process of arriving at self-knowledge involves some separation from our unexamined impulses, or aspects of ourselves which we do not value. And, if our relationship to another person is to be one of equals, we also need the combination of empathy and boundaries. Empathy is not the same thing as automatic sympathy; if we find ourselves in conflict with a close friend or intimate, it is a better part of respect to say what we really think, rather than pretend anodyne agreement. If a partner engages in some small act of dishonesty or betrayal, a failure to express our disappointment or even anger may only suggest indifference or a lack of trust. For that matter, if a person we care about is struggling with some internal problem – say, they feel perennially underestimated by their colleagues – it is not sufficient to say ‘There, there, of course you’re right – you are great and they are fools.’ That might be as unhelpful as it is unrealistic. Again, it is a better part of mutual respect to examine with the other person where the problem may actually lie – just as we might want to examine such a difficulty within ourselves. For this, we might want to delve more deeply into the causes of the problem with them, and find out together whether, for example, they are afraid to do their best for fear of failure; or whether they might be overestimating themselves, and therefore taking offence at others’ appraisal of them.</p>
<p>That level of honesty calls for a great deal of trust. It requires us to apply the same standards of concern, love and realistic judgement to our friends and intimates as we apply to ourselves. Doing unto others as we would have them do unto us, if it is understood deeply enough, turns out to be a demanding motto and imperative. It requires not only a principled respect (necessary though that is to our social relations) but, at the intimate level, a recognition of another person as a full human being with emotions and a mind like our own.</p>
<p>Of course, giving extended time to any one person is complicated by the same problems of proliferating choice that riddle our decisions in other areas of life. Dating sites increase the sense that there is countless plenitude of available partners. Why stop our search, or decide prematurely that one (always imperfect) potential partner will do? In a way, this is a version of a syndrome that has become prevalent enough to acquire an acronym: FOMO, or fear of missing out. Just what are we missing out on? What exciting things could we be doing, what fantastic people could we be meeting, at any one moment – or at least, on any one extended evening? FOMO used to be a phenomenon limited mostly to adolescents who dreaded not being invited to the right parties, but it now extends itself at least to young adults, and often further.</p>
<p>Intimacy begins with entering the language of another person’s face.</p>
<p>The seemingly endless availability of potential partners, combined with the almost complete lack of restrictions on sexual behaviour, mitigate against commitment; but as a gathering body of studies and personal testimony shows, this does not lead to greater satisfaction – any more than hedonic dispersion and impulsiveness lead to well-being in other areas of experience. In this all-important dimension of our lives, we also need to make our choices not in response to external stimuli, but from within. We may no longer believe in the romantic idea of ‘one and only’ object of love, but close relationships conducted with trust and candour remain the most fulfilling form of engagement and the most authentic source of meaning we know. Coming to truly know another person – whether it is a romantic partner or a friend – calls for all our powers of thought and the full palette of emotional perception. At the same time, such relationships allow us to express our individuality – our particular preferences, foibles and quirks – more completely than we can in any other area of experience; and therefore to be known and appreciated in three dimensions.</p>
<p>In contrast to virtual knowledge, which takes place in the flat spaces of computer screens and via abbreviated communications, intimacy proceeds from inter-subjectivity – an interplay of subjectivities which calls for authenticity of response, and a kind of reciprocal depth perception. In bringing all of ourselves into play, and in being perceived three-dimensionally, we come to experience our personalities and inner lives more vividly and richly – to exercise our full human intelligence. Our subjective selves need to be touched, as our bodies do. If we ever feel guilty or restless about giving open-ended time to an intimate or a friend, we need to remember that being with others – knowing others and being known in depth – is essential to our happiness, as well as to living a fully humane life.</p>
