            <h3>Secondly: We cannot predict the future</h3>
<p>It’s a seldom-mentioned detail that to kill oneself requires a great deal of certainty. It may not seem as though the taking of one’s own life would call for intellectual self-confidence or faith in one’s powers of forecasting, but it implicitly does. As we prepare the tool to end ourselves forever, it is necessary that we be filled with the conviction that we will always hate ourselves, that nothing about our circumstances can ever change and that the world will never shift in any way towards something more manageable and easier to bear. To kill oneself is to claim to know the future.</p>
<p>However, we should have enough experience of our minds to realise that they have not been endowed with any such infinite power. We can’t even foresee how things will turn out over a day – for ourselves or for the world – let alone over three or four decades. There are so many moments in all of our lives when, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon, we feel revolted by ourselves and our chances, only for our spirits to shift and, by 8 p.m., to have turned the corner. We are creatures who don’t notice how volatile and temperamental we are. Our moods have a terrible habit of not identifying themselves as such; they claim to represent settled, robust positions when in fact they are merely clusters of temporary associations floating on a complex stream of chemicals.</p>
<p>The tragedy of suicide is that the act allows us one, and only one, mood to determine our entire future. It is therefore profoundly unfair to the many alternative or latent versions of who we are – the sweet self, the curious self, the loving self; unfair to all our selves to be murdered by the present, despairing incarnation of us that is right now dominating the control room of our minds.</p>
<p>As well as our changeable moods and emotions, we should be equally sceptical about the fixity of the world. Certain unpredictable swerves of fate may have brought us to thoughts of suicide: the swerve that created the revolution, the sexual panic, the economic crash, the request for a divorce … Something major that we hadn’t ever thought possible might tip our lives into horror; a dreadful rare event that strips everything of meaning. But in our shock, we cease to notice an element of hope. If fate has swerved into disaster, it might well – with equal unpredictability and suddenness – swerve back into something more bearable. We might not be able to see how the revolution could ever end, how the moral panic might be wound back, how the economy could pick up or how a new lover might enter our lives – but our inability to see a line between our current situation and a bearable future doesn’t mean that there won’t eventually be one. We could be surprised by hope just as much as we have been surprised by horror.</p>
<p>There is something hubristic and poignant about a claim to know how we will feel and what the world will be like over an extended period that we are in fact stripping ourselves of our ability to witness. Christians once determined that the problem of suicide lay in what they termed ‘despair’: a loss of hope in the possibility of an intervention from God. But we don’t have to rely on miracles in order to hold on to the idea that the circumstances which brought us to our present anguish might over time cede to more benevolent forces. Hopeful things are as likely to happen as unhopeful ones: history might alter, new inventions and ideas could solve old forms of suffering and love might arrive without warning.</p>
<p>We don’t control existence; we should surely have learnt this by now. We can’t tell what might unfold. Though we may have experienced the negative side of fate, we shouldn’t deny ourselves the chance to live through its possible positives. We don’t have to know quite what good thing might happen (we’re almost certainly too tired and too sad to do that anyway); only that it might do so.</p>
