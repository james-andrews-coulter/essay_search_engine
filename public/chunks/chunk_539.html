        <h3>7. Culture</h3>
<p>People who want to express admiration for culture often say it is valuable ‘for its own sake’. We propose that it is valuable because of its capacity to address our needs for education, guidance, consolation, perspective, encouragement and correction.</p>
<p>The School of Life is drawn to the idea that culture is therapeutic. This doesn’t mean it should primarily help us with very urgent mental health issues. However, it can assist us with managing the normal troubles of everyday life: the tendency to become irritated with people we like; to lose perspective over minor matters; to abandon sympathy for people who deserve our compassion; and to take too harsh a view of our own mistakes.</p>
<p>The School of Life believes that the world has, up to now, not properly made use of the true therapeutic potential of culture, paying it reverence without learning how to make use of it systematically.</p>
