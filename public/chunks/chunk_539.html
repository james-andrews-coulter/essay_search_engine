        <h3>¶ Popularisation</h3>
<p>Popularisation has acquired a very bad reputation in certain quarters. To describe someone as a ‘good populariser’ is to crush them with faint praise. A Romantic prejudice suggests that the mark of true genius is to be of deep interest only to a very few.</p>
<p>Yet the destiny of every properly good idea is to be popular, so the task of good thinking must include not just the formulation of good ideas, but also their powerful and seductive dissemination through society.</p>
<p>The noble populariser realises that sounding dense, hard to understand and elusive is almost always a sign of not having thought hard enough rather than of being a genius. The goal of the populariser is that their ideas should, after a time, start to sound like common sense. The populariser assumes it to be a more complex undertaking to make something sound obvious than to insist on its strangeness. They are more interested in the good of their audience than in their own reputations.</p>
<p>For democracies to succeed, they cannot afford to let good ideas be merely the preserve of the few. They need to democratise not just soap powder and airline travel, but widespread and constant access to the best thoughts and positions – so that tyranny and error can be kept at bay. Collective wisdom depends on the art of popularisation.</p>
