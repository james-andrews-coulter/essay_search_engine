        <h4>4. How to Collect a Home</h4>
<p>Since when did owning things make you happy? The burdens of possession.</p>
<p>Living out of a suitcase</p>
<p>I’m not a child or a teenager any more. I ceased to be one when I moved away from my bedroom in my parents’ house. I packed my things up and went on my way; and soon
  enough, home ceased to be the place I had come from, and became the stuff I was carrying with me.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much. In those days, I could fit my things into a few bags: a suitcase of clothes, a box of books, a hi-fi, posters rolled up into a tube. That was more than twenty years ago.
  I couldn’t do it now. In the meantime, I’ve just collected too much stuff. Some of what I have collected over the years has been furniture, but furniture isn’t the only thing with
  which we fill our homes. It’s the other stuff that I’ve accumulated – and I suspect you have too – that makes up the majority of the things we have to carry around.</p>
<p>Every year or so, I try to throw some of it away. Some objects whose utility is obvious, or obviously expired, are easy to get rid of; but the rest is much more difficult, and I end up hanging
  on to all sorts of things for no reason that I can clearly explain. I’m not talking about clothes, or kitchen utensils, or other things with easily ascribed functions. I’m talking about
  the things that accumulate in attics, in the second drawer down in the kitchen, on the walls of teenage bedrooms, on mantelpieces, in bookshelves and at the bottoms of handbags.</p>
<p>To call this stuff bric-a-brac or junk or clutter is to devalue it. To think of it as ornament is perhaps useful: extraneous, additional, unnecessary, sometimes pretty, but not always. Sometimes
  there’s a signet ring lurking in there, an antique statuette, a Sevres vase, or a first edition. But all too often, its value is difficult to articulate. What it means, precisely, is not
  always clear.</p>
<p>Buildings and furniture and décor can be designed; but this stuff generally isn’t. That is not to say that individual pieces haven’t been designed by anyone; but en masse, as
  a collection, they are, apparently, incoherent. I have no real idea as to how I have collected most of my possessions, or why.</p>
<p>Take books, for example. What is the point of lining the walls of rooms with books one has either already read (and will never read again) or that one will never read? Why, when their function
  has expired, do we still hang on to them? Why, in the age of the Kindle and the tablet, do we collect them in the first place?</p>
<p>And it’s not just books. I have slides I shall never look at again; cassette tapes I made as a teenager that I can no longer listen to and letters no biographer will ever read. I have, in
  boxes I never open, collections of tropical seashells, 78-rpm records and Beatrix Potter figurines I collected as a child. Lurking at the bottom of drawers there are pulled wisdom teeth and broken
  cufflinks, balls of BluTack covered in fluff, and money kept from countries I shall never visit again.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of this book, we started with the idea that home is a fixed point of origin. We concluded the second by considering home as a nomadic affair. In the third we thought about
  home as ephemeral scenery. I’ve spent the first half of this book extolling the idea of home as light, temporary, mobile and changeable. But if I actually go and take a look at my own home, I
  realize I haven’t taken my own advice: I’m so weighed down by my possessions that I might as well stay where I am.</p>
<p>Ornaments are crime</p>
<p>There’s something wicked about collecting. Le Corbusier decried the overcrowded homes of his own era as ‘furniture stores’, and exhorted his readers to
  ‘bear in mind economy in your actions, your household management, and in your thoughts’.1 ‘Ornament is Crime’ wrote Adolf Loos;
  and ornaments, argued Frank Lloyd Wright, were the ‘bête noire of the new simplicity’. ‘If you want a golden rule that will fit everything, this is it,’ wrote William
  Morris. ‘Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.’</p>
<p>And collectors themselves have always been seen as morally dubious, too. Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane surrounds himself with an endless collection of trophies, from art to
  buildings, priceless jewels to a beautiful wife; but the lesson of his story is that possessing none of them could make him happy; and his last word, ‘Rosebud’, refers to a simple toy
  of his childhood rather than any of the precious wonders he ever amassed in his extraordinary career.</p>
<p>John Pierpont Morgan, like William Randolph Hearst, and many of the American robber barons on whom Kane was based, spent millions on an encyclopaedic and indiscriminate collection of European
  art. He had so much that he had no idea what he possessed. Once, on enquiring where his Michelangelo was kept, his secretary reminded him: ‘this bronze bust is in your library, and faces you
  when sitting in your chair. It has been there about a year.’2</p>
<p>But the history of collecting reaches its climax with the mysterious and complex character of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Rudolf II, who reigned between 1576 and 1612. Even at the
  time, everyone thought he was odd. The Venetian ambassador noted that he never smiled, or laughed, and remarked upon his manners as ‘spaniolated’ – that is, as haughty and
  withdrawn as a Spaniard.</p>
<p>Most of the stories about the Emperor concerned his greed. His niece, the Archduchess of Styria, wrote: ‘What he knows, he feels obliged to have.’3 Everyone knew that the only way to engage the Emperor was to bring him gifts that were, in the words of the archduchess, ‘both extraordinary and
  miraculous’.4</p>
<p>Rudolph kept everything, and in a catalogue that was made of his collection in 1607, there were listed 101 cabinets that contained antique medals and paintings, mandrakes and the skeleton of a
  basilisk, clocks and astrolabes, gems and a stuffed dodo, the horn of a unicorn, and a bowl Rudolf believed to be the Holy Grail. There were lumps of real gold and fool’s gold, and bestiaries
  filled with images of animals that never existed. He kept it all under lock and key in his Wunderkammer: his cabinet of curiosity.</p>
<p>All sorts of rumours circulated about the Emperor, but perhaps the strangest was one that was used to explain his unprecedented avarice. The reason he had amassed so many possessions, people
  said, was because he hoped that among them he would find the philosopher’s stone, with which his court alchemists could turn any substance into gold. He would lock himself into his
  Wunderkammer for days at a time, they would say, and sit there searching his eclectic possessions for the elusive stone.</p>
<p>He never found it, of course. Instead, he spent his life shut up in his cabinet, isolated from the people, the politics, and the empire he was meant to be leading; with catastrophic results for
  himself (he was deposed), for his collection (which was dispersed), and for his empire, which dissolved into thirty years of war after his death. If there was ever a cautionary tale about
  collecting, then the story of Rudolf II’s Wunderkammer provides it.</p>
<p>I suspect that very few of us can claim to possess a unicorn’s horn or the holy grail; but if we counted the things we have stored up in our homes, we might find that they numbered well
  into the thousands – as many as Rudolf II collected. Living in a modern world filled with countless objects, we are all guilty of the avarice of emperors.</p>
<p>We’ve never really approved of clutter, and we still don’t. TV shows like Get Your House in Order, Hoarding: Buried Alive, or Mission Organization show us
  how to get rid of the stuff, and persuade us that the desire to collect is driven by unresolved psychological trauma. Grief for the loss of loved ones, for example, manifests itself in an inability
  to throw away the things they have left behind. A desire to shop masks an inner emptiness.</p>
<p>Each time, the process of throwing things away liberates participants from problems that have, quite literally, been weighing them down for years. Griefs are resolved, fears faced, and burdens
  lifted, as the objects are carried out of the house and taken to the charity shop or the skip. Imagine it happening to Rudolf II: could the Thirty Years War have been avoided if he’d gone on
  Get Your House in Order? What problems could you solve if you were able to throw everything away?</p>
<p>The strange comfort of things: a Renaissance cabinet of curiosities.</p>
<p>The comfort of things</p>
<p>Our possessions, and our inability to stop ourselves acquiring more of them, still present us with a problem. In 2008, the anthropologist Danny Miller wrote that we live in
  ‘what sometimes seems like a deluge of goods and shopping. We tend to assume that this has two results: that we are more superficial, and that we are more materialistic, that our
  relationships to things comes at the expense of our relationships to people.’5</p>
<p>It was a hypothesis that Miller decided to test by interviewing as many of the inhabitants of a certain Stuart Street in London as would speak to him. While the street itself might have been
  made up of a uniform terrace of houses, he found within them as diverse a range of homes and of people as a global city at the turn of the twenty-first century could provide.</p>
<p>Miller found collections of CDs obsessively arranged in alphabetical order, hoards of photographs, boxes of Christmas decorations, collections of toys from McDonald’s Happy Meals,
  greetings cards, and a population of hundreds of plastic ducks. Every house he found was a Wunderkammer of sorts – an obsessive collection of things neither obviously useful nor
  beautiful, collected seemingly at random.</p>
<p>Miller composed his study into a series of vignettes of the lives lived behind the closed doors of Stuart Street; and he chose to start with an account of a house belonging to a man who had no
  clutter at all. Perhaps such a person might, being unfettered by possessions, be free of the superficialities of modern life, and free to form relationships with people rather than things.</p>
<p>But Miller soon discovered that his initial hypothesis was mistaken. Aside from a carpet and some furniture, George’s flat was completely empty. There were no plants, no posters, no
  postcards: nothing at all. ‘There is a violence to such emptiness,’ he reflected:</p>
<p>Faced with nothing, one’s gaze is not returned, attention is not circumscribed. There is a loss of shape, discernment and integrity. There is no sense of the person as
      the other, who defines one’s own boundary and extent. I was trying to concentrate on what he was saying, but I was disturbed by the sheer completeness of the void.6</p>
<p>As the interview continued, the absence of objects in George’s home, Miller found, mirrored the absence of agency in his life. The reason his home was empty, free of
  clutter and junk, wasn’t some higher state of aesthetic consciousness or spiritual freedom from desire.</p>
<p>George had had no career to speak of, no friends, no interests, and, after his parents had died, only one very distant relative whom he rarely saw. Miller left in tears: ‘One simply
  couldn’t escape the conclusion,’ he recollected, ‘that this was a man, more or less waiting for his time on earth to be over, but who at the age of seventy-six had never yet seen
  his life actually begin.’7</p>
<p>As he worked his way up and down Stuart Street, Miller found time and time again that the things people had collected, and the ways in which they had acquired them, seemed to mirror the ways in
  which they related to people, too.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Clarke filled their homes with gifts for and from extensive networks of friends and family. Marina collected toys from McDonald’s Happy Meals, Mrs Stone greetings cards, and
  Jacques beer glasses filched from pubs.</p>
<p>In each case, Miller listened as his subjects spoke about their possessions: not just to what they were saying but how they were saying it. Elia was a magical storyteller, he recalled:
  ‘Her hands dance the tale she tells and through some sleight of hand a ghost suddenly appears and dominates the room for a while, before fading back into some furniture or piece of clothing
  that has its home in her world.’8</p>
<p>As he listened to her, Miller realized that, for Elia, possessions were haunted by the people who had made them or given them to her. She used the stool in the corner, for example, which had
  been made by her grandfather, to refer to him as if it were his presence in the room; and she encouraged her own grandchildren to play with it just as they might have played with him.9</p>
<p>And as he listened to the inhabitants of Stuart Street, Miller also looked around him, not just at the things that they had collected, but also at the ways in which they had arranged them.</p>
<p>For example, Mary and Hugh’s copious collections of snaps, framed certificates and other documents were hung on the walls of their sitting room in groups. One section of wall related to
  their origins in Ireland, others to their life as landlords of various pubs around London, others again to their Catholic faith. Sitting in their sitting room, they could, from the comfort of their
  armchairs, remember where they had come from, survey their busy and sociable lives, and contemplate their religion.</p>
<p>But Miller noticed that the ways in which some people arranged their clutter seemed to contain more subtle messages. Marjorie, he observed, didn’t just own a diverse array of objects, both
  precious and worthless, but displayed them together in all sorts of ironic couplings: serious newspaper clippings were pinned to the notice board along with silly photographs; real flowers shared
  vases with fake ones, and ‘a white ceramic Chinese figure of Serenity’ was displayed along with a farting fish.10</p>
<p>Marjorie’s unexpected juxtapositions, in which one serious object was always undermined by another ridiculous one, reflected, Miller argued, her own pragmatic, humorous approach to a long
  life spent as a foster mother to over forty children. By the end of the study, Miller was able to conclude that collecting was not just the sign of empty avarice. ‘The closer our
  relationships are with objects,’ he wrote, ‘the closer our relationships are with people.’11</p>
<p>He entitled his book The Comfort of Things. It might seem that the similarities Miller was spotting between human and object relationships were the inevitable, inadvertent results of
  the way that people made their homes. But he himself was persuaded that everyone seemed to have a personal aesthetic that governed the ways in which they related to both objects and people. This
  was not taste as such, but a pattern of repeated behaviours and arrangements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is something that Miller came to believe was entirely deliberate:</p>
<p>Some things may be gifts or objects retained from the past, but they have decided to live with them, to place them in lines, or higgledy piggledy; they made the room
      minimalist or crammed to the gills. These things are not a random collection. They have been gradually accumulated as an expression of that person or household.12</p>
<p>These arrangements of things – higgledy-piggledy or in lines, en masse like the plastic ducks, or placed in contradictory collage like Marjorie’s Chinese Serenity
  figure and her farting fish – were things that, he argued, had been carefully constructed over time.</p>
<p>And like the work of any artist, the ways in which people arrange things, wrote Miller, ‘form the basis on which people judge the world and themselves’.13 It’s a sentence that has an echo of Bachelard’s idea of home as a ‘real cosmos’.14 He was referring to
  the house as a building; but he could equally have been talking about the bric-a-brac it contained.</p>
<p>The alchemy of collecting</p>
<p>It has always been that way. If the rumours are to be believed, the Emperor Rudolf was convinced that somewhere in his collection he would find, one day, the philosopher’s
  stone.</p>
<p>He was wrong: the philosopher’s stone was not in his collection. Rather, it was his collection. The wonders and the instruments it contained were collected to record and
  to measure the heavens and the earth, and the court scholars who worked in it, like the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, used them to revolutionize our understanding of the world,
  leading to the work of Galileo, Newton and the discovery of gravity itself.</p>
<p>Likewise, the artworks and the curiosities he owned now form the core of the collections of several major national museums; and their creation transformed the careers and reputations of artists
  as diverse as Arcimboldo, famous for his portraits of the Emperor made of fruit, fish, and flowers, the watercolourist Joris Hoefnagel, and the jewellers Jan Vermeyen and Ottavio Miseroni.</p>
<p>Rudolph’s cabinet of curiosities was the germ of the modern museum, the lab, the studio, and the archive; but like many of its contemporaries, it was not organized, catalogued, or
  classified according to any scientific system we would recognize. That is why we still call such places Wunderkammer, ‘wonder-chambers’: they are cabinets of curiosity provoked
  rather than curiosity satisfied.</p>
<p>The curiosities in his uncle Ferdinand’s cabinet in the castle of Ambras had been grouped by material and colour. At the Residenz in Munich, those of the Elector of Bavaria had been
  arranged into compositions on tables by size. No one would organize an art collection or an archive that way today.</p>
<p>Rudolph’s own collection, laid out on a green baize table in a long room, was arranged into three different sections: naturalia, including stuffed animals, horns, plants and
  minerals; artificialia – examples of human artifice – from jewellery to weapons; and scientifica – instruments of knowledge – from telescopes to books. All
  of creation was arranged into levels, from brute nature to higher wisdom. The Wunderkammer of Rudolph II was a whole world, a cosmos, structured in relationship to knowledge.</p>
<p>Now I’m not going to try to argue that the chaotic bookshelves in my spare bedroom or the odds and ends on my kitchen table – or yours – will ever lead to anything like the
  discovery of gravity or the creation of a national art museum; but, like the contents of Rudolf’s Wunderkammer (and those of the houses in Stuart Street), they include gifts from the
  people I have known, books I have read, souvenirs of the places I have visited, and things I have made. Collected over years, my bric-a-brac reifies the things I have learned in a lifetime.</p>
<p>And in the ways in which it has been arranged, my collections reify how I have learned these things. My books are largely arranged by subject matter; the gifts I have received in
  ascending order of preciousness: the most precious kept concealed, so that I don’t lose them, the most worthless thrown pell-mell into a bowl on the kitchen table. It is only I that can
  relegate some things to the deep storage of the attic, and it is only I who remembers what is there.</p>
<p>Like Rudolf’s Wunderkammer, my stuff is classified and structured in relationship to my knowledge of the world from which it has been taken. No wonder I find it so uncomfortable
  to throw things away.</p>
<p>I’m not on my own. Think of George on Stuart Street, or those elderly people taken away from all the clutter accumulated in their homes to medicalized ‘homes’. All too many
  quickly lose their minds, however physically comfortable their new accommodation might be. Unlike the furniture with which we equip our homes, or the buildings with which we shelter them, the
  objects with which we clutter them – the things of ‘sentimental value’ we accumulate over a lifetime – solidify our memory and our knowledge of the world. Without these
  things to anchor them, our apprehensions slip away.</p>
<p>Keep learning, keep collecting</p>
<p>Whatever Renaissance moralists or modern architects and designers might say, ornaments, bric-a-brac, clutter, call it what you will, are not necessarily a crime. Our homes are
  little worlds, arranged from fragmentary pieces of the larger one beyond them. As we learn more, as we build those little worlds, we map their geographies, tell their histories, and elucidate their
  scientific laws. But the more we learn about them as we build our homes, the more we build not just a little world, but a geography, a history, a science of ourselves.</p>
<p>And science itself, invented in the vaulted cellars of Rudolf II’s Wunderkammer, posits that the world, and our knowledge of it, are always incomplete, and always will be. On the
  one hand, new stars, microbes and elements will always be there to be discovered. On the other, each new discovery causes us to reinterpret and to reclassify what we already know. If collecting is
  a science of the self, then you should never stop collecting clutter; you should never stop sorting through its protean jumble; and you should never stop throwing junk away.</p>
<p>I, for one, hope that I do not already know everything I will ever know. I hope we all still have things to learn. In the twenty-five years since I left home I have amassed thousands of objects;
  and in the process of amassing them, their meaning has changed. Once I acquired a CD player, for example, my cassette tapes left my audio collection and joined, along with the 78-rpm records, my
  antiques collection. Now I have a Kindle, the same is happening to my library.</p>
<p>Conversely, I have thrown away things that were once very precious to me: the posters with which I decorated the walls of my student bedroom, for example, or the silver cushions with which I
  ornamented my teenage boudoir. They have gone to the rubbish collection, their use and their meaning long since expired.</p>
<p>What we collect around us reifies what we know and how we know it; but knowledge itself is dynamic. When we build a house, we remember where we have come from. When we furnish a home, we play
  with who we could be. When we decorate a room, we imagine the life we would like to live in it. When we collect and arrange, and recollect and rearrange, its contents, we discover, again and again,
  who we are.</p>
