        <h2>2. The Strengthening Cycle</h2>
<p>The Nature Principle, by Richard Louv (Algonquin, 2012), is an excellent book that deserves to be read very widely. Louv does an impressive job of setting out the
  benefits of a life that includes nature-immersion, in the face of a ubiquitous digital onslaught. It has provided many useful examples.</p>
<p>Embracing the Ordinary, by Michael Foley (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2012), is not a nature book as such, but it is a very good book that shares the philosophy of deriving great pleasure
  from small things.</p>
