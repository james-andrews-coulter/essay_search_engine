            <h2>PUBLICITY &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>It is natural to assume, at the outset of adult life, that being well known to others will help one to feel grounded, liked and safe. One will be exchanging the coldness of anonymity for the embrace of the world; long years of indifference by parents, siblings or school mates can be compensated for by a wider, more enthusiastic fraternity. Wherever one shows up, people will start to know who one is, and be a little impressed, without one having to explain too much. One will be the recipient of the near-automatic kindness and goodwill of strangers; one will, finally, with luck, fit in.</p>
<p>It’s with such hopes in mind that one can be drawn to set up a social media account and share carefully curated thoughts and images with a growing band of followers. Or seek to make a name for oneself in sport, business or the arts. Or run for public office or a company leadership role. And with talent and a good headwind, one may, however modestly, start to become a little ‘known’ (that is, asymmetrically known to people one doesn’t know oneself).</p>
<p>It may feel rather nice for a little while – but, soon enough, one is liable to come face to face with one of the less-often acknowledged facets of being in the public eye: the envy, resentment and eventual hatred of others (a sufficient number of others to create genuine agony). Every increase in one’s own visibility generates – by a kind of inevitable emotional calculus – a degree of humiliation for those still in relative obscurity and therefore a momentum in sections of the audience to attack one’s character in order to return to the status quo. There is no public success that does not, simultaneously, lead certain people to experience new feelings of failure – and so to develop desires for vengeance and comeuppance. As one’s star rises, so too other people (perhaps initially obscured and reticent), often in one’s own field or cohort, will experience themselves as more inadequate and abandoned and so willing to find revenge.</p>
<p>At some point, one will make an error. It might be very small and quite understandable, except that rather than being forgiven and understood (as one might be by friends), one will find oneself at the receiving end of an extraordinary outpouring of anger, sanctimony and moralism. The bullying will begin – and though it might at first appear accidental and passing, one will discover an iron-clad law of publicity: that one cannot ever be reliably loved and steadily approved of by large numbers of strangers without being assailed by the resentment of others. The newspaper clippings and social media accounts will attest to as much, containing as they will constant references to one’s flaws and apparent vileness. One will hope that the enemies will eventually tire, but so long as one is known, one will be tormented.</p>
<p>The search for publicity is, at heart, a quest for a shortcut to friendship. Yet real kindness is never available in a public arena. It is the fruit of a few intimate and reciprocal connections. It cannot be won remotely or one-sidedly. If it is safety one seeks, one must definitively and immediately cease to strive to be known to people one doesn’t know and concentrate instead on building up genuine bonds that can survive one’s errors and endure for life. Paradoxically and poignantly, it is most often the very anxious who feel a particular longing for the embrace of fame; but it is especially they (given their fragility) who should be warned away from its ultimately always vengeful arms. Being entirely forgotten by the world is no curse or sign of failure; it is the very basis for a contented and safe life in which one swaps the prospect of acolytes and mean-minded detractors for the deeper satisfaction of true friends. The moment anyone becomes famous should always be considered – by those who really care for them – as a time for mourning.</p>
