        <h2>PLANNING THE CEREMONY</h2>
<p>The desire to have a different sort of marriage (more realistic, honest, resilient and mature) logically inspires a desire for a different sort of wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>A full set of instruction follows.</p>
<p>Ahead of the ceremony itself, aside from the obvious practicalities (rings, invitations, after-party), the couple should make two specific preparations:</p>
<p>The Book of Imperfections</p>
<p>The partners should each buy a handsome, solid, empty book and head it ‘The Book of Imperfections.’ Ensuring that the books are attractive and long-lasting signals their seriousness within the couple.</p>
<p>Filling in each book will be a matter of many hours. In it, partners should record the severe and deep failings of their characters – as well as they can understand them at the moment – but knowing there are sure to be others, which may possibly be even worse. As a proof of love and trust, they should candidly admit to all that they know is bad about them. Outlined in the book are the broken parts of them, for which they need forgiveness. They idea is to be frightened of – and humbled by – the power this gives the other person.</p>
<p>Typical entries will detail failures of patience, of humour, of insight and of loyalty. The book should contain an honest audit of the darkest sides of the self.</p>
<p>Photographs of the two partners as children</p>
<p>Partners should – in addition – find a representative picture of themselves as children (before adolescence). The picture should in some way endear the viewer, though not in any overtly sentimental or naive way. The point is to be reminded that this big and often rather hard-to-like adult was also once a child.</p>
<p>The presence of this picture should draw the couple – at testing moments – to the memory of their more hopeful and dignified sides.</p>
