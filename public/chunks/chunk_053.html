        <h2>Parties &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Parties can be especially melancholic occasions. From the moment we arrive at most of them, we’ll notice that intense efforts have been made to generate a welcoming and sociable atmosphere. Someone will have rigged up a sound system; there might be balloons bouncing around the ceiling; drinks may be brightly coloured. More significantly, some extremely well-meaning people will be keen for us to have a good time. As the evening unfolds, they might cheerfully come up to us and ask: Are you well? Are you having fun?</p>
<p>The intentions are moving, but the results can make us very sad. The vast majority of parties proceed with the view that what helps people to relax and feel content are displays of happiness, especially exuberant happiness. It is seeing another’s good mood, hearing their stories of success and their joyful description of forward momentum, that will help us to tap into our own sources of delight and confidence.</p>
<p>It sounds logical, except that the truth of our psychology is stranger. What really breaks us out of our isolation is not to see others cheering, but to witness that the troubles that beset us – the shame, guilt, regret, despair, irritation and self-disgust – are not merely personal curses, as we had suspected in the echo chambers of our fearful minds, but have counterparts in our fellow humans. It is the sorrows of others that confirm us in our gloom and help to raise our spirits.</p>
<p>With a new psychology of companionship in mind, we can start to imagine what a properly sociable party might look like. There might not be any loud, upbeat music, perhaps just a sorrowful Bach cello concerto or a Requiem Mass somewhere in the background. The host would invite us to share everything about our lives that was less than perfect and that society had censored in the world beyond. We would have the chance to reveal how dark some of our thoughts were, and the extent of our anxiety. Heading home after such an evening, we would be sincerely happy because we had finally been able to offload, and to hear from others, how much of life is about sadness.</p>
<p>It is easy to feel that one must be a misanthrope for not wanting to attend parties, but the opposite may in reality be true. We hate most parties because we are unusually keen for human connection, which we simply can’t find at the level of depth we crave at the average gathering. We want to be alone not because we genuinely don’t like company but because we like the real thing so much, and because the simulacrum of company on offer reminds us too powerfully of an isolation that breaks our hearts.</p>
<p>We are generally left standing at parties, surrounded by forty people, feeling more isolated than on the surface of Mercury, because the forty party-goers, who could have offered each other so much, are collectively trapped in an ideology of false jubilance. In a better future, we would learn how to throw those paradoxical-sounding occasions, melancholy parties. There would be no more jolliness on display. There would only be some unusually vulnerable and candid people sitting around, confessing how hard they found it to be human. That would be something to properly celebrate.</p>
