        <h3>¶ Equality and Envy</h3>
<p>We are repeatedly told that we are equal. This sounds like a great idea, but it carries an unexpected psychological burden. The reality is that we are equal before the law, equal in rights, but we are definitely not equal in our circumstances. The modern age combines an ideology of equality with radical material inequality.</p>
<p>This has led to a proliferation of envy. Envy is a curious emotion in that we don’t feel it in relation to everyone who has more than us. We envy those who have more than us and to whom we feel equal. Nowadays we would be unlikely to feel envious of a member of the British monarchy. Their world is too remote from our own, their accents too odd, their characters alien. Despite them having much more than us, despite their palaces, carriages and art works, we can consider their lives without the slightest distress. However, when we hear of someone our age, with a slightly larger apartment than ours, a somewhat more dynamic career and an ability to send their children to a slightly better school, our envy may grow boundless and quasi-obsessive.</p>
<p>It is the feeling of equality, and not just differences in wealth and achievement, that drives envy. The closer two people feel, the more equal they are in each other’s eyes, and the more any divergence of success will have the power to dispirit and enrage them. And the problem with the modern world is that it constantly informs us that we are all equal deep down, while simultaneously holding up for our torture examples of people who have secured uncommon degrees of fame and wealth for themselves.</p>
<p>In the old world, it would not have occurred to any ordinary person to envy an aristocrat or monarch. These exalted characters lived in separate realms and went to great lengths to show the rest of the world how different they were, and how inconceivable it was that one could ever get to be like them. Their clothes, habits and ways of life made it clear that one should never assume they were normal in any way.</p>
<p>Louis XIV of France liked to wander about in ermine cloaks and gold brocade coats. He carried a golden stick. He sometimes donned a suit of armour. It was extremely haughty and unfair, of course, but it did have one great advantage. You could not possibly believe that you, in all your profane ordinariness, would ever reach the summit. You couldn’t possibly envy the mighty, because envy only begins with the theoretical possibility that one might be rightfully owed what the envied person already has.</p>
<p>By contrast, modernity was founded on an apparently generous sense that everyone is owed the same things. Not in terms of current possessions and status, but in terms of potential. Yet it then performed a particularly challenging move: it made sure that we don’t all end up having the same things. It combined the sense of possibility with the reality of inequality, and so opened up a new terrain of suffering.</p>
