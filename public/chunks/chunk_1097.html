        <h2>The Sun</h2>
<p>We may have been tempted to pretend that we came to this part of the world to commune with the spirit of the ancient Athenian statesman and orator Pericles, or to admire the exquisite statuette of Athena Promachos in the Acropolis museum, or to pay homage to the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae. The reality is far simpler, and in some quarters, more embarrassing to admit: we have come to get warm; we have come to see the world in a primal blinding light. We have come to worship the sun.</p>
<p>It’s been the curse of our civilization to have managed to create ostensibly comfortable homes for ourselves in regions that only a hardy minority would previously have dared to inhabit. In our fragile beginnings, our species had no option but to cling tightly to the clement equatorial zones, but thanks to our ingenuity, we now have everything we need to survive — apparently in comfort — in the near-total darkness, snowstorms and gales of Rjukan (Norway), Barrow (Alaska) and Oymyakon (Russia). But there is a distinction between surviving and flourishing. We may manage to live in London or Gothenburg all year round, but that does not mean that we are remotely able to thrive in their continual mists and vicious, freezing rains.</p>
<p>It cannot be a coincidence that every ancient culture — from the Achaemenids to the ancient Egyptians, the Mesopotamians to the Mayans — honoured and made offerings to the sun so that it might continue to shine its benevolent, life-giving rays on them. Our contemporary veneration of our star lacks any analogous cultural endorsement or prestige; the common associations are around parasols and cocktails by a pool, rather than — as an Egyptian priest would have emphasised — the maintenance of the world spirit in the indomitable form of the sun god Ra.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even without an official cult, the sun achieves its work of repair. Out here on the bleached rocks, looking out over a scorched, treeless landscape, we remember another side of ourselves that had been lost in the preceding six months of darkness. This self can be less envious of others, more serene, less concerned with control, readier to accept the unknown, in touch with its own senses. We find new arguments for hope in the brightness; the uninterrupted enveloping warmth hints that we won’t, perhaps, need to be so afraid, that we can take a chance to trust and that there may be alternatives to anxiety.</p>
<p>Given all that we know about nastiness and despair, cheerfulness is a phenomenal achievement — and the sun-filled places that occasionally inspire it are bearers of their own hugely significant and, in their way, properly sacred wisdom.## The Funfair</p>
<p>Most of the time, our pleasure doesn’t even come into it. We have to suffer; we have no option but to earn a living, provide for our dependants and endure difficult days. But then come other occasions — far less frequent in number — when, for a while, nothing is expected of us, when the external obligations cease and we are finally free to seek to satisfy only, or chiefly, ourselves.</p>
<p>This might sound like a blessedly uncomplicated brief, but our moments of release have a habit of ushering in difficulties of their own. What are we in fact supposed to do? Who are we, outside of duty? Where should we go? What do we enjoy?</p>
<p>Collectively, our societies spend a great deal more time thinking about how we should make money than how we might fruitfully spend it. Infinite care is devoted to the accumulation of capital and all its associated disciplines: accountancy, management, law… But when it comes to spending, the suggested manoeuvres incline towards a peculiar uniformity and lack of attunement to the distinctive texture of each of our unique personalities. There is a high chance that, without great care, we may end up buying a trip to Disneyland, a skiing holiday, a mountain bike or a barbecue set.</p>
<p>There might not be anything obviously wrong with such investments, except that they might be fundamentally better suited to someone else — a painful realisation that might not come to us until we’re halfway up the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad or in a heap at the bottom of a red run. Each of us was — at the start of our lives — gloriously peculiar. We were all very odd small children way back, with set ideas on the wayward things we wanted to do. Our interests paid little attention to the mainstream: we wanted to tie string round some trees or sew some socks for the guinea pig, we had a collection of seeds we tried to germinate, we drew imaginary worlds, we had our own language. We didn’t always favour seven nights all-inclusive in the Balearics.</p>
<p>In their touchingly intense attempts to make us smile, funfairs bring our dilemmas to a head. Their desperation reveals just how elusive happiness can be. We may sense — with mounting conviction and regret — that our joys cannot reliably be delivered by the Magic Mouse rollercoaster or the Loop Fighter, Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway or the Haunted Mansion.</p>
<p>We may be forced to acknowledge just how much weirder we are than the mainstream narrative allows us to be. We don’t actually enjoy birthdays, we are terrified of Christmas, we hate arcades, we get bored during concerts — not because we are misanthropic (though we are that too, of course) but because we are complicated and knotty people who might be most cheered up by a chance to cry for a while or visit a housing project in Turkmenistan, dredge a lake or assist residents in a hospice.</p>
<p>We can thank funfairs for reminding us — to the smells of candyfloss and the shrieks from the Big Dipper — that having fun is one of the most difficult and grave of all the challenges we ever face.</p>
