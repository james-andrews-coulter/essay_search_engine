        <h3>Thirdly: The power of the imagination</h3>
<p>One way to frame the issue is to suggest that, very often, people kill themselves because of a failure in their powers of imagination. They simply cannot picture a better life than the agonised one they currently have; they lose the ability to conjure up images of a more bearable way to be.</p>
<p>This suggests the importance of giving the imagination every encouragement it needs to do its life-sustaining work – and of trying to understand its workings and optimal inputs. By imagination, what we really mean is the power to summon up alternatives. When we are suicidal, it is not possible to imagine finding another job or retraining or shifting profession. We can’t imagine not minding about the gossip being spread about us or finding another partner and letting ourselves trust someone again. We can’t imagine getting by in a wheelchair, living on a very modest budget or relocating to another country.</p>
<p>It is therefore key to assert a theoretical truth from the outset: with sufficient imagination, almost any problem can be worked around. There are substitutes for most of what we have lost; not ideal replacements, but viable ones. If one door has closed, the imagination can, in time, find another. Every life can be rendered bearable, however unpromising the initial ingredients. If 200 doors have closed, there will be a door number 201 to locate somewhere. If plan A has failed, we can eventually pull together a plan B or C … or Z. There are an infinite number of ways to lead a life – and it is simply part of our illness that we cannot, as yet, see beyond the one way of life that we loved and have lost. Like a grief-stricken, abandoned lover, we can’t picture that there are alternative candidates; but just as we might meet someone new, so can we determine new ways to live.</p>
<p>There are other cities we can go to and completely new kinds of work we can try. There are lovers who have a completely different approach to intimacy from those we have known to date. We are grown-ups – that is, people with choices. We are not the small children we once were who had to depend on their parents for everything and were imprisoned by narrow circumstances. We can build ourselves a small hut on the edge of the desert if we want to. We can work as a carer or retrain as a psychotherapist, find employment in a prison or in a hospice. We can help staff a suicide line (we have a lot of experience in the field already) or volunteer in an emergency shelter. We can change our names. If we’re feeling shy and defeated, we don’t have to go out and see anyone ever again. We can live by ourselves, mind our own business, read the classics and tend to our garden. We can have a breakdown and then recover; a lot of people do. Should the mood take us, we can throw ourselves into learning a new skill or take a university degree in Sanskrit by correspondence course. We can find the love we need; we only require two friends, or even just one, to get by. Many people might be cruel, but a few are infinitely compassionate and kind and we can go out and find them and not let them go. We could make a new circle of friends among recently released convicts (they tend to be very bright and very free of social snobbery). We could go to a monastery or a nunnery or look up a few old and trusted friends and suggest living together in an unconventional, small and supportive commune. We can rid ourselves of the toxic values we grew up with and become – in the best way – outcasts and eccentrics.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stick to the script we thought we’d be following all our lives. We might have wanted to do so, but we are profoundly flexible creatures. When we arrived on the Earth, our mental wiring was loose enough that we could have developed into excellent foragers in the Kalahari Desert, Latin scholars in a university or accountants in the logistics industry. Our biology is elastic. We may have lost a little of that primordial flexibility, and it might no longer be so easy to pick up new languages or physical skills, but we remain eminently equipped to acquire new tricks. Other people – noble and interesting people – have been here before us. There have been exiled Russian princes who have learnt how to become tennis teachers; émigré South Vietnamese army generals who have started kindergartens; divorcees who have remarried in their eighties; shamed executives who have opened flourishing corner shops.</p>
<p>In order to increase our chances of survival, we need to feed and massage our imaginations; we need to provide them with examples of alternative narratives, so that they can grow more skilled at throwing out plan Bs when fate commands. We must give them books to read about countesses who found happiness with manual workers, potentates who learnt to get by on modest pensions and cities that were rebuilt after being burnt to the ground. Whatever way we happen to be living, we should constantly force ourselves to picture different, more arduous, but still bearable ways to be, imagining ourselves as pilots who are at all times wondering what alternative runway they might head to in order to land their plane in an emergency. It is worthwhile to spend time considering how we might survive without any friends, without a reputation, without health, without any love or without much money. Only a few of us will ever write short stories for a living, but very many of us will be called upon by fate to rewrite the stories of our lives. That is the true destiny and function of the imagination.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s not easy to picture other lives for ourselves and so – understandably – sometimes we feel like we want to extinguish the one we have. This book seeks to provide alternative scenarios to the ones we have relied on until now – and the strength to move towards them. Suicide is something that a desperate and depleted imagination instinctively likes to turn to, and we shouldn’t be terrified if it does drift that way. The Stoics allowed their imaginations to wander a while and their lack of squeamishness at what they found is bracing. We could – of course – end it all. That will always remain the great fallback. But given what we know about the impact of such an act, we should use everything in our power not to do it. Instead, we should be provoked by the intellectual puzzle before us: how can we remain alive, when it would be so easy and so tempting to die? How else might we get by, given how many possibilities have been closed to us? How can we rebuild our futures creatively out of the ruins of our old lives?</p>
