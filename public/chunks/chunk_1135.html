        <h2>5. How to Keep a Home</h2>
<p>I think you can guess what your homework will be for this chapter . . .</p>
<p>I want you to clean the floor. Choose a time when you’ve got time to do it properly – the time you might normally set aside for watching TV, or reading a book. Make
  sure you do it as well as you can: if that floor isn’t perfectly clean, you’re not finished yet. If there are other people in the house with you, invite them to join you. Treat this
  task as is if it were the most important and enjoyable thing you have to do this week.</p>
<p>How was it for you? When did you do it? How long did it take? Were you satisfied with the result? More importantly, did you enjoy doing it? Did you manage to persuade anyone to join you? Did
  they enjoy it too?</p>

<p>Go for walk – a walk you usually take.</p>
<p>It could be the walk to work, or the one you take on Saturday morning, to the shops. Take a map with you of where you’re going, and where you’ve been. Mark on it, as you go, the
  places you might stop at regularly along the way: the place you pick up a coffee, perhaps, or a newspaper. It could be as simple as the place you wait for a bus. Take a photo of each of these
  places, and when you get home, take a look at them: they are your home when you are away from home.</p>
<p>Why do you choose these places? Why one coffee stand over another? Why one side of the bus stop rather than another? What qualities appeal to you about these places?</p>
