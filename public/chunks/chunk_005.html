            <h3>1. The confessional friendship</h3>
<p>The tennis match, as always, was a joy. In the club room – deserted at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday – Kieran and Salim are having their customary post-match glass of beer. Kieran is bracing himself. It’s a tricky moment. He’s been having trouble in his marriage and only last night lost his temper, shouted horribly at his partner, slammed the kitchen door and started wondering about divorce. Not that he feels justified. He’s terrified it’s all his fault. But can it really just be his fault? He doesn’t know what to think or feel. Is his life unravelling?</p>
<p>At the tennis club, people are all (it seems) either happily married or happily separated. Everyone is always ‘great’. And so, when Salim asks, ‘How are things?’, can Kieran dare to tell the truth? They’ve always enjoyed chatting, but they’ve never ventured into this kind of territory before. Can Kieran risk letting Salim know about what he is suffering? It would be such a relief to discuss it properly, and yet what if Salim was quietly horrified?</p>
<p>We are required to have two selves. On the one hand there’s the outer, public self that we assiduously curate – based around the old-sounding but very much current notion of ‘respectability’: we want, and need, to come across to others as deserving of their approval. And then there’s the inner self: the confusion of thoughts, feelings, impulses, longings, regrets, fears and phobias we know ourselves to be.</p>
<p>This gives rise to a tension that can grow to alarming proportions. The ‘respectable’ self has to edit out so much that is really going on, and causing trouble, below the surface. The ‘respectable’ self can’t be open about any of the following: what sex is really like for us; the ways in which we tend to self-sabotage; the extent of our self-loathing; what we are ashamed of in our past and what we feel guilty about in the present; what our childhood was actually like and the things or people we in fact hate, in the face of a seeming social consensus that they are to be approved of or admired. The gap between who we feel ourselves to be and who we feel we have to be looms ever wider. It can feel impossible to be liked and understood at the same time.</p>
<p>We are always secretly scanning others, hoping to discern some hint that they may be more receptive to the less respectable (but psychologically central) parts of who we are; we make little probing initiatives – things we can back off from if need be.</p>
<p>Why has Kieran thought of Salim as someone who might understand? He has been touched by a kind of gentleness in his on-court rival. They’re pretty evenly matched and Salim is very competitive, but when he loses he always goes out of his way to say how much he enjoyed the game; there’s a delicacy to it – a desire not to sully Kieran’s victory by being a sore loser. It’s a microscopic hint, but it’s still a hint. Here is someone who is saying it might be OK to lose; despite trying one’s hardest. Failure needn’t be a humiliation.</p>
<p>So, when Salim asks the customary ‘All well?’, Kieran utters the fundamental opening words of intimacy: ‘Not so good, actually.’ It can sound like such a tiny move and yet one might go for years without making it. He doesn’t blurt everything out in one go. He tentatively mentions a diﬃcult argument; he suggests he needs to make a decision. There’s no detail, no great confession, just the quiet implication that there’s so much more to be said.</p>
<p>For Salim, it’s not entirely easy to respond. How should he meet these words? He could close it off with a polite formula of indifference: ‘It’ll all blow over; it always does.’ But instead he takes the answering risk: he lets out a low, empathic ‘mmmm’ and murmurs, ‘Tell me …’ And gradually Kieran begins to unfold the trauma of last night, and what led up to it.</p>
<p>What we forget, as we gear ourselves up to take the first confessional step, is the longing on the other side: Salim has his hidden troubles too, but he has been paralysed by fear of what his nice acquaintances might think of him if he were to be open about them. Kieran’s vulnerability is a signal he’s been waiting for.</p>
<p>Not this afternoon, but over time, Kieran’s confession offers Salim permission (which he stands so much in need of ) to start to confess the very different but equally real burdens he’s been secretly labouring with: his estrangement from his highly successful brother; his shame at having – as he sees it – made so little of the wonderful opportunities life has offered him.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is psychologically crucial. It’s not merely that one sees the compassion in another’s face, but that one discovers that the other is just as muddled, fractured, hurt and confused as we are. The dial of normality is reset. The lonely sense of being freakishly awful is more accurately interpreted: we are simply like others are on the inside. We are suffering from a powerful illusion of what everyone else is like; and now – thanks to friendship – reality and self-perception can be more sanely aligned.</p>
<p>The conversation at the club was a few months ago. Kieran and Salim still love playing tennis together but relish, even more, the chance to talk at length about certain tricky things after the game.</p>
<p>A confessional friendship meets our need to be understood and liked at the same time.</p>
