            <h3>You could finally leave school</h3>
<p>Technically, most of us leave school at 16 or 18 – an event that tends to be vividly etched in our memory and surrounded by considerable ceremony and emotion. Yet, despite appearances, many of us don’t manage to leave school at that point at all. In a deep part of our minds, we may still be there, deep into adulthood, not sitting in a classroom precisely, but in terms of how our minds work, as much stuck within the confines of a school-based worldview as if we were showing up for assembly every day. This generates immense and unnecessary degrees of unhappiness and compromise for ourselves.</p>
<p>These are some hallmarks of an enduring school-like way of thinking:</p>
<p>• A belief that those in authority know what they are doing and that one’s task is to jump through the hoops they set for us. There is a desire to please teachers and win prizes, cups and ribbons.</p>
<p>• A sense that there is an implicit curriculum out there – an externally mandated map of what one needs to do to succeed – and that a wise person must dutifully subscribe to its demands.</p>
<p>• A feeling that when it’s going well, work should feel irksome, dull and somewhat pointless. Schools teach us to forget, or ignore, the clues offered to us by our own boredom. They teach us dangerous degrees of patience. They subtly train us in intellectual masochism.</p>
<p>• You’re doing it for someone else; an audience; your teachers, your parents and their substitutes in adult life. Make us proud. You have to shine. We’ve given you so much. What matters is the performance, not any inner sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>• Authority is benign. They want what is good for you and they speak on behalf of your long-term interests. Don’t think you could ever know better; distrust your instincts. We’ll look after you. If you follow our rules, you will thrive.</p>
<p>• The exam (and all its successors) are fundamentally accurate. Those who know have worked out the ultimate test of your value. You are what you score.</p>
<p>• Every school is a miniature society, equipped with a strong sense of what values to revere and codes to follow. Bullies lurk, ready to mock and identify any departures from the norm. You can’t escape them; they are next to you in class every day. They will spot and persecute the weirdos; they can ruin your life. You learn to cower and adjust your attitudes. Following the herd is paramount.</p>
<p>These ways of thinking don’t require us to be sitting in a geography class. We might be in an office selling garden furniture to the Belgian market and thinking like this; we might have children of our own and by all appearances be an adult, yet still be living as though there were ‘exams’ to pass and cups to be won.</p>
<p>What would it mean to break the mould? What would it mean finally to leave school? It would involve knowing some of the following:</p>
<p>• There is no one way, no one set path to fulfilment laid out by authority figures. ‘They’ don’t know. No one knows.</p>
<p>• The safe path may be dangerous to our flourishing.</p>
<p>• Our boredom is a vital tool. It tells us what is slowly killing us, and reminds us that time is monstrously short.</p>
<p>• Authority is not by definition benign. The teachers and their substitutes have no real plan for you except in so far as it suits their own advancement. It might look as if they want your supreme good, but in reality they want you to play their game for their own benefit. At the end, they have no proper prize to offer you. They will give you a colourful card and send you to the golf course and the grave and you will have wasted your life.</p>
<p>• It doesn’t matter what the bullies think. No one is normal. You can dare to make enemies; indeed, you must do so as the price to pay for having developed a character and found something to believe in.</p>
<p>We should not be tough on ourselves for lingering so long. School is an immensely impressive system. We start there when we are not much bigger than a chair. For more than a decade, it is all we know. It is the outside world, and those who love us most tell us we should respect it. It speaks with immense authority not just about itself, but about life in general. It is sold to us as a preparation for the whole of existence. But the main thing it does is to prepare us for yet more school; it is an education in how to thrive within its own profoundly peculiar rules, with only a tenuous connection to the world beyond.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, we might finally work up the courage to leave our inner school – be it at 28, 45 or 62 – and enter the wider, boundless world we have been in flight from for too long.</p>
