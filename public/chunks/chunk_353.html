        <h3>4 The meaning of life</h3>
<p>Given all this, we may wonder to what we should devote our energies. There is constant pressure to accumulate more capital — but there is a grander project to hand that is unquestionably closer to what is most noble and fundamental about us: the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>It is knowledge that powered the project of modernity, and there is so much further for us to go. The list of what we still need to know is long: why the universe was ordered at the start and what began its entropy, how photons and dark energy operate, how life began (and therefore the chemical process required to ignite it), the causes of the explosion and diversification of multicellular animals at the beginning of the Cambrian era, how animals’ homing instinct operates, how solar energy can be harnessed — and, not least, how the human brain works.</p>
<p>We are, in many ways, a revolting species. But the 1260 cubic centimetres of matter on top of our spinal columns is the most precious substance ever generated — and the only one capable of standing witness to, and interpreting, the universe. This must therefore be its destiny, properly understood.</p>
<p>We may be confused as to our purpose. But the value of every life is assured in so far as we have attempted to fathom any piece, however minor, of the original mystery in which our species was sunk — or been in some way of service to those who are able to do so. Humans are the knowing animal. Modernity may be a time of confusion, yet the trajectory of a necessary future is clear: not just to continue to suffer in recurring cycles, but also — in ever more detailed ways, in line with our highest potential — to illuminate a little more of the primordial darkness; to understand our way out of the perils of modernity.</p>
