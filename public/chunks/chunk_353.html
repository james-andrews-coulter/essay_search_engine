        <h3>— Make a plan for atonement</h3>
<p>In our secular world, we have grown embarrassingly unimaginative about our strategies for atonement. We can think only of prison, as though to sit in a narrow cell for a few years were truly the best way in which to redeem every ill. But outside of protecting the public from actively violent criminals, there is almost no way in which prison properly helps society to deal with its demons.</p>
<p>Every transgressor – especially those whom modern society never seeks to lock up – should draw up an ‘atonement plan’, precisely related to the nature of their failure. There we must detail – for the benefit of those we have wronged and perhaps a few curious strangers too – what we intend to contribute going forward in order to rectify the damage we have done, psychological as much as material. There should be offers to explain, to recompense financially, to give up time and to perform what Christians call ‘good works’. The Christian of history went on pilgrimages, wrote out passages of the Bible and worked for the sick. We should become comparable experts in the hard work of repair.</p>
