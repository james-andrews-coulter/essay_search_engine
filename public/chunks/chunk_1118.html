        <h2>High Park Sewage Pumping Station</h2>
<p>Toronto is, perhaps, one of the world’s less inspiring cities. The guidebooks try hard to get us to go to Ripley’s Aquarium, or up the CN Tower; the Royal Ontario Museum has some interesting fossils and birds and some poignant canoes that the indigenous people used to ride in before their lands were seized and their children murdered by Europeans. And for those who enjoy that sort of thing, there’s an extravagant Edwardian castle called Casa Loma on a hill or, when inspiration has properly waned, a Distillery Historic District filled with small boutiques selling craftwork and jewellery.
Still, much of the time, we may simply want to remain in our hotel room.
This was not the way that tourism used to be done. Traditionally, on arrival in a new town or city, visitors would ask to be shown the fortifications, the stock exchange and the waterworks. They understood a place not through its junk-filled boutiques or galleries but far more usefully via its civic and military infrastructure.
The same principle should continue to apply today, for nowhere is boring for long once we ask where the poo flows or the power comes in. These matters belong to a hidden web of services that illuminate the spirit of a city and its people and evoke an unshowy reality that grounds and stabilises us.
The world is littered with obscure buildings, boxes, roadside sheds and unmarked huts that contribute to a feeling that we don’t understand the wider framework of society and that we are the playthings of obscure forces. Small children are at least wise enough to ask: they insist on being told what’s in the grey cabin at the end of the road or what lies beneath the large manhole cover. But most parents do such a good job of fending off their inquiries that by the time they are 8, they have stopped asking entirely and want to watch TV instead.
We should resume where we left off many years ago. On a visit to Toronto, we should dare to get properly to grips with the sewage system. If we are fortunate, we might end up going for a walk in High Park and there coming across a brown, one-storey brick box the size of a shipping container known (or rather not very well known) as the High Park Sewage Pumping station. Inside, a powerful motor is responsible for pushing tonnes of the area’s poo from a concrete-lined chamber a kilometre or two east to the city’s second largest wastewater facility near the mouth of the Humber River, the Humber Treatment Plant, a walled-off, awe inspiring monolith unmentioned in any tourist publication, with a remarkable capacity to treat 473,000 cubic metres of waste per day.
Montaigne tells us that in ancient Egypt, it was the custom in the middle of feasts for servants to enter bearing skeletons, to remind the revellers of reality at a time when they might be most at risk of forgetting it. In a similar spirit, in the future, wiser cities wouldn’t just bury their sewage plants and pumps behind some trees in a park. They would illuminate them, hand out maps of them to tourists and build a gigantic transparent piece of pipe in the middle of the city so that all citizens could watch their debris flow by every new day. Such vivid evidence of our common fleshly reality would help us lose our fear of not being good enough and weaken our sense of intimidation in front of so-called important people. Sewage systems shouldn’t merely secretly spirit away our waste; they should alongside galleries and temples be
given a chance to educate and cheer us on.</p>
