        <h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>
<p>Being ready for a return of the illness will help us calibrate our expectations and render us appropriately patient and unfrightened in the face of relapses. We should be aware of the special price we have to pay when we allow ourselves to declare the battle over, when we announce to ourselves and to friends that we are well again—and then recognize that we have actually been hasty and naive and need to return to the front once more. It can feel especially bitter to have to crouch low again when we felt we now had the right to stand tall. But it’s better to adopt a stance of ongoing, permanent readiness than submit to cycles of hope followed by panic. We fell ill over many years—our whole childhood might have been the incubating laboratory—and it should not surprise us if we are never totally impervious again.</p>
