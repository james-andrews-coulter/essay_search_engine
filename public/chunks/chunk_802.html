        <h2>BEAUTY IS VERY IMPORTANT</h2>
<p>This might seem a strange place to start because normally beauty looks like the outcome of immense wealth: elegant possessions, a gracious home, and trips to Venice and St Petersburg. But these expensive things are just the most obvious instances of beauty. As our tastes become more sensitive and our imaginations more expansive, the link with money falls away—because a great many truly lovely sights are readily available almost everywhere to those who know how to look.</p>
<p>Around his modest home, Chomei—with a sensitive eye—discovered endless sources of beauty: fall leaves, fruit trees in blossom, melting snow, the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the rain beating down on the roof. All were free. He was entranced by flowers: “In spring I gaze upon swathes of wisteria that hang shining in the west, like the purple clouds that bear the soul to heaven.” He found a delightful spot on the hillside: “If the day is fine I look out over Mount Kohata, Fushimi Village, Toba and Hatsukashi” and “at night, the fireflies in the nearby grass blend their little lights with the fires the fishermen make at distant Makinoshima: no one owns a splendid view.”</p>
<p>It’s partly the idea of having to cope with constant ugliness that makes a lower-level economic life so frightening. Chomei’s antidote is to stress the continuing opportunities for visual delight, even on the most minimal of incomes.</p>
