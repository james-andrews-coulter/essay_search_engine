        <h2>Mercy</h2>
<p>We might long for a god who could forgive, who could be boundlessly merciful, who could understand that despite everything, deep inside, we did mean well. It’s just that we messed up, we got carried away, we were stupid and we’re so, so sorry. This god would look at us with a slightly severe and pained expression, but then would take us in their arms and say in a low, kind voice, ‘I know you have tried. I know you are good. You will always have my love. I do not judge like the others.’ We long for mercy personified.</p>
