            <h2>TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY</h2>
<p>Although we say that time is precious, our actions reveal our real priorities: We devote a huge portion of our conscious existence to making and trying to accumulate money. We tend to have a highly concrete and detailed sense of accounting around finances, while time invisibly slips away.</p>
<p>Chomei, on the contrary, had a keen sense of the value of his own time, without interruptions, impediments or duties: “I can choose to rest and laze as I wish, there is no one to stand in my way or to shame me for my idleness.”</p>
<p>He had time to practice playing the lute, or biwa : “my skills are poor,” he admitted—but then he had no audience, he wasn’t trying to please or impress anyone. “I play music, I sing alone, simply for my own fulfillment.”</p>
<p>He read and reread the same few favorite books, which he came to know almost by heart. He had time to reflect and to write. He meditated, took long walks, and spent a lot of time contemplating the moon.</p>
<p>His activities were self-directed: He did them simply because he found them enjoyable, not because anyone had asked him or because they were expected of a civilized individual. And he had this luxury only because he had disregarded the nexus of money and the pursuit of status which is so closely connected to it.</p>
<p>Theoretically Chomei could have found a job, however lowly. But he preferred to cut his expenses down to zero in the name of something truly valuable: his time.</p>
