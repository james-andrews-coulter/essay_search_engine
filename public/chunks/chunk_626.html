        <h3>¶ Love Me as I Am</h3>
<p>Our culture strongly inclines us to the view that genuine love must involve complete acceptance of another person in their good and especially somewhat bad sides. In moments of fury with our partners, we may be tempted to dismiss their complaints against us with the cry: ‘Love me as I am’.</p>
<p>But in truth, none of us should want to remain exactly as we are – and therefore none of us should too strongly want another person to love (as opposed to tolerate or simply forgive) what is warped within us.</p>
<p>Genuine love might be defined as gently and kindly helping someone to become the best version of themselves rather than accepting them precisely as they are. It isn’t a betrayal of love for someone to try to help us evolve or to teach us to be better people; it may be the highest proof of genuine commitment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, under the sway of Romantic ideology that makes us suspicious of emotional education, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students. We don’t accept the legitimacy, let alone nobility, of others’ desire to teach us and can’t acknowledge areas where we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover’s education that would enable criticism to be moulded into sensible-sounding lessons and to be heard as caring attempts to rejig the more troublesome aspects of our personalities.</p>
<p>At the first sign that the other is adopting a teacherly tone, we tend to assume that we are being ‘attacked’ and betrayed. We therefore close our ears to the instruction, reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher.</p>
<p>Our stance is deeply understandable: to the mother, everything about the tiny infant is delightful; they wouldn’t change even the smallest thing; their baby is perfect just as it is. Our idea of love has taken this attitude to heart: it’s what (we think) love is supposed to be like. The suggestion that another could change, grow, or improve is taken as an insult to love.</p>
<p>The problem is: the mother never in fact loved us just as we were. She hoped we would keep growing up. And the need is still there. Our bodies may be fully formed, but our psyches always have some way to go. We shouldn’t hold it against our lovers if they don’t love us as we are, if they’d sweetly like us to be a bit different.</p>
