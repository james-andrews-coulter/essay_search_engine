        <h2>History &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Even though history is filled with stories of terrible events (wars, massacres, etc.), many people still manage to believe in progress. They trust that things broadly get better and that humanity has a bright future ahead of it.</p>
<p>However, melancholic people are not able to share this kind of optimism. When they look at the past, they see a degree of horror and pain they can’t get over. In particular, they are conscious that many civilisations have existed that were brutally snuffed out – even though they would have had so much to give us.</p>
<p>The melancholy mind is drawn to moments when history appears to confirm a thesis familiar from individual life: that the best do not typically win, that the prizes often go to the undeserving and that a nobility of spirit can lead to an inability to summon up the strength to defeat an aggressive enemy. In the ruins of old civilisations, the melancholy observe a moral tale about the fate of virtue and honour in a rough world.</p>
<p>The melancholy may, for example, turn their thoughts to Britain at the start of the 5th century. There were symmetrically laid out towns in Verulamium (St Albans), Lindum (Lincoln) and Eboracum (York). There were limestone and marble baths at Aquae Sulis (Bath). Shops sold amphorae filled with olive oil from southern Spain and wine from Gaul; you could buy salted fish from Greece and preserved olives from Sicily. There was a high degree of order and some justice. And then in a few short years, four centuries of Roman rule in Britain came to a sorry end. The German tribes moved forward irresistibly across the Rhine, politics in Rome grew especially treacherous and the legions were abruptly summoned back to the centre. In villas around Britain, there was no time to make adequate preparations. Marauding bands of Saxons, Picts and Scotti looted and destroyed everything in sight. Much was laid to waste without any identifiable benefit to the invaders, perhaps simply to lessen their intimidation in the face of so much refinement. Anyone identified with Roman rule was at risk. In the chaos, fleeing families buried valuables in their gardens, in the vain hope that Rome might one day recover, and they would be able to return and restart their lives.</p>
<p>There were to be no hot baths again in Britain for twelve centuries and no more classical buildings for 1,235 years. People stopped using money and went back to bartering; the roads fell into disrepair; the towns emptied. Four-storey stone buildings with porticos and Corinthian columns gave way to thatched wooden huts.</p>
<p>One imagines how different it could have been if Roman rule had been able to unwind more gradually, with less rage and violence on the part of the conquerors. Had things worked out otherwise, people might have been reading Ovid and Seneca in Pons Aelius (Newcastle) in the 6th century or taking hot baths under Doric arches in Durocornovium (Swindon) in the reign of King Offa of Mercia in the 8th century; there would have been no Dark Ages and no thousand-year wait for a Renaissance. Christianity might not have needed to impose itself with such savagery. In Rome, there would have been no impulse to smash up the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the middle of the Forum, and then crudely insert a church inside it and call it progress.</p>
<p>The melancholic feel sorry for all that has been lost. They can daydream about how different the Americas would have been if that fierce Spanish adventurer Hernán Cortés had been shipwrecked off Cuba in the late summer of 1519 and had not had the chance to butcher his way to the capital of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan. A city of gardens and lakes, it was home to up to 400,000 inhabitants, the largest conurbation in the world at that time, and one of its most educated and decorous, filled with botanical gardens, arenas for playing ullamaliztli games, ordered residential districts and bustling markets selling slabs of dark chocolate, sweet cornbread, multicoloured parrots and the skins of jaguars. One wishes that this civilisation had managed to spend longer undisturbed under the rule of Emperor Moctezuma and his heirs, and so would have been able to acquire the horses, steel swords and biological immunity required to meet the West on its terms. Tenochtitlan might now be one of the great urban tapestries of the world, the Paris or Kyoto of Mesoamerica, its culture harmonised with modernity. It would be reachable by a fleet of advanced jetliners based at Etzalcualiztli International Airport that would have, painted on their tails (in a nostalgic throwback respected by modern Aztecs in the same way that an American might think of Abraham Lincoln), a rendering of Huitzilopochtli, father of the nation and god of war and the Sun.</p>
<p>One might likewise wish that the Nasrid dynasty that controlled the Emirate of Granada had not met such a definitive end in 1492; that Muhammad XII could have brokered a deal with Queen Isabella I of Castile and that this enlightened nation, administered from the intricately decorated chambers of the Alhambra Palace, could have continued to be a centre of learning, a home for multiple faiths and a centre for mathematics and poetry. One might no less wish that the Republic of Venice could have held out against the French in 1797 and, rather than becoming a quaint historical curiosity, could have remained a dynamic, independent city state, dedicated to business and the arts, the Singapore of the Adriatic. We can imagine its logo, the lion of St Mark, proudly emblazoned on the sides of its electric ships and online trading portals.</p>
<p>How much more interesting and less internally troubled the North American continent might have been if the European conquerors’ westward progress had been stopped by treaty at the Rocky Mountains, after which travellers would still now be entering the territory of the Shoshone and the Paiutes, the Navajo and the Apache. What a useful counter to American exceptionalism it would have been if there were a low-rise Goshute metropolis near where Salt Lake City now stands; if, in place of San Francisco, there might be the Pomo Indian capital of Kunula (named after their sacred coyote); and if, all over the West, fast food outlets served dishes based on acorns, pumpkin and the flesh of cactuses.</p>
<p>The melancholy mind appreciates that it isn’t the best, the cleverest or the most deserving who invariably win; it tends to be those most dedicated to slaughter, rule-bending and aggression – and (in many cases) those who have had the good fortune to live in a region with large tameable mammals to ride into battle and a 200-year head start in making gunpowder. Beneath a triumphalist narration of history, a far sadder idea emerges: that one can be noble and yet defeated. Also, and more hopefully, we may see that there can be such a thing as an honourable failure, a failure which demonstrates greater virtues of character than success, because it is founded on unusual reserves of honesty, imagination and tolerance. We have plenty to learn from some of the so-called ‘losers’ of history, not so much about realpolitik and power play, as about the sort of lives it might be truly civilised to lead.</p>
