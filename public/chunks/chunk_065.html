            <h2>Fifty &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Fifty is plainly and soberly the age of melancholy. Until then, rumours of decline could be warded off. In certain circumstances, we could even have been able to pass as youthful. With carefully chosen clothes and an up-to-date knowledge of music, we might not have stood out in a group of thirty-five-year-olds. If we had hazarded a self-regarding joke about advancing decrepitude, we might have been told to stop exaggerating and – as had been the intention all along – received reassurance and comfort. Now, the mention of our age prompts a visible wince from anyone more than five years below it. Fifty is no longer a jest or a cute dramatisation: this is the start of our old age.</p>
<p>An intimate knowledge of how fast it has gone since forty adds to the panic. A few more decades and there will be colostomy bags and wheelchairs. We may feel young inside, but our hands insist otherwise: they are the hands of old people. What we call a horrible picture of ourselves today will be one we will feel proud of in three years’ time. ‘Horrible pictures’ are just a form of time travel; they are me-from-the-future sneaking in a visit.</p>
<p>By now, others will have started to die. Not the odd tragic one, as in our twenties, but constant cases. We start to scan obituaries.</p>
<p>Inevitably, there is a sexual component to our melancholy. We retreat in shame, knowing how sickening we must appear to so many. The thought of us as a sexual being fills most people with embarrassment. It feels like being desired by an elderly relative. It seems wholly against nature. We become, as a result of shame, highly formal, even distant. Younger people may think us unfriendly and verging on cold; we just want to be sure they know we haven’t noticed them. They might declare us ‘lovely’ or ‘sweet’, the way one refers to a harmless pet.</p>
<p>We have, by this stage, accumulated a density of experience. Late at night, falling asleep, random images may come to mind – unbidden – of different sections of our lives: the desks at primary school, the first room at university, that little hotel in Paris, the trip to Los Angeles, the night in the Chinese restaurant, the light at dawn on the coast shortly after the birth. We have lived through so much that we may feel, at times, a thousand years old.</p>
<p>Luckily, by fifty, we are more capable of gratitude. We know for sure that it won’t go on forever, and so we’re prepared not to scoff at much that we might previously have ignored on the way to greater things. We’ve been through a sufficient number of panics and dramas to appreciate a quiet day. We’ve met enough people, and fear their complexity sufficiently, to be content on our own. Simultaneously, we are a bit less interested in ourselves. We know how much about us will never change and how much we have messed up. In compensation, odd periods of history start to fascinate us – other countries too. We wash away our egoism in a broader stream. Perhaps it doesn’t matter quite so much what happens to our name and reputation. Success is a chimera; all it buys is momentary admiration, when what counts is connection and closeness, times when the usual bravery can be sloughed off, and we can admit how difficult it all is and how sad we are. Enough grandstanding and pretence; the only people who still interest us are the kind ones, who have suffered and know how to use their pain to connect with others.</p>
<p>We may grow increasingly moved by young children. Our own bigger offspring are brooding somewhere upstairs; they despise us now. But in the park, when we see a little one advancing happily towards its mother, in that drunken teetering way they have, we know exactly what it would feel like to pick them up; we remember their weight – that peculiar lightness that the human race has for a while – and long for the simplicity of this phase, when there wasn’t quite so much resentment and we could be a hero for suggesting some dancing or an ice cream.</p>
<p>At fifty, we are at the top of the long slide down to death. For a few more years, we can stand upright, but soon enough our backs will stiffen, our knees will give way (they let out odd noises already) and it will be hard to put on socks. Still, we can’t complain of an injustice or report the matter to the authorities. This is what happens to all of us. It’s in the contract we signed at birth; it’s not an outrage or a mistake, though that is exactly what it feels like.</p>
<p>The only way out is to wear our despair lightly, to turn it into a dark joke. It’s too late to make big changes, but we can learn to carry our mediocrity with as much dignity as possible, to rediscover modesty and exit a range of situations we should no longer be in. We should settle into the mood most suited to our age; we should learn to live under the sign of Saturn, in a spirit of benign, ego-less melancholy.</p>
