            <h2>10.The Pleasure of the Flight</h2>
<p>It’s strange, being up here, pressed against the window. To the side, a pair of engines, their immense labours concealed within their gently rounded casing. In modest lettering they announce their limited, but precise demands: that we avoid walking on the wing from which they are suspended and that we do not attempt to pour anything other than oil into their small apertures. Later they will be tended by a team of engineers, currently sleeping, in a service hanger on another continent.</p>
<p>In the cabin, there is not much talk about the clouds that are visible up here. No one thinks it remarkable that somewhere above an ocean we flew past a vast white candy-floss island which would have made a perfect seat for an angel or even God himself in a painting by Piero della Francesca. No one leaps to their feet to announce with requisite emphasis that, out of the window, we are flying over a cloud, a matter that would have amazed Leonardo and Poussin, Claude and Constable.</p>
<p>The world feels large and we very small – and the contrast is delightful. On this scale, the actions and concerns of our own lives don’t really count for much. We’re beautifully reminded of our own thorough unimportance.</p>
<p>Across history, people have imagined their gods living on lofty mountaintops or in the sky, looking down benignly on human life. It’s not a random association: from this height we can smile gently at humanity and perhaps love it a little, too. Even the grimmer areas of urban sprawl look serene and beautifully organised: the eastern suburbs of Glasgow nestle among wide tracts of farmland; microscopic lorries work their way placidly towards the docks of Hamburg along elegant ribbons of autobahn.</p>
<p>The view helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home. Their faults drop away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We want to be patient and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We’d like to tell them in franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them.</p>
<p>Lunch arrives; we spear a tiny roasted potato or a small piece of fish and prise the foil top off a squat carton of orange juice as we pass over a region where, four miles below on the ground, we would need to travel in an armed convoy. Later we pad along the aisle to explore the lavatory, wearing the shapeless socks the airline has provided. Perhaps at this moment a team of climbers are encamped below the summit of a ferocious mountain, bracing themselves for a final assault on the ice walls and overhangs – while we carefully dry our hands and think of watching a comedy on our seat-back screen.</p>
<p>The physical world – against which our ancestors struggled – has been tamed; our little tube of alloy and glass slips calmly over the forests, deserts and oceans that thwarted and terrified them.</p>
<p>As we start the descent, helped by the complex manoeuvres of the plane through the lower atmosphere, we dream of becoming the people we long to be. We’ll be energetic but thoughtful; sensitive but adventurous; we’ll eat modestly, appreciate our circumstances and remain committed to doing our best with the time that remains to us.</p>
