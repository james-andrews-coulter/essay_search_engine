        <h3>How to Find the Right Words</h3>
<p>A guide to delivering life's most awkward messages</p>
<p>Twenty case studies explaining how to gently deliver a range of life’s most difficult messages while causing minimal harm.</p>
<p>Life constantly requires us to give other people some hugely awkward messages: that we don’t love them any more; that we do love them (though we’re not meant to); that they smell a bit; that they’re fired; that we’re furious with them (though we adore them); or that their music is too loud ...</p>
<p>Often, out of embarrassment, we just stay quiet. Occasionally, we explode. And, typically, we stumble about, looking for the right words – dreading that we didn’t find them and thereby causing more hurt than we should. This is a book to help us locate the best possible words to get across a range of life’s most diﬃcult messages. In twenty case studies, we are gently shown what we might – in an ideal world – find ourselves saying to make our intentions known while causing minimal harm.</p>
<p>We laugh, we recognise our troubles – and we’re introduced to a range of deeply empathetic ways to navigate some of our most acute social dilemmas.</p>
