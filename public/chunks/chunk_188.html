            <h2>3. Animals grazing grasses</h2>
<ol>
<li>Built-up areas</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first stage in identifying habitats. It sounds obvious, and it is, but there is an important distinction between seeing a sheep and understanding a sheep’s
  place in the scheme of things. The person whose thought process stops with the less-than-dramatic thought, ‘There is a sheep and some trees’, has clearly not made the same connection
  with their surroundings as the person who thinks: ‘There is a sheep; it is a herbivore and likes to live in a flock; there are likely to be lots more. There they are. I wonder why there is a
  small copse of young trees in the middle of their grassy field? Oh I see now, there is a fence around it stopping the sheep grazing there and killing the saplings . . . But, I wonder why the farmer
  fenced this area off in the first place . . .’</p>
<p>Once we are used to seeing the landscape as a series of habitats, we can begin to ask and answer more interesting questions. And we will find a large number of the answers by
  thinking about water and rocks.</p>
<p>First we need to clear up a big misconception. There is a temptation to think of places as being different because they are in different places. The Lake District is like the Lake District
  because it is . . . the Lake District. Yosemite National Park is like Yosemite National Park because it is Yosemite National Park. Beneath the ludicrousness of these statements lurks something big
  and key.</p>
<p>Rocks and water explain a lot about every natural environment, regardless of where they are. Time for our final set of building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All land is based on rocks of some kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some rocks, like chalk, are porous and some, like slate, are non-porous. Non-porous rocks hold water above them and lead to wet areas. Porous rocks let the water filter
      down through them and lead to dry areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some plants and animals like wet conditions and some like drier conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some rocks, like granite, lead to soil above them that is acidic and some, like chalk, form soil that is alkaline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most plants prefer alkaline conditions, so you get more plants and more diverse plants growing in areas with alkaline soils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rivers carve V-shaped valleys and meander, creating interlocking spurs that result in restricted views. During the last ice age, on the other hand, glaciers carved big,
      wide U-shaped valleys with great views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the sea meets land, the wind creates waves and constant erosion. Depending on the rocks it acts upon, this process gives us beaches, cliffs and many more
      beguiling landforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The side of a landmass closest to the sea, in the direction the wind comes from, will get most of the rain. The weather in the UK arrives from the west: Wales is a lot
      wetter than East Anglia, which is on average 34 per cent drier than the rest of England and Wales.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Granted, that’s quite a few building blocks, but by using them you can not only understand habitats, but you can predict the things you will find in them. This is because
  once you are aware of these very broad characteristics – acid or alkaline, wet or dry, river or glacier country – then suddenly the green chaos starts to organize itself before your
  eyes.</p>
<p>The habits of some familiar animals and plants are well known to us. For instance, most people know that cows are rarely found in the middle of the woods, but that shade-loving fungi thrive
  there.</p>
<p>Quite quickly, we can appreciate that every single animal and plant is an ‘indicator’ of some sort; it is trying to tell us something about the environment. Frogs and dragonflies
  live in still, freshwater habitats, so you will not find them far from lakes and ponds. Some plants, like heather, love direct sunlight, so you will tend to find them on south-facing slopes. Once
  we add all these indicators together we form a beautifully intricate picture of the place where we find ourselves. And the reason we find ourselves there is not usually a coincidence; it is
  connected to the landscape’s intricacy.</p>
<p>The Lake District in the UK is a popular destination, and its many visitors go there not because it is conveniently situated, but – indirectly – because it is comprised of a lot of
  non-porous rocks and has been shaped by glaciers. The glacial ice formed big U-shaped valleys, and the water that collects in these valleys can’t get down through the rocks at the bottom and
  so collects to form picturesque lakes. The poetry of Wordsworth, Coleridge and hundreds of others has been inspired by the Lake District’s dramatic views, and these have been sculpted by
  rocks, ice and water.</p>
<p>Granite creates acidic soils and is non-porous, so we find wet inhospitable conditions above granite. Mosses are one of the few plants that can thrive in such conditions, and over many years the
  mosses are compressed down to form peat. So, granite creates a boggy, peaty wilderness we have come to call a moor. Dartmoor is the way it is because of the granite below the surface.</p>
<p>The sorts of habitats we are likely to encounter are:</p>
<p>• Grasslands</p>
<p>• Shrublands</p>
<p>• Woodlands</p>
<p>• Wetlands</p>
<p>• Coastal</p>
<p>• Rocky</p>
<p>• Artificial – from farmland to urban</p>
<p>Within each of these, the rock below the surface and the actions of the water on that rock will create more specific types of habitat. Limestone will support deciduous forests,
  while sandy soils often lie under pine forests.</p>
<p>The reward for recognizing habitats is that this makes the next stage in connecting with nature much more straightforward. Habitats are like large houses with several extended families living in
  them. We know that when we go to visit Aunt Jane, there is a high probability that we will also see Uncle John. And so it is with wild habitats: if we are on a chalk hill we can expect to see beech
  trees, which love alkaline conditions and dry soils, but we should not expect to see many alder trees, which hate dry soil and love their roots to be surrounded by water.</p>
<p>Soon the tangled masses we once saw are revealed as part of a simple system. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, we see order; the plants and animals not only sort themselves into easy-to-understand
  groups, but allow us to have a lot of fun in making predictions and doing detective work.</p>
<p>Exercise 13</p>
<p>Now it is your turn. Think back to the field with the sheep and the fenced-off young trees. After a squint through the train’s window you notice that the field is
      lined with beech trees, but the fenced-off trees in the middle are alders. Use the information in this chapter to predict one flying creature you might encounter, if you walked from the edge to
      the centre of the field in summer.</p>
<p>Answer: The alders in the centre of the field hint that there is water there. The farmer has probably fenced off a pond to keep livestock safely out of it. This has also kept the grazing
      sheep away from the vulnerable saplings and allowed the young alders to thrive. You might encounter a number of flying insects in these conditions, but the one hinted at earlier in this chapter
      was dragonflies.</p>
<p>The sheep explain the landscape. The chalk explains the beech trees, but the alders hint at a different microhabitat, and this in turn suggests the animals we might encounter. The network is
      slowly building.</p>
