            <h3>Love life</h3>
<p>Failure is a cleansing agent for relationships. It is ruthless with all but the most solid bonds; it gets rid of all but the most sincere. Failure works out what love is worth keeping – and ensures that other varieties are extinguished in short order. It won’t tolerate simulacrums of love – the flattery that can pass for it, or the sentimental attachment or unfocused crush.</p>
<p>There are plenty of apparently viable unions that can, in benevolent times, go on forever – out of habit, a longing for security or a fear of what the neighbours would think. But once there is shocking failure – once the neighbours are mocking anyway, once our craving for tenderness reaches a pitch, once we lose any hesitation about asking for hugs and caresses, once we are crying like small children and don’t mind saying what is actually on our minds – we quickly see which love is worth preserving and which never merited the name in the first place.</p>
<p>The partner who might have stayed with us out of convenience or because – for a long time – we were a handy route to money and status, will hardly make a protest (or only a tiny one, in order to preserve their own dignity). They will let us go soon enough; they never signed up to a mess, they never thought they would be asked to care without much hope of reward (except for thoughtful gratitude). They understood love as being with someone who could shore them up and make them feel better. It wasn’t about nailing themselves to a loser.</p>
<p>It would be better to keep such criteria in mind from the beginning of any future dating process. We should ask ourselves: is this a person who would stay by me when everyone else is laughing, who wouldn’t run away if I had no more money, who would stick around if I had enemies or was driven off to jail …? These are not normal questions to wonder about on a first date – we’re meant to look into their eyes and wonder about their job prospects – but they are the qualities we should turn over in our minds given the role of fate and the presence of our hamartia. We are not looking for dumb or uncritical loyalty; what we aspire to is a sort of love that recognises us in our totality and respects the workings of fortune – and is therefore slower to judge or to flee.</p>
<p>In honour of these concerns, we might, on a future date, ask our partner: ‘And how might you feel about waiting for me until I end a prison term?’ Most would immediately look horrified and run away. A few will smile and utter a gentle ‘but of course’ – and we’ll know then never to let them go.</p>
<p>The solace that these types of people can bring us is beyond compare. When failure strikes, they will compensate for the love of the whole world. One person’s close and attentive ministration can truly make up for the unsteady adulation and eventual cruel condemnation of millions. It won’t matter very much at all that we are ridiculed by strangers, if we are taken seriously by the one person we esteem in our own home. We’ll know exactly what Shakespeare meant in his ‘Sonnet 29’, even if not every word makes it through from his Elizabethan English to our own:</p>
<p>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,</p>
<p>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</p>
<p>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</p>
<p>And look upon myself and curse my fate,</p>
<p>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</p>
<p>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</p>
<p>Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,</p>
<p>With what I most enjoy contented least;</p>
<p>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,</p>
<p>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</p>
<p>(Like to the lark at break of day arising</p>
<p>From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;</p>
<p>For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings</p>
<p>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>
<p>With this very particular sort of lover in our lives, the sort that would wait outside the prison gates for us, we’ll finally be in a position to understand love. We’ll know that kings – or more realistically, celebrities and tech millionaires – don’t have anything on us and that, despite the mess we have made of our lives, we are the luckiest people on the Earth.</p>
