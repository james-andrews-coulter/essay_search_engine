        <h3>— Acknowledge our psychological compulsions</h3>
<p>It is imperative that we allow ourselves to pore over our own histories. The errors we are guilty of have not come from nowhere; we are enmeshed in complicated psychological dynamics that drove them forward. Long ago, we were perhaps bequeathed the legacy of having to please a distant or depressed parent; or we felt invisible and therefore recklessly driven to make exaggerated impressions on strangers; or perhaps our minds were such uncomfortable places to dwell in that we had to find relief in illegal substances or activities.</p>
<p>Knowing where we came from and how we ended up transgressing doesn’t in any way excuse us, but it adds context that diminishes suicidal impulses and helps us to face up to our reality. We aren’t just brutes or fools; we are wounded and have been for a long time. There will be reasons why we acted as we did – and in a certain mood, we can see the logic of our illness and feel sorry that it should have had such a powerful grip on us.</p>
<p>Unlike what is routinely assumed, we can both take responsibility for our actions and have a measure of broad-minded sympathy for why we perpetrated them. We’re not asking to be let off – but we can hope to be understood.</p>
