            <h3>2 No one knows what’s attractive anyway</h3>
<p>The ugliness of the modern world rests on a second intellectual error: the idea that no one knows what is attractive in architecture. In the pre-modern world, it was widely assumed that there were precise rules about what made buildings pleasing. In the West, those rules were codified in a doctrine known as ‘Classicism’. Created by the Greeks and developed by the Romans, Classicism defined what elegant buildings should look like for more than 1,500 years. Recognisably classical forms were present all over the West, from Edinburgh to Charleston, Bordeaux to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Rotunda, University of Virginia, 1826.</p>
<p>Gradually, polite disagreement broke out. Some people made a case for other styles; for example, for the Gothic way of building from the Middle Ages. Others argued for Islamic architecture, or for Chinese, Alpine or Thai styles. A diversity of buildings appeared around the West along with debates about how it might be best to build.</p>
<p>In time, the debates were resolved in a way that was intellectually respectful but that provoked some very bad practical consequences. It was decreed that, in matters of visual taste, no one could really win the argument. All tastes deserved a hearing. There was no such thing as an objective standard. Attractiveness in architecture was evidently a multifaceted and subjective phenomenon.</p>
<p>Once again, this was music to property developers’ ears. Suddenly, no one would be allowed to describe a building as ‘ugly’. After all, taste was merely subjective. You and your friends might dislike a new district, a democratic majority might even loathe it, but that was only a personal judgement, not an edict one had to heed. Cities grew ever uglier, but no one was allowed to say that there was such a thing as ‘ugliness’. After all, isn’t taste just personal?</p>
