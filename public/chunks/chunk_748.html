        <h2>I : Challenge</h2>
<p>For a long time, we may cope well enough. We make it to work every morning, we give pleasant summaries of our lives to friends, we smile over dinner. We aren’t totally balanced, but there’s no good way of knowing how difficult things might be for other people, and what we might have a right to expect in terms of contentment and peace of mind. We probably tell ourselves to stop being self-indulgent and redouble our efforts to feel worthy through achievement. We are probably world experts in not feeling sorry for ourselves.</p>
<p>Decades may pass. It’s not uncommon for the most serious mental conditions to remain undiagnosed for half a lifetime. We simply don’t notice that we are, beneath the surface, chronically anxious, filled with self-loathing, and close to overwhelming despair and rage. This too simply ends up feeling normal.</p>
<p>Until one day, finally, something triggers a collapse. It might be a crisis at work, a reversal in our career plans or a mistake we’ve made over a task. It might be a romantic failure, someone leaving us, or a realization that we are profoundly unhappy with a partner we had thought would be our long-term future. Alternatively, we feel mysteriously exhausted and sad, to the extent that we can’t face anything any more, even a family meal or a conversation with a friend. Or we are struck by unmanageable anxiety around everyday challenges, like addressing our colleagues or going into a store. We’re swamped by a sense of doom and imminent catastrophe. We sob uncontrollably.</p>
<p>We are in a mental crisis.</p>
<p>This is what might come next . . .</p>
<p>1 Breakdown</p>
<p>If we are lucky, when it feels impossible to carry on any longer we will know to put up the white flag at once. There is nothing shameful or rare in our condition; we have fallen ill, as so many before us have. We need not compound our sickness with a sense of embarrassment. This is what happens when you are a delicate human facing the hurtful, alarming and always uncertain conditions of existence. Recovery can start the moment we admit we no longer have a clue how to cope.</p>
<p>The roots of the crisis almost certainly go back a long way. Things will have not been right in certain areas for an age, possibly for ever. There will have been grave inadequacies in the early days, things that were said and done to us that should never have been, and bits of reassurance and care that were ominously missed out. In addition to this, adult life will have layered on difficulties which we were not well equipped to know how to endure. It will have applied pressure along our most tender, invisible fault lines.</p>
<p>Our illness is trying to draw attention to our problems, but it can only do so inarticulately, by throwing up coarse and vague symptoms. It knows how to signal that we are worried and sad, but it can’t tell us what about and why. That will be the work of patient investigation, over months and years, probably in the company of experts. The illness contains the cure, but it has to be teased out and its original inarticulacy interpreted. Something from the past is crying out to be recognized and will not leave us alone until we have given it its due.</p>
<p>It may seem—at points—like death sentence but we are, beneath the crisis, being given an opportunity to restart our lives on a more generous, kind, and realistic footing. There is an art to being ill—and to daring at last to listen to what our pain is trying to tell us.</p>
<p>Mental health is a miracle we are apt not to notice until the moment it slips from our grasp—at which point we may wonder how we ever managed to do anything as complicated and beautiful as order our thoughts sanely and calmly.</p>
<p>A mind in a healthy state is, in the background, continually performing a near-miraculous set of maneuvers that underpin our moods of clear-sightedness and purpose. To appreciate what mental health involves—and therefore what makes up its opposite—we should take a moment to consider some of what will be happening in the folds of an optimally functioning mind:</p>
<p>First and foremost, a healthy mind is an editing mind, an organ that manages to sieve, from thousands of stray, dramatic, disconcerting, or horrifying thoughts, those particular ideas and sensations that actively need to be entertained in order for us to direct our lives effectively.</p>
<p>Partly this means keeping at bay punitive and critical judgments that might want to tell us repeatedly how disgraceful and appalling we are—long after harshness has ceased to serve any useful purpose. When we are interviewing for a new job or taking someone on a date, a healthy mind doesn’t force us to listen to inner voices that insist on our unworthiness. It allows us to talk to ourselves as we would to a friend.</p>
<p>At the same time, a healthy mind resists the pull of unfair comparisons. It doesn’t constantly allow the achievements and successes of others to throw us off course and reduce us to a state of bitter inadequacy. It doesn’t torture us by continually comparing our condition to that of people who have, in reality, had very different upbringings and trajectories through life. A well-functioning mind recognizes the futility and cruelty of constantly finding fault with its own nature.</p>
<p>Along the way, a healthy mind keeps a judicious grip on the drip, drip, drip of fear. It knows that, in theory, there is an endless number of things that we could worry about: A blood vessel might fail, a scandal might erupt, the plane’s engines could sheer from its wings . . . But it has a good sense of the distinction between what could conceivably happen and what is in fact likely to happen, and so it is able to leave us in peace as regards the wilder eventualities of fate, confident that awful things will either not unfold or could be dealt with ably enough if ever they did so. A healthy mind avoids catastrophic imaginings: It knows that there are broad and stable stone steps, not a steep and slippery incline, between itself and disaster.</p>
<p>A healthy mind has compartments with heavy doors that shut securely. It can compartmentalize where it needs to. Not all thoughts belong at all moments. While talking to a grandmother, the mind prevents the emergence of images of last night’s erotic fantasies; while looking after a child, it can repress its more cynical and misanthropic analyses. Aberrant thoughts about jumping on a train line or harming yourself with a sharp knife can remain brief peculiar flashes rather than repetitive fixations. A healthy mind has mastered the techniques of censorship.</p>
<p>A healthy mind can quieten its own buzzing preoccupations in order, at times, to focus on the world beyond itself. It can be present and engaged with what and who is immediately around. Not everything it could feel has to be felt at every moment.</p>
<p>A healthy mind combines an appropriate suspicion of certain people with a fundamental trust in humanity. It can take an intelligent risk with a stranger. It doesn’t extrapolate from life’s worst moments in order to destroy the possibility of connection.</p>
<p>A healthy mind knows how to hope; it identifies and then hangs on tenaciously to a few reasons to keep going. Grounds for despair, anger, and sadness are, of course, all around. But the healthy mind knows how to bracket negativity in the name of endurance. It clings to evidence of what is still good and kind. It remembers to appreciate; it can—despite everything—still look forward to a hot bath, some dried fruit or dark chocolate, a chat with a friend, or a satisfying day of work. It refuses to let itself be silenced by all the many sensible arguments in favor of rage and despondency.</p>
<p>Outlining some of the features of a healthy mind helps us to identify what can go awry when we fall ill. At the heart of mental illness is a loss of control over our own better thoughts and feelings. An unwell mind can’t apply a filter to the information that reaches our awareness; it can no longer order or sequence its content. And from this, any number of painful scenarios ensue:</p>
<p>Ideas keep coming to the fore that serve no purpose, unkind voices echo ceaselessly. Worrying possibilities press on us all at once, without any bearing on the probability of their occurrence. Fear runs riot.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, regrets drown out any capacity to make our peace with who we are. Every bad thing we have ever said or done reverberates and cripples our self-esteem. We are unable to assign correct proportions to anything: A drawer that doesn’t open feels like a conclusive sign that we are doomed; a slightly unfriendly remark by an acquaintance becomes proof that we shouldn’t exist. We can’t grade our worries and focus in on the few that might truly deserve concern.</p>
<p>We can’t temper our sadness. We can’t overcome the idea that we have not been loved properly, that we have made a mess of the whole of our working lives, that we have disappointed everyone who ever had a shred of faith in us.</p>
<p>Every compartment of the mind is blown open. The strangest, most extreme thoughts run unchecked across consciousness. We begin to fear that we might shout obscenities in public or do harm with the kitchen knives.</p>
<p>In the worst cases, we lose the power to distinguish outer reality from our inner world. We can’t tell what is outside us and what inside, where we end and others begin; we speak to people as if they were actors in our own dreams.</p>
<p>At night, such is the maelstrom and the ensuing exhaustion that we become defenseless before our worst apprehensions. By 3 a.m., after hours of rumination, doing away with ourselves no longer feels like such a remote or unwelcome notion.</p>
<p>However dreadful this sounds, it is a paradox that, for the most part, mental illness doesn’t tend to look from the outside as dramatic as we think it should. The majority of us, when we are mentally unwell, will not be foaming at the mouth or insisting that we are Napoleon. We won’t be making speeches about alien invasions or declaring that we control space and time. Our suffering will be quieter, more inward, more concealed, and more contiguous with societal norms; we’ll sob mutely into the pillow or dig our nails silently into our palms. Others may not even realize for a very long time, if ever, that we are in difficulty. We ourselves may not quite accept the scale of our sickness.</p>
<p>The clichéd images of “madness”—with their obscenities, ravings, and bombast—may be frightening in themselves, but our collective focus on them suggests a concealed search for reassurance. We depict mental illness in colorful and extreme terms to convince ourselves of our own sanity; to put some clear blue water between our own fragile states and those of people we dismissively term “lunatics.” We thereby fail to acknowledge the extent to which mental illness is ultimately as common, and as essentially unshameful, as its bodily counterpart—and also comprises a host of more minor ailments, the equivalents of cold sores and broken wrists, abdominal cramps or ingrowing toenails.</p>
<p>When we define mental illness as a loss of command over the mind, few of us can claim to be free of all instances of unwellness. True mental health involves a frank acceptance of how much ill health there will have to be in even the most ostensibly competent and meaningful lives. There will be days when we simply can’t stop crying over someone we have lost. Or when we worry so much about the future that we wish we hadn’t been born. Or when we feel so sad that it seems futile even to open our mouths. We should at such times be counted as no less ill than a person laid up in bed with flu—and as worthy of attention and sympathy.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that we are at least a hundred years away from properly fathoming how the brain operates—and how it might be healed. We are in the mental arena roughly equivalent to where we might have been in bodily medicine around the middle of the seventeenth century, as we slowly built up a picture of how blood circulated around our veins or our kidneys functioned. In our attempts to find fixes, we are akin to those surgeons depicted in early prints who cut up cadavers with rusty scissors and clumsily dug around the innards with a poker. We will—surprisingly—be well on the way to colonizing Mars before we definitively grasp the secrets to the workings of our own minds.</p>
<p>It is surely no coincidence that in many parts of Europe, asylums for the mentally ill were, from the Renaissance onward, opened up in converted monasteries, signaling an implicit connection between the solace sought from religion and from psychiatry. The best of these asylums, and there were very few, promised a dignified refuge from the pressures of society and the terrors of the mind. They may have had extensive gardens, most famously like the one at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy, where an ailing Vincent Van Gogh spent a year in 1889, sitting very still in his room for hours at a time and then painting dozens of sublime canvases of irises, cypresses, and pine trees, paintings that may to this day help persuade the inconsolable to keep living.</p>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh, The Garden of the Asylum at Saint-Rémy, May 1889, 1889.</p>
<p>In its way, this book aims to be a sanctuary, a walled garden filled with nourishing psychological vegetation and with comfortable benches on which to sit and recover our strength, in an atmosphere of kindness and fellow feeling. It outlines a raft of therapeutic moves with which we might approach our most stubborn mental afflictions and instabilities. It sets out to be a friend through some of the most difficult moments of our lives.</p>
