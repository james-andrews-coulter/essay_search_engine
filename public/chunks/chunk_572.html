            <h3>¶ Confidence in Confidence</h3>
<p>Although we assume that we must want to be confident, in our hearts, we may harbour suspicions that confidence is in fact an unappealing state of mind. Without fully realising it, we might find the idea of being truly confident strangely offensive, and secretly remain attached to hesitancy and modesty.</p>
<p>Suspicion of confidence has traditionally enjoyed immense cultural endorsement. Christianity – for centuries the greatest influence on the mindset of the West – was highly sceptical about those who think too well of themselves. While the meek basked in divine favour, the arrogant would be the last to enter the kingdom of heaven. The political theory of Karl Marx added to this argument a set of ideas apparently proving that economic success was founded upon the exploitation of others. No wonder it may feel as if – to be moral citizens – we should steer clear of all overly robust assertions of our own interests.</p>
<p>Yet this attitude too can carry dangers. We may lack the confidence not to be cruel and promote greed, but to fight for kindness and wisdom. Our lack of confidence in confidence may be allowing degraded versions of self-assertion to thrive.</p>
<p>Maybe we are just being unfair. Our negative view of confidence can be overly dependent on the quirks of our own histories, or on the sort of people in whom we first encountered confidence, who were not its best or most reliable representatives. Our real problem may not be confidence so much as a lack of other virtues such as manners, charm, wit and generosity. We may be wrongly diagnosing the root of our objections. There may be a danger of growing into braggarts, self-seekers and blowhards. But confidence is in its essence compatible with remaining sensitive, kind, witty and softly spoken. It might be brutishness, not confidence, that we hate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our attraction to meekness may mask some rather cowardly resentments against self-assertion. We might not so much admire timidity as fear giving confidence a try. It was this species of self-protective deception that particularly fascinated Nietzsche. He thought it a typical error of many Christians, who might pride themselves on their ‘forgiveness’ while simply trying to excuse their ‘inability to take revenge’. We should take care not to dress up our base deficiencies as godly virtues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t enough to be kind, interesting, intelligent and wise inside: we need to develop the skill that allows us to make our talents active in the world at large. Confidence is what translates theory into practice. It should never be thought of as the enemy of good things; it is their crucial and legitimate catalyst. We should allow ourselves to develop confidence in confidence.</p>
