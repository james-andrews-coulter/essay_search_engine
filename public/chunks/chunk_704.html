            <h3>¶ Wisdom</h3>
<p>To teach us how to be wise is the underlying central purpose of philosophy. The word may sound abstract and lofty, but wisdom is something we might plausibly aim to acquire a little more of over the course of our lives, even if true wisdom requires that we always keep in mind the persistent risk of madness and error.</p>
<p>Wisdom can be said to comprise twelve ingredients:</p>
<p>Realism</p>
<p>The wise are, first and foremost, ‘realistic’ about how challenging many things can be. They are fully conscious of the complexities entailed in any project: raising a child, starting a business, spending an agreeable weekend with the family, changing the nation, falling in love … Knowing that something difficult is being attempted doesn’t rob the wise of ambition, but it makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic about the problems that will invariably come their way. The wise rarely expect anything to be wholly easy or to go entirely well.</p>
<p>Gratitude</p>
<p>Properly aware that much can and will go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty, even extremely modest ones, of the kind that those with grander plans rush past. With the dangers and tragedies of existence firmly in mind, they can take pleasure in a single, uneventful, sunny day, or some pretty flowers growing by a brick wall, the charm of a three-year-old playing in a garden, or an evening of intimate conversation among friends. It isn’t that they are sentimental and naive, but precisely the opposite: they have seen how hard things can get, and they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and the sweet – whenever and wherever these arise.</p>
<p>Folly</p>
<p>The wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are never far from folly: they have irrational desires and incompatible aims; they are unaware of much of what they feel; they are prone to mood swings; they are visited by powerful fantasies and delusions; they are buffeted by the curious demands of their sexuality. The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing co-existence of deep immaturity and perversity alongside quite adult qualities such as intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes. Aware that at least half of life is irrational, they try wherever possible to budget for madness and are slow to panic when it (reliably) rears its head.</p>
<p>Humour</p>
<p>The wise take seriously the business of laughing at themselves. They hedge their pronouncements and are sceptical in their conclusions. Their certainties are not as brittle as those of others. They laugh due to the constant collisions between the noble way they would like things to be and the demented way they often turn out.</p>
<p>Politeness</p>
<p>The wise are realistic about social relations – in particular, about how difficult it is to change people’s minds and have an effect on their lives. They are therefore extremely reticent about telling others too frankly what they think. They have a sense of how seldom it is useful to get censorious with others. Above all, they want things to be nice in social settings, even if this means they are not totally authentic. They will sit with someone of an opposite political persuasion and not try to convert them; they will hold their tongue at someone who seems to be announcing a wrong-headed plan for reforming the country, educating their child or directing their personal life. They’ll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others and will search more for what people have in common than what separates them.</p>
<p>Self-acceptance</p>
<p>The wise have made their peace with the yawning gap between how they ideally want to be and what they are actually like. They have come to terms with their tendencies to idiocy, ugliness and error. They are not fundamentally ashamed of themselves because they have already shed so much of their pride.</p>
<p>Forgiveness</p>
<p>The wise are comparably realistic about other people. They recognise the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests and seek their own pleasures. It can make others appear extremely ‘mean’ and purposefully evil, but this would be to over-personalise the issue. The wise know that most hurt is unintentional – it’s a by-product of the constant collision of competing egos in a world of scarce resources.</p>
<p>The wise are therefore slow to anger and judgement. They don’t leap to the worst conclusions about what is going on in the minds of others. They will be readier to overlook a hurt from a proper sense of how difficult every life is, harbouring as it does so many frustrated ambitions, disappointments and longings. The wise appreciate the pressures people are under. Of course they shouted, of course they were rude, naturally they want to appear as slightly more important than they are … The wise are generous in seeing the reasons why people might not be nice. They feel less persecuted by the aggression and meanness of others, because they have a sense of where it comes from: a place of hurt.</p>
<p>Resilience</p>
<p>The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know just how much can go wrong and yet things will still be (just about) liveable. The unwise person draws the boundaries of their contentment too far out, so that it encompasses, and depends upon, fame, money, personal relationships, popularity, health … The wise person sees the advantages of all of these, but also knows that they may – before too long, at a time of fate’s choosing – have to draw the borders right back and find contentment within a more bounded space.</p>
<p>Envy</p>
<p>The wise person doesn’t envy idly: they realise that there are some good reasons why they don’t have many of the things they really want. They look at the tycoon or the star and have a decent grasp of why they weren’t able to succeed at this level. It looks like an accident – an unfair one – but there were in fact some logical grounds.</p>
<p>At the same time, the wise see that some destinies are truly shaped by nothing more than accident. Some people are promoted randomly. Companies that aren’t especially deserving can suddenly make it big. Some people have the right parents. The winners aren’t all noble and good. The wise appreciate the role of luck and don’t curse themselves overly at those junctures where they have not had as much of it as they would have liked.</p>
<p>Success and Failure</p>
<p>The wise emerge as realistic about the consequences of winning and succeeding. They may want to win as much as the next person, but they are aware of how many fundamentals will remain unchanged whatever the outcome. They don’t exaggerate the transformations available to us. They know how much we remain tethered to some basic dynamics in our personalities, whatever job we have or whatever material possession we acquire. This is both cautionary (for those who succeed) and hopeful (for those who won’t). The wise see the continuities across those two categories over-emphasised by modern consumer capitalism: ‘success’ and ‘failure’.</p>
<p>Regrets</p>
<p>In our ambitious age, it is common to begin with dreams of being able to pull off an unblemished life, where one can hope to get the major decisions in love and work right.</p>
<p>But the wise realise that it is impossible to fashion a spotless life; everyone will make large and uncorrectable errors in a number of areas. Perfectionism is a wicked illusion. Regret is unavoidable.</p>
<p>But regret lessens the more we see that error is endemic across the species. One can’t look at anyone’s life story without seeing some devastating mistakes etched across it. These errors are not coincidental but structural; they arise because we all lack the information we need to make choices in time-sensitive situations. Where it counts, we are all steering almost blind.</p>
<p>Calm</p>
<p>The wise know that turmoil is always around the corner, and they have come to fear and sense its approach. That’s why they nurture such a strong commitment to calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement. A day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. They are not afraid of having a somewhat boring time. Things could be, and will be again, so much worse.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, the wise know that it will never be possible to be wise every hour, let alone every day, of their lives.</p>
