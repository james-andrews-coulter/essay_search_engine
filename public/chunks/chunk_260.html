        <h1>Dialogue</h1>
<p>The philosopher Martin Buber said, ‘All real living is meeting.’ He realized that only in relationships can we fully open ourselves to the world and to each other. Buber wrote that ‘genuine dialogue’, whether spoken or silent, occurs only when each of the participants really has in mind the other or others, in their ‘present and particular being and turns to them with the intention of establishing a living mutual relation between himself and them’. I would add that in order to meaningfully connect to another person, one has to be open. This means being not who we think we should be, but allowing ourselves to be who we really are. This usually involves risking feeling vulnerable. Being open, and therefore vulnerable, does not guarantee that we will connect with the other, but if we do not allow ourselves to feel vulnerable, we deny ourselves the opportunity to experience genuine dialogue.</p>
<p>Buber also describes two other ways of being with others. First is ‘technical dialogue’, which is prompted solely by the need for objective understanding. For example:</p>
<p>‘What sort of batteries do I need for this?’</p>
<p>‘You need size AAA batteries.’</p>
<p>Second, ‘monologue disguised as dialogue’, in which two people who think they are having a conversation are actually talking to themselves. Jane Austen captured this process brilliantly in Northanger Abbey:</p>
<p>[Mrs. Allen was] never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her gowns.</p>
