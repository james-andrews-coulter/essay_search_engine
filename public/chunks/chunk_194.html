            <h1>2. The Strengthening Cycle</h1>
<p>‘The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical. It is the sower of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger . . . is as good
      as dead.’</p>
<p>(ALBERT EINSTEIN)</p>
<p>So far, we have taken the following steps to reconnect with nature:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Applied new skills to the natural world, and tried doing new things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexed our senses and given them a workout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grown comfortable with landscapes, habitats and the broadest of nature’s brushstrokes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigated a few of the finer connections to be found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowed ourselves to be allured by conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciated the role of time in nature, and that we will never get a chance to witness anything in exactly the same way twice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stepped into the landscape and made ourselves part of the nature experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do not take the simple steps above, we are gambling a lot on there being another life like this one; if, on the other hand, we do take these steps, then a series of
  positive consequences follows. Changes occur in how we perceive things, how we think, how we feel and how we act. At this point, the subject becomes a willing object. Nature begins to change us.
  This positive change encourages us to invest more in the process. The cycle strengthens.</p>
<p>Growing numbers of studies are revealing simple correlations between our exposure to nature, or lack of it, and our wellbeing. Research in the US has shown that the more green
  spaces in a neighbourhood, the lower the average body mass index of the children who live there.</p>
<p>Many of the health impacts are less well understood, but this is changing. Patients recovering from surgery have been found to need one day less in hospital if trees can be seen from their
  window instead of just bricks. If pharmaceutical companies could put this effect in a pill, they would do so and they would make billions. But they can’t. Nature can’t be packaged or
  marketed easily; we cannot rely on others to sell us a solution.</p>
<p>A recent study has shown that people become more generous after they have seen pictures of nature. Academics like to measure generosity with a basic experimental test called the ‘dictator
  game’. It is very simple: person A is given a sum of money and asked if they would like to give any of it to person B. Studies have shown that if people are being watched, they become more
  generous, because that is how they wish to be perceived. This effect can even be achieved by putting an image of a pair of eyes on a wall. Amazingly, a picture of flowers has recently been shown to
  have an even greater impact on human generosity in these experiments than a pair of eyes.</p>
<p>Time spent in nature has been shown to improve self-esteem and conflict resolution. It also reduces absenteeism, and one hour spent in nature can improve memory and attention span by 20 per
  cent. Nature can calm us, it can help us focus and, for many, it works as an antidepressant. The author Richard Louv has made a convincing case for the power of time spent in nature to improve our
  relationships with family and friends. Just as families can bond over mutual interests in sport or work, nature can become a shared interest – but it has a particular advantage when it comes
  to forming bonds: time spent in nature takes us away from impatient and interrupting technology.</p>
<p>Both technology and nature have an allure, and we can find ourselves mesmerized by either. This means that we sometimes have to tug ourselves from one to the other, but once we make the shift
  there is little or no sense of loss. When we’re indoors, such mind-neutral activities as watching TV or checking social media can feel more enticing than putting on a coat and stepping
  outside. However, after ten minutes in the fresh air these electronic mind-traps lose any magnetism they may once have held.</p>
<p>Instead of castigating computer games as all bad, we might do better to accept that they obviously appeal very strongly to many people, especially the young, and look for lessons within that.
  One cool sunny October morning following a day of heavy rain, I knew it was a prime time for admiring autumnal fungi in our local woods, and I was very keen to share this with my young sons. They
  seemed distracted by a computer game at the time, so I decided to fight fire with fire by appealing to their sense of competition and scores. I told them that the record for the greatest number of
  fungus specimens I’d ever found in one walk was fourteen. We returned two hours later with big grins and a new top score. The boys ran up to their mum and proudly declared that they had found
  114 fungi, 100 more than Dad could find on his own. For me that morning also set a different top score: it was among my top ten life experiences to date.</p>
<p>Aside from the relatively easy-to-identify physiological and philosophical benefits, a connection with nature offers something bigger and more mysterious. When we stop to look at something and
  trace the connection between that organism and ourselves, we invest time in a form of contemplation.</p>
<p>You are walking on limestone hills and you stop to retie your shoelaces. A blister on one foot is rubbing against the sock. You notice beside your foot a plant called a prickly lettuce, and
  struggle, for fun, to remember the things you have read about it. And then its Latin name comes back to you, Lactuca serriola, because this is the plant with serrated edges, which lactates
  a milky sap if broken. You pause.</p>
<p>The prickly lettuce is absorbing the morning sun. Your eyes are drawn to the sun and it tinkers with your body-clock, making you feel more awake and energetic. The lettuce is thriving in the
  soil above the limestone. You are thriving by walking on the limestone hills. In a month the flower will be gone; soon you will have left that spot. When you return, the flower may not be there;
  even if it is, all will be different. The light, colours, scents and temperature will be different. Your feelings, levels of alertness and energy, thoughts, mood and memories will be different. The
  earth will have revolved a few more times.</p>
<p>There will come a time when the earth continues to turn, the sun rises once more over the limestone hills, but there is no prickly lettuce and there is no you. What little there was of you
  – beyond a collection of carbon-based chemicals – are the things you have sensed and your reactions to them. And so you stop and look at the lettuce. You glance once more at its leaves
  and then at the sun. And then you let the lettuce ask you some questions.</p>
<p>‘Which direction are you looking in, and what time is it?’</p>
<p>In taking the time to answer these questions you realize that the search takes you to the horizon and then beyond to the earth revolving and orbiting at 19 miles per second. The questions bring
  you back to the plant, it whispers a suggestion to look at its fellow prickly lettuces. They are all aligned. The prickly lettuce, you remember, has leaves that align north–south. It is
  flowering, which means it is late summer, and this means the sun has risen north of east. Whilst you are thinking about this, a sundial appears on the dry soil, as the leaves cast a shadow. The sun
  and flowers give you the understanding that you are looking south on a late summer morning, and invest that understanding with a meaningfulness that would be entirely absent if you were using a
  watch and compass. A weak sense of connection with time and place begins to form. You feel a surprising joy at this reaction, which fuels a slightly greater curiosity.</p>
<p>Then, to your shock, the lettuce whispers two new questions:</p>
<p>‘How are you and who are you?’</p>
<p>You pause, unsure how to answer. Then the plant suggests that the answer to the question will be found in how you perceive your surroundings and how you react to them.</p>
<p>The more we perceive, the greater our chances of discovering something that triggers a reaction. The more connections we notice between the nature we observe, our surroundings
  and ourselves, the profounder these reactions become. There is a strong correlation between the number of profound reactions we have to the things we notice in life, and the richness of life.</p>
<p>If someone or something surprises, delights, amazes or confounds you, then that is an encounter you will remember. The prickly lettuce, for instance, may be shy at first, but it will do all of
  these things, if you are curious enough. The harder it is to form a connection with a part of nature, the greater the reward we receive when we finally make that connection.</p>
<p>If our life is made up of perceptions and reactions, then the way we notice and react to a plant or animal helps define who we are. There is nothing original in making a billion dollars or
  ruling a nation; both have been done a thousand times before by others. The chances are that nobody has ever taken the time to solve the puzzle of how one particular straggly specimen of wild
  lettuce connects to them as an individual. This unusual line of enquiry will inevitably lead to changes in thought patterns, which will lead to noticing new things, which will subtly alter the way
  we think and then behave. The result will be originality.</p>
<p>There is a humility that comes with an interest in nature. If it does nothing else, nature can simultaneously excite us by hinting at what we can discover and humble us with our own ignorance.
  With each passing year this sensation grows. It would be hard to find a record of a person whose deathbed regret was taking too great an interest in their surroundings, although the opposite
  – regret for failing to fully engage with the world – is widespread and takes many forms.</p>
<p>A combination of humility and aspiration is a trait found in the most interesting of people. Those who choose to reside purely in the practical or philosophical world tend to scorn the land that
  lies between these two areas, the natural world. But those rare individuals who do things that change the way we think, or think in a way that changes how we behave, have, without exception,
  understood the insight that a connection with nature can offer.</p>
<p>Investigate any individual who has achieved extraordinary things and a fascination with nature will be found. They will have sought to understand the way the things that fascinate them fit into
  the broader network. The biggest and boldest ideas are still rooted alongside the plants and animals if we look hard enough. Einstein is best known for his mastery of the mathematical equations
  that help describe the fundamental physics of the universe, but it should not surprise us that he liked to walk in the Princeton woods each day.</p>
<p>We are all likely to feel a calling at some time in our lives to do something that transcends the ordinary, that goes beyond eating, drinking, reproducing and not shivering. It does not matter
  what lies at the top of our pyramid, whether it is creative, productive, cerebral, emotional or chaotic . . . Time spent considering nature will help. This is partly because a profound
  contemplation of anything has been proven to help us psychologically, whether it is labelled meditation, prayer or om-shan-ti-ing. An appreciation of nature
  enhances both a sense of humility and a fascination with the most ordinary of things. The words of Seneca call out to us from a different millennium: ‘It is characteristic of a great soul to
  scorn great things and prefer what is ordinary.’</p>
<p>Seneca is not alone in believing that people who find things interesting tend to be more interesting people.</p>
<p>Reconnecting with nature is not something that should be done. It is not something that we do because it is good in itself, or even because it is good for our health. It is a
  way of finding life more interesting, becoming a more interesting person and then achieving more interesting things.</p>
<p>Time spent considering a prickly lettuce might well help us to achieve the things that we currently consider more important than a lettuce. As you consider this, your mind may be dragged away by
  a practical need, a hunger that takes you somewhere else. Hunger will take you to the first steps of Maslow’s pyramid. What will happen if you bend down and pick some young leaves from the
  prickly lettuce to eat?</p>
<p>Your first reaction will be that the leaves taste quite bitter, but not wholly unpleasant. If your hunger drives you on to eat more, you may suddenly notice that the pain from your blister has
  evaporated and you have begun to feel relaxed and even a little sleepy. The plant contains lactucarium, which is a mild sedative and painkiller and has been used as an alternative to opium. As you
  lie down in your weak opiate daze, it occurs to you that this weed that few would notice has been your compass, your calendar, your clock, your grocer, your etymological teaser, your pharmacist and
  now your quiet companion.</p>
<p>We are what we eat, but nature offers us more than just food for our stomachs. It feeds us thoughts and ideas that help take us wherever we want to go. Nature suggests fascinating new paths for
  each of us – sometimes after a good sleep in the sun.</p>
