        <h2>Intelligent Eccentricity</h2>
<p>Honoré de Balzac was one of the most productive writers of the nineteenth century, turning out several novels every year for more than two decades. In order to squeeze such an achievement out of himself, he developed an exceptionally eccentric working routine. He couldn’t normally write during the day, so he would sleep during the morning and again in the evening and get up around 1 am. He put on a large monastic robe with a hood and wrote through the hours of darkness – often until around eight in the morning. As he worked, he drank around fifty cups of coffee (mixed with chocolate and brandy; this had an immense effect on his brain: ‘Ideas quick-march into motion like battalions of a grand army’).</p>
<p>If he’d been forced to work under standard conditions in an office during normal business hours, or had to wear normal clothes, if he’d been forbidden from taking his special drink... he would (we can well imagine) have been deeply unproductive. Balzac’s enormous output wasn’t a reflection of a freakish absence of the desire to procrastinate; rather, it depended on the strategies he adopted for combating his own resistance to work. He took his procrastination very seriously and was willing to go to dramatic lengths to overcome it.</p>
<p>Our own productivity might be transformed if – like Balzac – we were to follow our odder instincts and properly shape our lives around the real requirements of our working temperament.</p>
