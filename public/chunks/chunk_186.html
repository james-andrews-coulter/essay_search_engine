        <h2>PART II</h2>
<p>Repeat your three-minute walk, following the same route, only this time try to ignore anything that moves, as much as is safely possible. Let your eyes be drawn to things
      that remain still. Ignore everything that shows any motion at all, people, animals, leaves in a breeze. It should feel a little peculiar and lead to you noticing at least a few things that you
      overlooked on your first walk.</p>
<p>Our brains have learned to notice things that move, so if we make a special effort to look for things that are still we see a subtly different world. I would ask you to repeat
  your walk, this time looking for things with shapes and colours you find the most boring – but asking you to do so might test your enthusiasm for this exercise, so it can be a theoretical
  walk for now. We have survived as examples of our species because we successfully prioritize the things that are likely to be a threat or an opportunity. It is harder to get killed by things that
  are still, or boring colours, as this eliminates most predators and a lot of poisons.</p>
<p>We all see the world through a prism, our own personal lens, one that is shaped by both our experience and our goals. My work means that I spend a lot of time outdoors with experts and
  specialists – geographers, geologists, botanists, farmers, soldiers, artists, foragers, foresters – and one of the things I have found most interesting is that we are all incapable of
  experiencing the same patch of earth in the same way. We are all conditioned to look for certain things in certain places.</p>
<p>There is one particular experiment I like to conduct on my natural navigation courses that demonstrates the challenges and opportunities available by understanding our own personal lens. Early
  in one of my outdoors courses, I lead people up a short, steep, muddy bank of a field and then show them a tree, next to a fence, in the middle distance. I give them the following instructions:
  ‘I’d like you to stare at this tree for a whole minute. I want you to burn an image of its silhouette into your retina. Try to learn and memorize its shape and outline. Once you have
  done this we are going to walk for one minute and during this time it is very important that you don’t look back at the tree.’</p>
<p>I’d like you to look at the photograph on this page, it is the view that my students get and I’d like you to stare at the tree too.</p>
<p>Study this tree shape for 1 minute before reading on.</p>
<p>My students and I then walk for a minute, during which I make sure they do not peek at the tree. When we have reached the right spot, I ask them to turn round and look at the tree they think
  they know so well. Now look at the second photograph below.</p>
<p>Southwest is to the left of the picture; this is the direction the wind has come from.</p>
<p>The single tree has become two trees and completely changed shape. Most students are pleasantly shocked to have seen me wield my powers of magic in this way: ‘What pact
  has he made with the dark forces?’ is a line I hear them say to each other quite regularly. (That’s not true, but the rest is.)</p>
<p>I go on to explain that we can notice that certain trees are windswept and this can tell us where southwest is, since this is the direction that the prevailing winds blow from in the UK. My
  second point – which is more important than the simple technique of direction-finding – is that a tree’s appearance changes each time we look at it from a new spot; a tree
  gradually metamorphoses as we take each step. So far, so simple, but on more than one occasion this lesson did not go exactly as I had expected.</p>
<p>The aim of these courses is for me to help people see the world through a different lens to the one they are used to – a very specific natural navigation lens. The walks allow me to show
  students some of the things that practised observation can reveal in this one discipline, and the best places to look for them. The embarrassing truth is that during the visual experiment above, in
  the very short walk from one perspective point to another, which I know very well, I have had my own partial vision demonstrated to me. On various occasions, I have had an orchid, a fossilized
  animal and a bird of prey – a red kite – pointed out to me by other specialists. All these things I had failed to pick out through my lens of the moment. There were certainly
  innumerable other things that everyone in each group overlooked.</p>
<p>What is the broader lesson? I think that a focused interest is a two-edged sword: it allows us to notice many things that pass others by, but it narrows the spotlight of our vision. A keen
  passion for one area of nature will definitely encourage you to spot many things, but not everything. To use both edges of this sword in a positive way, we need to develop our interests, but then
  remain conscious of the blind spots these might introduce.</p>
<p>Natural navigation has made me weak at noticing some insects, but I am usually the first in a group to spot a planet at dusk. A forager will spot the ripening red on a bush before the tracker,
  but the tracker will notice the tiny thread of fur hanging off a thorn next to it. Staring into the distance, a sailor will notice the coming wind-change painted in the clouds, as the soldier spots
  the glint reflected off binoculars on the hill below them.</p>
<p>Experience will also teach us how the world appears differently with changes in light and the angle of the sun. Sailors learn to look ‘down-sun’ (with the sun behind you) when
  searching for something at sea, otherwise the glare blots everything out, but to look ‘up-moon’ as this is the best way to pick out detail in the low moonlight. Trackers like to look at
  details on the ground ‘up-sun’ as this casts more helpful shadows. Natural navigators know that you get the shortest shadows from a stick in the middle of the day, when the sun is
  highest, and that these cast a perfect north–south shadow line.</p>
<p>In time, everybody learns their own way to read the shift in shade, shadow and colour as the day and year progress. We can all appreciate the way flowers appear differently in the diffuse light
  of a spring morning than they do in the more intense sunlight of midday in summer.</p>
<p>It is a very rewarding exercise to do the same walk repeatedly, but with a different focus each time. (I sometimes like to put a different book in my backpack on each walk.
  Very often I don’t get it out at all, it just sits there and silently reminds me of the area I’m trying to focus on.) Then, allow a little time to pass and return to the walk without a
  specific focus or aim, but to enjoy a richer experience than you had on any one occasion previously.</p>
<p>Hearing</p>
<p>Before we analyse our sense of hearing it is worth doing another quick exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise 10</p>
<p>Stand outside and listen for one minute. Note down everything you hear.</p>
<p>Our sense of hearing is considered the weaker sense, but it has one very big advantage over sight: it is far less focused directionally. You can hear something that you cannot
  see – something behind your head, for example. Every moment outdoors is an opportunity to build an aural landscape, and it is possible to do this without consciously searching for
  anything.</p>
<p>An interest in what your ears are trying to describe for you will lead you to many discoveries that would otherwise go unnoticed, and this art of listening is likely to follow a progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We notice certain sounds and listen attentively to them for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We build a picture of the constant sounds, the fluctuating sounds and the intermittent sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We identify the sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We build a relationship between our location and these sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We mentally map the territory through sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We learn how the map changes with time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Listening for one minute, we might notice the following sounds: birdsong, the low rumble of a distant motorway, the wind in the trees. Each of these sounds is trying to enrich
  our understanding of our location. There is information about time of day, time of year, local animals, present and future weather, navigation clues and human behaviour.</p>
<p>As with what we see, each person’s experience and focus will lead them to create a different picture. The birdwatcher may make the following assessment: ‘There is a lot of birdsong,
  which I would expect at this time of day and year. I can hear the song of two distant male chiffchaffs. That means I must be standing close to the border of each male’s territory. I am
  standing at the Checkpoint Charlie for chiffchaffs. This means that whichever way I walk I will move into one of their territories and away from the other’s.’</p>
<p>The barefoot weather forecaster may note: ‘I can hear the wind rustling the trees to the northeast. A wind blowing from the northeast is not typical; the prevailing direction in the UK is
  from the southwest. This means that, although it is settled at the moment, I can expect unusual weather and a likely drop in temperature very soon, as cold air from over the continent reaches
  us.’</p>
<p>During some courses I like to lead people through dense woodland twice, once before an eyes-closed listening exercise and once after it. In the first patch of woodland, I ask everyone to close
  their eyes and spin themselves round, up to the point where they are totally disorientated, but still standing up. Then, with their eyes still shut, I ask them to point north. Few succeed. I have
  ensured that there is no bright sunlight, detectable breeze, land gradient or other non-visual clues to help them. There is one clue, but few tune into it without being prompted. The natural
  navigator needs to note similar things to both the birder and the forecaster, but also make a mental note of the direction of man-made noises – in this case, the motorway.</p>
<p>On the second walk through woodland, after making sure that everyone has noted that the dull distant murmur of the motorway is to the north, everyone can point north with their eyes closed
  effortlessly.</p>
<p>Listening attentively is a habit that is transferable into new areas. For example, if you listen carefully for a few weeks at home, you might start to become familiar with the bark of your
  neighbour’s dog. It might be possible to refine the art, so that you can distinguish between the bark that means another animal is passing by, and the bark that means that it is dinner time.
  You might even be able to distinguish between the bark that means a person is passing and one that means a person with a dog on a lead is passing.</p>
<p>Once you start listening in this way, you make many fresh discoveries and find new heroes. There are blind people who can describe a street by listening to the echoes of the clicks they make
  with their tongue. I love the way bakers pull a sponge from the oven and then lower an ear to the browning surface of the mixture to listen for gas escaping, or the old-timer mechanics who can
  identify the spark-plug that needs changing by cocking one ear.</p>
<p>One consequence of listening carefully is that we tend to become more aware of the creatures that can hear us too, including other people. If you are keeping a
  ‘listening watch’, you will notice the approach of other people before they become aware of your presence. This becomes a matter of pride for some.</p>
<p>You will also notice how silence reduces the likelihood of animals scarpering before you hear them, and therefore improves your chances of detecting them. The number of deer you see on a group
  walk will be inversely proportional to the number of people having a conversation. Squirrels in a wood, for example, tend to smell or hear us, then see us, then bound away across the forest floor
  to a tree-trunk escape. All we hear is the last rustle of leaves, like audible dust on our horizon. If you stay both still and silent, however, then the tables are often turned, especially in the
  case of upwind animals, and you get to see the creatures doing their work instead of hotfooting it. The American Indian technique of ‘still-hunting’, picking a spot and waiting silently
  for prey to find you, is just as effective when your intention is observation.</p>
<p>As our understanding of the way animals listen grows, we may ask ourselves the question: what do plants hear? Every year it seems there are more newspaper stories about the music plants
  prefer; there was even one recently about their favoured regional accent – Geordie, apparently. I hate to be the one to bang a loud cymbal and smash these notions, but there is no scientific
  evidence of plants reacting to music or noise of any kind. None. They are deaf. If that saddens you, then feel free to let your emotions go; the sound of your weeping will not slow the growth of
  the forest.</p>
<p>It is impossible to hear the same soundtrack twice outdoors. If we think we do, then it is just a sign that we are not focusing on what we hear. Our sensitivity to time is one
  measure of our sense of hearing. We will hear the minutes passing in the coming and going of creatures, the hours passing in the rise and fall of birdsong, and the months passing as every single
  sound shifts: the wind we hear in the trees changes as the leaves fall, and the sounds of our footsteps ebb with each fall of rain or snow.</p>
<p>The years pass and this is marked sadly by the fall in skylark song or, more cheerfully, by a new neighbourly owl.</p>
<p>Exercise 11</p>
<p>Stand outside, where you stood before, and listen for one minute. Note down everything you hear and the conclusions you are able to make. Forecast the weather, map the human
      and bird territories, point north with your eyes closed, but lack not ambition!</p>
<p>There were two people listening to nature today and they were both you, but one ought to be quietly impressed by the other.</p>
<p>Smell, Taste and Touch</p>
<p>Our nostrils contain clocks and calendars. I know this is true and if I forget it, then I will be reminded when, for instance, each nostril chimes together one June twilight
  with a honeysuckle waft. Our mouths struggle to keep up, but they can sometimes pick up the passing of the months in the sugars in the fruits. We taste the year passing in apples that roll from
  wincing sour to tongue-tickling sweet.</p>
<p>Our experience of smell and taste are intertwined and each is hardwired into an interesting part of our brains. These are the only two senses connected directly to our hippocampus, where our
  long-term memory resides. All other senses are routed via different parts and get processed elsewhere before finding their way to the hippocampus. A photograph of our schooldays will not whisk us
  back to that time as fast as the smell of cut grass and lawnmower exhaust or – worse, but faster still – the musty dank of the changing rooms.</p>
<p>Alongside the stinging nettle, we all quickly learn to recognize brambles. It is hard sometimes to persuade children to pause a moment to admire the colours of an early purple orchid, but when
  they have been snared and scratched by brambles a few times they are happy to conduct their own lessons in awareness: ‘Watch out! Let’s find another way.’</p>
<p>Fortunately when we are young we are resilient and have deep wells of enthusiasm to draw on. Our next lesson, after a bramble scratch, might be to trip over an inconspicuous root and feel that
  sore marker of youth: cold wet mud congealing on raw red palms. Our sense of touch begins with these painful reminders, but as our experience grows we use it to swerve around the most dramatic
  sensations and look for subtler triggers. We come to know that a teasel will tickle but not hurt and that each tree’s bark feels different, from the aloof flat coolness of a beech to the warm
  corkiness of a field maple.</p>
<p>Human touch is one of the most intimate experiences. We are all aware of the rules of engagement regarding touch with other people. A hand placed on someone’s shoulder is different to a
  hand on the waist and the potential for clear and mixed signals is well known. Animals in the wild rarely let us touch them, and plants seem oblivious; but we can be surprised by both. One of my
  fondest memories is of a tame squirrel, made fearless by the number of walkers that must have passed the same way, climbing up my leg and drinking from the water bottle that rested on my knee.</p>
<p>But what about these nonchalant plants? Any that react to our presence have the potential to intrigue. Experiments have shown that the majority of plants will react adversely to repetitive
  touching. Trees that are repeatedly buffeted by the wind will grow shorter and stouter trunks than sheltered ones, leading to wedge-shaped copses on hillsides. But like people, some plants are more
  sensitive than others. The burr cucumber is ten times more sensitive to touch than humans. Scientists have shown that these vines will grow towards the lightest of touches of a piece of string.
  This is biologically very impressive, but as animals we are unlikely to be bowled over by such slow reactions: it is visible movement that we react to most strongly.</p>
<p>The Mimosa pudica grows in the Americas and is both very sensitive to touch and willing to show it. If you touch the Mimosa pudica, its leaflets rapidly recoil, folding inwards
  and then drooping. The pudica part of the name is a clue – it means ‘shy’ in Latin. Its names in Hebrew and Bengali translate as ‘don’t touch me’ and
  the ‘shy virgin’ respectively and respectably.</p>
<p>We can remind ourselves of the power of touch by closing our eyes again. The blind, as is so often the case, lead the way in this field. A Braille wristwatch has been developed that allows a
  blind person to tell the time with their fingers, but for many blind people these prove unnecessary as they are already able to tell the time with a broader sense of touch. By remaining sensitive
  to shifts in sunlight angles, temperatures and the atmosphere, these individuals have a sense of time that is more ‘real’ than numbers.</p>
<p>Trees that are repeatedly buffeted by the wind will grow shorter and stouter trunks than sheltered ones, leading to wedge-shaped copses on hillsides.</p>
<p>Exploring the senses means investigating a range of ideas, techniques and experiences. When new to any of these it is best to absorb and practise them in isolated ways. When we
  are comfortable with them individually, we can bring several together in one experience. The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>Soon we experience the outdoors in a way that makes our earlier view of it seem a pale imitation. Edward O. Wilson described the higher awareness that it is possible to achieve as the
  ‘naturalists’ trance’, whereby biologists are able to locate more elusive organisms. We can all use it to hunt the most elusive of creatures: the perfect nature experience.</p>
