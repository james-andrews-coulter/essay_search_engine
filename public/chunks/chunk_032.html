        <h3>4. Animals</h3>
<p>We are back from work unusually late. It’s been a tricky day: a threatened resignation, an enraged supplier, a lost document, two delayed trains ... But none of the mayhem is of any concern to a very good friend waiting by the door uncomplicatedly pleased to see us: Pippi, a 2-year-old Border Terrier with a continuous appetite for catching a deflated football in her jaws. She wants to play in the usual way, with us in the chair and her sliding around the kitchen, even if it’s past 9 o’clock now – and, unexpectedly, so do we. We’re not offended by her lack of overall interest in us. It’s at the root of our delight. Here, at last, is someone wholly indifferent to almost everything about us except for our dexterity at ball-throwing; someone who doesn’t care about the Brussels meeting, who will forgive us for being a slightly bad spouse or parent or for not warning the finance department in time about the tax rebates, and for whom the Singapore conference is beyond imagining.</p>
<p>One of the most consoling aspects of our animal friends is that their interests have nothing whatsoever to do with our own perilous and tortured priorities. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest sense of our role on the planet.</p>
<p>A sheep doesn’t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never emailed. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we’re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool, and for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused glance.</p>
<p>A duck doesn’t care if there’s an election or what happens to the stock market or in the final exams. Time is of no concern; the news is an irrelevance; ducks would have been doing much the same thing when Napoleon was leading his armies across Europe or when the first nomads made their way towards the Appalachian hills.</p>
<p>Our encounters with animals calm us because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes have any relevance to them. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of a dog, a sheep, a llama or a Chinese giant salamander; they are important representatives of an entirely different perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.</p>
