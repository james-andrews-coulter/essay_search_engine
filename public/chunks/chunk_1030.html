<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>How’s Gina getting on? Rather better than when we last saw her. As it happens she’s been reading this book: someone gave it to her as a thirtieth birthday present. Under plain cover. She knows that books don’t change lives (only authors think they do – and only before they start writing), but they can fertilize new ideas and she’s been having some, mainly because of the recent death of her grandmother.</p>
<p>Betty was 91 when she died. She was a vibrant woman, elegant to the last, who became less judgemental as she aged and not more.</p>
<p>Gina loved her, and at her funeral made three resolutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Never again to say of someone ‘she must have been beautiful’, as though age were some necrotizing organism that eats away at beauty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever she felt anxious about her own encroaching wrinkles, to imagine herself fifteen years older so that, in comparison, she looked positively peachy. She thought of this as a reverse facelift. (‘But what will you do,’ demanded her mother, ‘when you reach 90?’ ‘By then I’ll be happy just to still be alive.’)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remember that Betty, until the very end, thought that life was an adventure: she was always seizing new opportunities, conversing with strangers and reading new books. (She was enthralled by the e-reader Gina gave her, which, by magnifying the font of downloaded books, gave her access to a vast library at a stroke, despite her failing sight.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although her life had been extremely hard at times and she was no stranger to anxiety and loss, Betty was committed to living, and consciously made decisions that sided with life. She showed Gina that ageing can mean adding new resources and qualities as you grow older, and not subtracting them. Gina is also coming to realize that growing older is a privilege which, instead of fearing, she might do better to hope for. (Hope I age – what a slogan this would be!) In short, she has started to understand that ageing is a process, and not a crisis.</p>
<p>There’s never been a better time to age. This might sound like a curious claim, after the inventory of gerontophobia, prejudice and discrimination laid out on some of the previous pages. But there’s never been a better time to challenge the narratives of decline and age-resistance, and seek out other people in the growing age-acceptance movement – those who are pro-age.</p>
<p>Of course the conditions that make ageing hard in modern societies need collective social and political action, but there are campaigns on everything from continuing education to the provision of public toilets. And there are so many more that need starting or strengthening – support, training and decent pay for carers, for instance. Or the right for old people to remain embodied: as much as younger people, older people need to touch and be touched; to taste good food; to stretch, move and dance.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should revive the Age Awareness Training courses developed by Catherine Itzin in the 1980s. These allowed people to ‘own’ their age, to think in a safe group about what’s good about the age they are, and to discuss their fears of ageing and hopes for their future aged selves.</p>
<p>Above all, we need to remind ourselves that ageing is a lifelong process, and not just something that occurs at the end of our lives: the seeds we plant earlier are what we harvest later. Mary Catherine Bateson has suggested that, today, ‘we live longer but think shorter.’ So we need to adjust our thinking, both individually and collectively: to both live and think longer. It’s easy to get dispirited along the way, to feel that the forces ranged against ageing in the full, free and creative sense discussed here are too powerful. But apartheid and the Berlin Wall also used to seem as if they’d last forever. Eventually, though, both were dismantled. Eventually, too, we may come to view both ageism and the denial of age as enduring but now discredited historical relics. The trick is to live our lives as though that time had already arrived.</p>
<p>This book asks you to try to reconceive your own ageing, and to get in touch with it. It even has the temerity to suggest that, instead of fearing or denying the ageing process, it can be embraced. It argues that we can become more vital and not less as we grow older. In order to reach this place, though, some hard psychic work is required: vulnerability and death both need to be granted entry and not magicked away. Acknowledging death graces us with a sense of perspective: it reminds us that we have only a finite number of breaths; it makes us ask ourselves ‘How will I feel when I get to the end of my life having done/without having done this?’</p>
