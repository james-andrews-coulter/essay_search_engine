        <h3>2The instinct for endorsement</h3>
<p>There is a second instinct that drives us in love: the Instinct for Endorsement. We have many issues and feelings that we are lonely with, misunderstood for and that most people don’t get or are uninterested in: perhaps we dislike certain people who are generally popular; maybe we are anxious about things that others are robust around; we might have sorrows that no one else seems to share, or we could have excitements and interests that carry no echo in others.</p>
<p>We might then be powerfully attracted to people who seem to understand the lonely aspects of us. We love them for their ability to endorse fragile, isolated, offbeat traits. They ‘get’ us, in contrast to the legions of the insensitive who cannot.</p>
<p>When we are finally with the ideal endorsing candidate, we feel engaged in a small conspiracy against the rest of the world. We don’t have to explain very much about ourselves. They just know. They ‘get’ things quickly, without us having to speak. They read our souls, so we don’t have to spell out their contents in the normal, arduous way. Our love is a dividend of gratitude for their magical ability to understand.</p>
<p>Perhaps we really like doing jigsaw puzzles – an interest that our more intellectual friends scoff at. Or we have a sexual quirk that we have never dared to share with past partners. Or we have sympathy for a political figure that everyone else seems to despise. Or we really love but also feel suffocated by our mother, and that has always sounded odd to people. Or no one seems to understand and forgive us for just how stressed we get around administrative tasks. Or we used to love crawling under our bed when we were a child – and we still like that part of us but we don’t find it easy to bring it into the open. All of this the ideal partner will – on their own – simply know.</p>
