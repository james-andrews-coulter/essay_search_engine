        <h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>There is similar wisdom to be found in those parts of the landscape where nature hints at its true age and force – for example, in the great deserts, by the oceans, at the feet of glaciers or beside the gaping mouths of volcanoes.</p>
<p>We generally pull a tablecloth of a human scale across the Earth and deck it with wheat fields, parks, advertising hoardings and bank towers that help to puff us up and reassure us of our relevance. But occasionally we’re reminded of what latecomers we are and how puny our mightiest moments must appear when compared with the forces of nature. We can stand in the Sonoran Desert and contemplate geology that took form 1,200 million years ago, find Palaeozoic shale and limestone that are 240–570 million years old, in which lie fossilised remains of trilobites and brachiopods. We can unearth layers of rhyolite and basalt that were shaped by volcanic explosions 70 million years before we were born, in terrain that was once warm tropical jungle teeming with insects the size of birds.</p>
<p>It isn’t just to avoid other humans that we would be wise to make our new post failure home on the edge of a desert. It is because every day, as we take in the landscape around us, we will be eloquently reminded that our erasure is in the end no more tragic or worthy of lament than the disappearance of the Earth’s therapsids in the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago (including the adorable Mastodonsaurus, who existed blithely and happily for 45.75 million years longer than the pithy 250,000 years that Homo sapiens has walked the Earth).</p>
<p>In our desert home, we will already be living in an eternity in which we are not included.</p>
