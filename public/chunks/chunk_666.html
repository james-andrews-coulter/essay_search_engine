            <h3>¶ Saints</h3>
<p>The idea of a saint can sound very remote from the normal concerns of modern life. But the religious tradition of saints encapsulates an important idea that isn’t necessarily tied to religion at all.</p>
<p>Saints were once identified and venerated by churches in an attempt to promote important ideas via the lives and characters of specific people. A saint might be famous for being very kind (like St. Francis of Assisi) or for staying cheerful in a demanding office job (like St. Philip Neri, whose catchphrase was ‘Let me get through today’); or a parent who was extremely patient with a difficult child (like St. Monica). The point about a saint wasn’t simply that they were very good or holy, but that they had some specific and very important lesson to teach us.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we still hero-worship, but we focus on people who are unusually talented, powerful or beautiful. They have nothing in particular to impart to us, other than – unwittingly – to humiliate us for being so ordinary. The idea of a saint holds out a more realistic and wiser option: that we should channel admiration for others in directions that will help us manage our own lives better.</p>
<p>The decline in religious belief has not made the underlying thesis behind saints irrelevant. There is an idea within them that needs to be rescued. Human beings need role models. We shouldn’t complain about or eradicate role models; we need to improve the genre, bringing a better sort of person to the fore of public consciousness. We need better celebrities rather than no celebrities.</p>
<p>We should take more seriously the task of creating ‘good celebrities’, versions of secular saints who demonstrate with seductive clarity virtues that need to be more prominent in society. As part of this venture, one might, for example, set up prizes to locate: ‘The introvert who most successfully managed to communicate what he/she felt to their partner’; ‘The child who most generously forgave their parents’; ‘The worker who most intelligently defused infighting at the office’, or, the most elusive target of all: ‘The husband who best learnt to control his temper and say sorry.’</p>
<p>Being good won’t ever be the result merely of hearing lectures on the subject; it requires that we see goodness enacted in the lives of intermittently ordinary but profoundly charming and inspiring people all around us.</p>
