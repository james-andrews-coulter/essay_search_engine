        <h3>Happiness is cyclical</h3>
<p>We know the lesson well enough in relation to the seasons: autumn will follow summer; balmy evenings need to give way to bitter winds. In love, we long so much for eternally clear skies, but there can be no avoiding periods of harshness and reversal. The very desire to get married is, in a sense, born of a wish to be content forever. Yet nothing human is capable of such endurance and stability. We are creatures mostly made of water; our vows can only ever be aspirations written in air, rather than guarantees chiselled in marble.</p>
<p>Inevitably, therefore, we will hit problems – serious ones, too, at risk of being made all the worse by our innocence. Last week everything might have appeared masterable. We were looking forward to the future; we couldn’t imagine not delighting in one another. And yet we’re in difficulties again. Someone is angry about something; someone isn’t sure any more. There was shouting and even some very horrid insults. We can’t even quite remember the sequence, but we know well enough the moods of resentment, suspicion and scratchiness in which we are now mired.</p>
<p>We should take comfort from knowing that, as sure as this storm descended on us, so it will lift. Our challenges are those of every human who has ever tried to tie themselves intimately to another. We are suffering under no undue curse; we are just trying to do something very difficult.</p>
