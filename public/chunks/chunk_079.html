        <h2>Individuals vs. institutions</h2>
<p>Romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals taking destiny into their hands and struggling against the inertia and conservatism of the mass and, most importantly, of institutions.</p>
<p>Melancholic voters are deeply worried by the possibility of lone actors taking matters into their own hands and, through natural weaknesses which all of us – even the most intelligent – are afflicted by, creating disaster. They are, therefore, on the side of legally grounded, extremely slow-moving institutions that are designed to restrain individual power and contain the capacity of any one person to shift the direction of the group too quickly.</p>
