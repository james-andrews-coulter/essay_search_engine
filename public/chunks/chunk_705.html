        <h3>¶ Work/Life Balance</h3>
<p>We have formed ever-higher expectations about what it means to be a good parent in exactly the same historical epoch in which the importance of work has been stressed as never before. The demands of the labour market have not been offset by any reduction in the expectations around intimacy, devotion or time in the home. We are under more pressure to succeed at work and under more pressure to be very continually present and focused domestically.</p>
<p>The notion of ‘balance’ has been, rather cruelly, proposed to solve the problem. But the truth is that we can rarely contrive a just accommodation between competing demands. By definition, any worthwhile project will unbalance our lives and demand too much of us. We’d understand the impossibility of society routinely asking us to become experts at chess while also holding down a career as a rally car driver. It is not the fault of the world, or of ourselves, that we don’t see that we are asking ourselves something very similar on a routine basis. Not all good ideals are compatible. A society cannot be highly democratic and highly rational at the same time; a business cannot be daringly innovative and a rock-solid investment. And we cannot be perfect parents and perfect workers. We can, at best, hope to be good enough.</p>
