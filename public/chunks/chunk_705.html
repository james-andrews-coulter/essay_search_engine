        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>How did we arrive at the tragic conviction that no one could know us and love us at the same time?</p>
<p>Complete the sentences:</p>
<p>•   My mother made me feel I was …</p>
<p>•   My father made me feel I was …</p>
<p>•   From my early years, I learnt I was essentially …</p>
<p>•   My past taught me that my body was …</p>
<p>•   The younger me believed that I deserved …</p>
<p>The adult process of recovery involves grasping that we have indeed absorbed unduly harsh ideas about who we are, but that it is entirely in our power to begin to counteract them by imagining how a better caregiver might have supported us in the past – and how a kind lover might help us in the future. An ideal, compassionate figure would have known at the start never to equate lovability with perfection; they could have cared for us despite our coming last in the race, our missteps and our confusions.</p>
