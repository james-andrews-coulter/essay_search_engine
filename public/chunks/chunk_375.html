        <h4>7. Train the Children</h4>
<p>There is a strong – and I think well-founded – sense that solitude is a learned skill. We know that sociability is culturally acquired: think of all the hours we
  put in to teaching children to ‘share’, not to bite each other, to be grateful, to moderate and manage anger and, as they get older, to dress appropriately, not to steal or lie and to
  consider other people’s feelings. No one expects this to come ‘naturally’ to children, even though we also believe that human beings are genetically programmed for group
  interaction, are inherently social and need, for true flourishing, both to achieve intimate one-to-one relationships and to ‘win friends and influence people’. But far from
  putting similar efforts into encouraging children to develop a healthy capacity to be alone, or to explore what being alone means to them, and to enjoy solitude, we go to extraordinary lengths to
  ‘protect’ them from any such practice and experience. I believe that this disables them, or at the very least does not equip them for life events which at some time or another they are
  extremely likely to encounter.</p>
<p>If you are scared of being alone yourself it can be challenging to allow your children to experience aloneness. We know that being alone is extremely important to some people – and may
  happen to anyone. We know that solitude is almost a necessity for creativity and the development of a genuinely and richly autonomous sense of identity. We seek out a wide range of experiences for
  our children – and want their schools to provide these too. We want young people to develop useful internal risk-assessment abilities, resilience and the capacity to remain strong and well in
  future difficult situations. We want them to have rich imaginations, physical competence, freedom and as much joy as possible. All these things are enhanced by solitude and by the ability to enjoy
  being alone sometimes.</p>
<p>There are some strategies for developing these skills in the young. Unfortunately, many child psychologists, and particularly the authors of popular childrearing ‘textbooks’, have
  taken the view that a child’s psyche is immensely fragile and must be cherished almost obsessively; that any fear is damaging and that children must be protected at all costs from any moment
  of alarm, even if this means losing out on positive and enriching experiences the other side of that moment of fear. I feel that we, as a society, have allowed our own fear of solitude to affect
  our judgement and encourage us to advocate ever greater levels of intervention, overprotection, stimulation and social interaction. Some childcare experts, however, have courageously stood out
  against the tide of fashion: Anthony Storr and more recently Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods (2005), are examples worth exploring. However, the following list of ways to
  give our children safe experience of and practice in solitude, though drawn from their and others’ writing, are my own:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow your newborn time for the infantile reverie I discussed earlier in the book. Let him or her just lie in your arms; do not seek emotional engagement, like
        eye-contact, immediately. Enjoy for yourself the peace and warmth of being gazed at by your baby. If you cannot refrain from trying to engage with the child, sing – best of all,
        wordlessly – rather than talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let your toddler play alone sometimes. Do not interfere or make reactive play obligatory. In my experience woods are a very good place to practise elementary solitude. This
      is because the child can experience herself as unsupervised while you are actually very near. She can vanish behind a tree and believe she is alone, even though she is only a couple of metres
      away and you can hear every move. Woods are very beautiful and fascinating to small people, while in fact being remarkably safe – there are no real predators, you can hear other people
      approaching; unlike water, where children really can and do drown, not many bad things actually happen in a wood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read them stories about children alone, who face real dangers and overcome them. This is the central moral message of classic fairy stories where the hero or heroine, alone
      and in serious difficulties, turns things to their own advantage by courage and cunning. Many of these stories have endured for hundreds (if not thousands) of years; they must be getting
      something right. Adults are often scared of frightening their children, but watch a child – they like to be a little frightened, so long as it ends up all right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that it is good for children to be bored sometimes. Children who are not continually provided with stimuli develop more active imaginations, a stronger sense of
      self-sufficiency and, probably, higher self-esteem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delay as long as possible giving them their own mobile phone. If there is a practical need on specific occasions, or they are doing something that makes you anxious, then
      lend them one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never use isolation (‘go to your room’) as a punishment. They will not be in a mood to use their solitude positively and they will associate being alone with
      being bad and unhappy. Instead, if you are able to provide them with space of their own, offer them ‘time out’ as a reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only interrupt a child engaged in a solitary activity (reading, solitary hobbies, loafing about outside) if you have a clear and specific reason which you can articulate.
      (‘You have to come in now because it is supper time’ vs ‘Darling, are you all right out there alone?’)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our children are not happy. I believe this is because over the last half century we have increasingly monitored, supervised and attended to them, and pampered their supposedly
  frail egos. The original motivation for this was deeply benign, but the sorry fact is that it is not working. We have an increasing number of children with diagnosable mental health issues (10 per
  cent of children between one and sixteen is suffering from a diagnosable mental ‘disorder’ at any given time); we have too many children with pathetically short attention spans; we have
  profoundly alienated youths, who seem to have remarkably poor judgement and serious issues with personal risk assessment, who do not trust adults and do not choose to engage with them. In 2007, a
  report from UNICEF ranked the UK bottom in childhood wellbeing compared to other industrialized nations. In 2009, a survey of 16-to-25-year-olds by the Prince’s Trust found 1 in 10 believed that ‘life was not worth living’.</p>
<p>Woods are a very good place to practise elementary solitude.</p>
<p>These figures are terribly sad. We are doing something wrong. I am not, of course, suggesting that more solitude for young people would solve all these serious, and indeed tragic, problems
  instantly, but given the known, beneficial effects of solitude already discussed in this book it might be worth giving them a chance to try it. For me, two important issues are that solitude in
  childhood appears to be an almost universal experience of creative people and that children love being frightened in a generally safe context (that is why fairgrounds remain in business).</p>
<p>Children, like grown-ups, need different amounts of direct stimulus, company, social engagement and time alone. Neither you nor they can know which sort of person they are if they cannot ever
  try out solitude.</p>
