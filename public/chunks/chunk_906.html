        <h3>Love</h3>
<p>And yet, despite everything, this is a book about love. Which means, first and foremost, this is a book about forgiveness, charity and the need to display ongoing kindness towards ourselves and others for the difficulty and foolishness involved in being human.</p>
<p>We would – naturally – have every right to be furious about how things often end up in relationships. But to commit ourselves to love involves an almost arbitrary decision to approach matters in another way: no longer as an angry customer whose guarantees and promises have been betrayed, but as a parent looking at their wilful, very naughty and only intermittently sane child, knowing that whatever the chaos and the challenge, love will go on.</p>
<p>Every time we confront a problem, we can at least be assured that there is a chance to learn. Beneath any conflict is something we have not yet mastered. We are in pain again, but we have been granted another opportunity to be curious and to take a lesson at an establishment we are bittersweetly never quite done with: the school of love.</p>
