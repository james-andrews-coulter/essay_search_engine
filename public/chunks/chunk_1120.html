        <h2>Coburg</h2>
<p>Much of our professional anxiety can be traced back to a belief that we should never, ever end up living in a ‘boring’ suburb, one like Coburg in Australia, 9 kilometres north of Melbourne’s central business district. To do so would mean abandoning any claim to being interesting, vibrant or alive; we’d be resigning ourselves to mediocrity and tedium. And therefore, in order to be able to afford to live closer to the centre, we have to work extremely hard; we are constantly scared that we might lose our jobs; we can rarely take a risk; we live in dread of every misstep.
Our age is dominated by a fear of missing out, powered by a conviction that somewhere in privileged and secret locations lives are unfolding that are uncommonly exciting, sexually fulfilled, interesting, beautiful and content, just as most lives everywhere else are fated to be humdrum, mediocre and banal.
Evidence of this worry is clearly visible in property prices. A house close to the centre may cost double or treble the amount of an equivalent one a few kilometres away: it’s possible to put a rather precise number on the horror of not being where it’s at.
To live contentedly in the suburbs requires us to adopt a distinct perspective which, if we were able to acquire it, would free us to enjoy a great many more options and to walk with far less fear through our workplace dilemmas.
A philosophy of the suburbs doesn’t deny that there are, here and there, pockets of excellence: people with unusually kind hearts; groups of friends who are especially alive to, and entertaining about, the absurd sides of life; creatives who are especially talented or stylish. But what it denies is that such qualities can handily be tied to a single clan or location. It insists that goodness is an elusive trait that is promiscuously scattered through society and is not to be equated with any one simplistic
marker (a given school, an age bracket, a skin type, a religion, a job or a postal code). One of the most fascinating people we could ever hope to meet might be a retired geography teacher working at the garden centre, who graduated from a provincial college no one has ever heard of. We might glimpse one of the most beautiful people in the world in the frozen-food section of the supermarket. The best novel of the century might, at this very moment, be being written in a boring-looking house between the recycling plant and the station. We have as much chance of connecting with true greatness, sincerity, depth and purity in a forgotten province as in any hallowed centre.
Were we able to take the thought to heart, we would be able to stop scouring the globe restlessly in search of a metropolitan paradise. We would know that life is never simply elsewhere, and that it might when we look with sufficient imagination and courage be going on in its own way right here, right now.</p>
