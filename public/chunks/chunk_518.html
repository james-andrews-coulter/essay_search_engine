        <h2>The Distraction of Pornography</h2>
<p>The nineteenth-century English painter J. M. W. Turner was celebrated for his noble-minded heroic landscapes and moody, impressionistic sketches.</p>
<p>But he also spent a lot of time making a vast number of more-or-less explicit pornographic drawings. When he was supposed to be painting a majestic sunset, he would often be procrastinating by pencilling a few erotic scenes. He was particularly interested in fellatio.</p>

<p>After Turner’s death, his executor – the critic and social reformer John Ruskin – carefully hid the drawings to protect Turner’s reputation as a great artist. But actually Ruskin did us a disservice. He tried to hide from the world a crucial bit of evidence: even a hugely accomplished and successful artist like Turner was plagued by a tendency towards dithering and avoidance of real work through the use of sexual imagery.</p>
<p>Ruskin’s censorship dissuaded us from considering how common it is for our procrastination to adopt an embarrassing but not inherently shameful form: sexual fantasy. Knowledge of his images can help reduce our unhelpful self-disgust around our own sexual daydreams. It’s not impressive that pornography distracts us – but it is both natural and entirely consistent with being a serious and interesting person.</p>
