        <h2>6. A Very Short Chapter on Death</h2>
<p>Since 1951 no one in the USA has died of old age. This was the year old age was deleted as a cause of death from death certificates; from then on you could only die of a disease. In the UK doctors are advised to avoid ‘old age’ as the sole cause of death, except in very limited circumstances.</p>
<p>Such a change might seem benign: surely it helps us avoid seeing old age as the stepping stone to death? Shouldn’t we applaud the idea that it’s disease and not age that ends our lives? But while this shift appears, on the face of it, simply to reflect advances in medical science, its causes and implications are more complex. Severing any link between ageing and death is another manifestation of our denial of death – death has to go underground, and not just literally. In addition, in both the USA and UK, it’s now illegal to list ‘natural causes’ on its own on a death certificate: not only has this contributed to the medicalization of old age identified in Chapter 4, but it has also helped foment the view that death is unnatural.</p>
<p>Along with gerontophobia, our culture suffers from thanatophobia, an overwhelming fear of death. This is reinforced by the way that death, like old age, has been sequestered from the rest of society – more people now die in hospital or a nursing home than in their own home. Such is the taboo against death that children are often excluded from the funerals of relatives on the grounds that ‘it will upset them’, though they often later express regret that they had no opportunity to say goodbye.</p>
<p>The temerity to die</p>
<p>In Western countries death is increasingly regarded as medical failure rather than an inevitable part of life. There’s just one entry for death in the index to Aubrey de Grey’s 377-page book, Ending Aging. New Age guru Deepak Chopra invites his followers to become pioneers in a land where ‘old age, senility, infirmity and death do not exist and are not even entertained as a possibility’. Now where would that be – la-la land? In highly individualistic cultures death seems like a personal affront, a narcissistic wound, an attack on our individual subjectivity. And this helps forge our attitudes to growing older.</p>
<p>Old age and death represent everything modern societies thought they’d vanquished and hoped they’d eliminated. Old people do something unforgiveable: by failing to control the eventual decline of their bodies, they contravene the idea that the human body is infinitely malleable. What a terrible reminder of our ultimate powerlessness, of the inevitability of death! For transgressing the idea of human omnipotence they must be punished and shamed – age-shamed. The more defended you are against your own mortality, the more likely you are to subscribe to ageist ideas: researchers have found, for example, that nursing staff with high levels of ‘death anxiety’ have significantly more negative attitudes to older people.</p>
<p>Admitting death</p>
<p>There is, though, another way of dealing with death that makes ageing much easier: paradoxically, it’s thinking about our own mortality more and not less, and incorporating it into our daily lives. Death needs to accompany us through life, and not stalk us. Morbid? No – Buddhist.</p>
<p>Although she was only 41 when her novel Memento Mori was published, Muriel Spark understood the need for death to accompany us through life.</p>
<p>Muriel Spark, although she was only 41 when her novel Memento Mori was published, understood this. All the book’s elderly characters are plagued by anonymous phone calls in which the caller only ever says the same solitary sentence, ‘Remember you must die’. But, says Miss Taylor, one of the characters, it’s difficult for people of ‘advanced years’ to start remembering that they might die. ‘It is better to form the habit while young.’ Another character, Henry Mortimer, goes further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I had my life over again I should form the habit of nightly composing myself to thoughts of death. I would practise, as it were, the remembrance of death. There is no other practice which so intensifies life. Death, when it approaches, ought not to take one by surprise. It should be part of the full expectancy of life. Without an ever-present sense of death life is insipid. You might as well live on the whites of eggs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practising remembering death: it’s an intriguing idea and an eminently sensible one. The American poet May Sarton gave a lot of thought to the subject. As usual, she put it simply: ‘One must live as though one were dying – and we all are, of course – because then the priorities become clear.’</p>
<p>Coming to terms with our mortality isn’t easily achieved, or a single event – it’s a lifelong process. Of course death is frightening and can fill us with existential terror. As Woody Allen put it: ‘I’m not afraid of death, I just don’t want to be there when it happens.’ Accepting death involves a kind of mourning – for oneself. It can also excite anger over the ways in which life has disappointed us, and we’ve disappointed others. (This is why it needs to begin early, so that we have enough time to make changes.) It demands a letting go of one’s sense of omnipotence, a facing up to finitude. There’s something humbling about it.</p>
<p>Although we all die in the singular, (our death, even if it happens in a war or plane crash, is particular to us), trying to accept it alongside others makes us feel less singled out, less persecuted by it. Interesting new initiatives are doing just this. At ‘Death Cafe’ events, people come together in a relaxed and safe setting to discuss death, drink tea and eat cake. They don’t provide bereavement support or grief counselling; their objective is to ‘increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives’. Some 1,000 people have participated so far in such cafes in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and Italy.</p>
<p>Or there’s the Order of the Good Death, founded in 2011 by Caitlin Doughty, a mortician and writer in Los Angeles, with the aim of bringing realistic discussion of death into popular culture. With her interest in bodily decomposition, Doughty might seem to lie at the fetishistic end of the spectrum. But less esoteric is her idea of making death a part of life by staring down one’s fears. Comments on the Order of the Good Death’s Web site show that there’s a real appetite for opening up death in this way.</p>
<p>Maggie Kuhn used to encourage people to compile a life line or life review from their birth. When she urged them to also put in the year they thought they’d die, people always gasped. She maintained, though, that this helped raise their consciousness of their own death. For once you start to really take on board the fact that you’re going to die, old age becomes a lot less terrifying: it means you’re not dead yet.</p>
<p>‘People who cannot look ahead as they grow older back into the future,’ according to Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, so all they see is the past. But ‘when we de-repress the fear of death, we reclaim the energy that has gone into denial. We feel buoyed up as streams of creative energy course through our bodies, minds and nervous systems. By facing a subject that usually depresses and terrifies us, we feel lighter, freer, more perceptually and cognitively alive in all our encounters.’</p>
<p>This is an essential task for the non-old for another reason too. The more that we engage with death when it isn’t imminent, the less we’ll require of older people that they be associated only with dying. Old age will no longer be a synonym for death, or dying, but for living.</p>
<p>And when we reach their age we’ll reap the benefits.</p>
