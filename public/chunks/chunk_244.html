        <h3>Small luxuries</h3>
<p>Although it often – and sometimes fairly – gets confused with status seeking and showing off, at its best, luxury represents a concerted effort by one set of humans to provide carefully thought-out pleasure to another. It is, in the material realm, akin to the work of love.</p>
<p>Luxury arises from the attempt to answer the question: if we didn’t have to keep costs down, what would be the nicest, kindest and most generous possible version of something – a hotel, villa, car, restaurant or airline seat? Of course, this also means that, most of the time, major luxuries are unaffordable.</p>
<p>But what we too often forget, especially on our sadder, more restricted days, is that the core pleasures of luxury also exist in small forms that can be accessed at a far more manageable cost by pretty much anyone at any time. In certain categories, we can all have the privileges open to monarchs and potentates. We can walk into a fancy bakery and treat ourselves to the very finest brioche roll, wrapped for us with care by a dedicated and proud assistant. We can, when it comes to fruit juice, show maximal decadence and financial heedlessness.</p>
<p>The best way to identify the most suitable micro-luxuries lies in analysing what really appeals to us in the grand ones. For instance, if we think about a fabulous watch, it may turn out that – for us – a central attraction is the beautifully precise engineering of its springs and cogs. Once we have this in mind, we may find that a related and comparable pleasure is available to us when we purchase a high-quality, double-lever corkscrew. At a vastly more modest price point, it too has been superbly designed: its toothed wheels elegantly transform the downward pressure of our hands into an upward thrust; the action is smooth and reassuringly solid. We’re accessing the same pleasure zone from an unexpected angle.</p>
<p>Similarly, the world’s loveliest cars may be out of our reach, but we could quite easily purchase a box of some of the best pencils in the world. The pencil manufacturers have the same fundamental ambition as the car designers: to take a practical object and make it as pleasurable to use as possible. They have considered what kind of wood is best for sharpening; what surface texture gives the firmest grip; what the ideal weight and balance should be; and what lead gives the most satisfying line. They have aimed at perfection, and the resulting product does not need an exorbitant price tag. We can, on a very modest salary, buy the best pencil available.</p>
<p>The facade of a French chateau on the market for multiple millions may delight us with its refined proportions, but we can buy an equally refined plate and eat a slice of toast off it each morning. One thing that may appeal about a famous hotel is the attentive, discreet service. We can’t spend a fortnight in a suite, but we could occasionally have a cocktail in the bar, mixed and served with polite panache.</p>
<p>Luxury exists around all kinds of objects. There are exceptional Old Master paintings, but there is also exceptional olive oil. Someone else might have a bespoke cashmere coat, but we might have a pair of silk socks. In terms of escalating costs, the high point of socks is reached much sooner than the high point in coats. The world’s best bread is within our grasp; the world’s best caviar may not be.</p>
<p>We misunderstand luxury when we see it as the self-indulgence of the rich or as the stroking of the egos of those who already have inflated views of their own worth. Luxury objects have a power to reassure us and make us feel, for a time, loved and appreciated, and they are often needed precisely because we feel crushed by existence. Luxury can matter because, in other areas of our lives, much has gone wrong, for reasons too complex to correct in any brief timescale. Our child may no longer look up when we greet them at breakfast; our spouse may be filled with resentments; our work may leave us in no doubt as to our idiocy and foolishness.</p>
<p>But, with one loaf of sourdough bread from an artisanal bakery or a tiny bottle of lavender bath oil from a shop in Provence, we have – for a little while – a kind of compensation for our woes. We are in the presence of something truly delightful; a portion of the kindness and consideration we crave, but hardly ever receive and may not quite deserve. Money obviously cannot buy us everything we truly want, especially the warm regard of those we love. But it can put us in contact with a few symbols of consideration and tenderness, which might be the very best we can hope for, and that is realistically available to us, in the radically imperfect circumstances of our lives. We may not always have the inner resources to find luxury uninteresting, but fortunately, in very minor doses, it is continually and surprisingly available to us as a source of consolation and uplift.</p>
