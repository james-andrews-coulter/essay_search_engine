        <h3>6 Huts</h3>
<p>Not coincidentally, many of the leading figures in the intellectual history of modernity have retreated to isolated dwellings in which to take distance from, and attempt to make sense of, the chaos: Nietzsche to a hut in the Swiss Alps, Wittgenstein to a hut in a Norwegian fjord, Heidegger to a hut in the Black Forest. Their writings may not have been typical, but their inner dislocations were. We may not have huts, but we sharply suspect how much we might need them.</p>
