        <h2>3.The Suspicion of Happiness</h2>
<p>Enjoying life is, in theory, deeply desirable, but we’d be wise to note how challenging it can be in reality – a fact with which our travels tend to confront us starkly. Suddenly, for a little while, by the pool or in the mountains, we may have nothing to do other than to be happy. The prospect can be truly alarming.</p>
<p>We tend to have three big fears:</p>
<p>i) If I settle back, throw away my cares for a time and enjoy what I have, I will lose the will to strive – which has been responsible for everything I have achieved to date.</p>
<p>ii) Enjoying beauty and comfort is selfish. There is, after all, simply so much suffering around.</p>
<p>iii) Enjoying life is not serious.</p>
<p>In Aesop’s famous fable, ‘The Grasshopper and the Ant’, all summer long, the ant labours away and when winter comes, she has enough food to survive. All summer long, the grasshopper enjoys herself – and is starving the next winter. The moral of the story is likely to have burnt itself into our consciousness from a young age. Relaxation can be dangerous.</p>
<p>But none of our three fears stand up to closer examination:</p>
<p>i) We can retain a sure hold on our striving-inducing dissatisfactions and, at the same time, occasionally savour the fragile harmony and beauty of a moment. In any case, unless we learn how to appreciate what we have, there is no point striving for more. Further gains are only worthwhile if our appreciative capacities are already functioning properly.</p>
<p>ii) Appreciation does not rule out compassion. Indeed, the more satisfied and rested we are, the more strength we have to bring to bear on the troubles of others. Being personally happy generates the best possible basis for helping to alleviate the griefs of strangers and friends.</p>
<p>iii) We don’t have to enjoy life the way the adverts tell us: we can carve out our own vision of pleasure, every bit as serious and dignified as we wish it to be.</p>
<p>We should go easy on ourselves for needing a little encouragement to accept a very unfamiliar situation: a few moments of happiness.</p>
