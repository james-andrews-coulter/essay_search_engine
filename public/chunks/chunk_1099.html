        <h2>The Nightclub</h2>
<p>In the late 1970s, an unusual figure became a central fixture in Manhattan’s premier nightclub, Studio 54 normally frequented by celebrities, models, the young and the powerful. Sally Lippman was a 90-year-old retired attorney who had been elected to the New York State Bar in the 1920s and had recently lost her husband. Unwilling to spend her last years in silent loneliness, she bought some tight trousers, high-top sneakers and black leather boots and went out four nights a week, in the process making a number of new friends and earning herself the nickname Disco Sally.
Nightclubs do not have a high reputation as therapeutic places. We associate them with grandstanding, a pressure to impress and a narrow group of initiates who intimidate the unfashionable and the ordinary. Most of us are held back from ever attending by a terror that we might be wearing the wrong clothes, that we might be too old or ugly and that we won’t know how to dance as we put it ‘properly’.
Disco Sally was wise enough not to let any such concerns inhibit her. She had lived long enough, suffered deeply enough and was close enough to death to know otherwise. She didn’t want to spend her last years in silence in her apartment and so dared to enquire about nearby clubs. Every culture in history, except for our own, has appreciated the need for all sections of society to gather regularly in order to lose themselves to a rhythmic beat. It’s been appreciated that, however rational we might manage to be the majority of the time, if we are to stay truly sane, we need to be given the chance to go mad at well-defined intervals.
However reasonable we may normally try to be, in the right sort of nightclub, we can take a break from logic and dignity and flail our arms and legs with gleeful, demented abandon perhaps, if we are lucky, with some characters in thongs and cartridge belts too.
We should be sensible enough to let folly have Its reign. We generally work so hard to ward off any suggestions that we might be daft, but one should accept that the effort was always likely to be in vain and contrary to the facts. We are, each one of us, thankfully, entirely idiotic, and it is a nightclub that gives us the licence to give visible expression to the madness we have repressed for too long and at too great a cost. We become properly serious when we can acknowledge a role for silliness. We mess around not because we think life is a joke, but precisely because we really know it isn’t.
As we dance, we break down the normal barriers between ourselves and others. Whatever separates us in terms of age or background can be overcome. We are all similarly ailing, frightened, vulnerable creatures who long for love and acceptance and are terrified of being excluded and judged. To the sounds of Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor, we can bathe in an atmosphere of compassion and kindness. We don’t need to go to an asylum to explore the split-off parts of our broken minds; we need only, with a gleeful swing of our hips and arms, to expunge our agonies on the dance floor.</p>
