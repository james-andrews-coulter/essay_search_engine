            <h3>Reputational failure</h3>
<p>Until it is under threat, it is easy to overlook what ‘reputation’ is or how desperately it matters. Reputation is made up of all the material that people who hardly know us resort to when judging us. It is the repository of all the random, semiconscious associations, prejudices and scarcely examined ideas that surround our names. The material may be inaccurate and casually compiled, but reputation still ends up determining the gospel truth about who we are for people who never have, and never will, give us an honest minute’s thought – that is, for almost everyone in the world. The other thing to note about reputation: it cannot be cleansed once it has been sullied.</p>
<p>For a long time in our lives, most of us lack a reputation of any kind. Our name is simply a blank. No one knows whether they should be pleased or appalled to meet us; the internet is silent about our identities. This is a momentous freedom – though it is rarely appreciated as such. Then, because of some superhuman moves on our part (unceasing efforts at work, remorseless networking, desperate attempts to generate publicity), we may start to develop a ‘good’ reputation. Positive associations begin to hover around our names; strangers may want to meet us. Our social circle becomes filled with people who like us chiefly because they are under the impression that other people like us.</p>
<p>Until one day we make a mistake – perhaps not a very large one, all things considered. We sleep with the wrong person, we send the wrong email, we lose our temper in the wrong place, we say the wrong thing online – and our reputation, carefully built up over three decades, falls apart in two hours. Like death (which it in many ways resembles), reputational extinction can happen in an instant. There are articles in the newspaper, rumours about us at parties – there may even be jeers in the street. Legions of people we didn’t even realise existed but who turn out to have been deeply offended by our success now gang up to accuse us of crimes way beyond those we actually committed. We are expelled from the group and sent into status exile.</p>
<p>We want – and may even begin – to protest. We try to put people right. Maybe we send letters pointing out that they have not judged us correctly; that they have got a few facts wrong here and there. We patiently try to explain that they haven’t fully grasped the way things look through our eyes. We might launch a court case in a bullish attempt to persuade them of another side to the story – or we might make a grovelling apology, give some money to a good cause, and hope for a second chance.</p>
<p>But we will soon realise that our efforts are entirely in vain. People aren’t getting us wrong for sensible reasons. They are generally doing it on purpose, to appease some historic sense of grievance, to assuage the pain of having themselves been overlooked for too long or to have a bit of fun because their own lives are filled with boredom, suffering and humiliation. Or they may hold on to the prevailing ideas about us because they can’t be bothered to do anything else; it’s just easier. They probably never thought seriously about us until now – and they’re not, in the middle of a scandal or a sacking, about to start to reflect deeply on our true character and the injustices of fate. They believed public opinion when we were supposedly marvellous, and they are happy to continue blithely to believe in it now that we are apparently unspeakable. It saves time.</p>
<p>Reputation is not something that can ever be ‘repaired’ because it is never properly built; it is merely a temporary assembly of wind and twigs. Yet public shaming is about as serious a wound as anyone can suffer. We are social creatures, hard-wired to care immeasurably about what others think of us; our antennae are perfectly attuned to notice how we are being perceived and when we have fallen foul of the community. We can’t help but be pained that – however complex and mitigating our true story is – we are condemned, for the rest of our lives, to be known only as ‘the criminal’, ‘the weirdo’, ‘the loser’ or ‘the pervert’.</p>
<p>If can feel like nothing we could ever do will be able to correct the mark on our names; we will never be able to reach into the minds of those who disparage us and alter the story that is unthinkingly summoned up whenever we are mentioned. A broken reputation forces us to do nothing less than give up on our relationship with most of the human race; it takes some practice, to say the least.</p>
