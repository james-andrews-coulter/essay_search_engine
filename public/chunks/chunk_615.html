        <h2>INDEPENDENCE OF MIND</h2>
<p>A good loving companion looking after a mentally sick friend heals through their power not to care very much about “what other people think.” Of course, out there, some people are sniggering. Of course, out there, some people judge and say that the illness isn’t legitimate or that it’s deserved and that the sufferer was awful to begin with. The good companion knows enough about the perversities of the human mind not to worry in the least when they encounter everyday prejudice and meanness; daftness is to be expected. The hasty judgments of thousands of people will, of course, be askew and lacking proper understanding. But that is no reason to panic or give up our original analysis. Let them laugh, let them feel superior, let the idiots be idiots: These are the consoling messages of love that we need to hear when we are defenseless before the judgments of an unkind world. Our loving companion knows where their loyalties lie and isn’t going to give up on us because a mob is jeering. They aren’t democrats when it comes to love. They don’t care if they are in a minority of one in cherishing us.</p>
