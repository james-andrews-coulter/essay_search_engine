        <h2>The Land of Cockaigne</h2>
<p>Throughout the medieval and early modern periods, one of the most popular travel destinations was the land of Cockaigne. It was sometimes believed to lie on an island below Spain; at other times, it was situated in the Caribbean. More usually its location was left pleasantly vague — though there was general agreement that the weather there was always mild and the flora and fauna perfectly suited to human needs (often, as here in the top right-hand corner, guinea fowl would fly right out of the sky and onto people’s plates for dinner).</p>
<p>According to one depiction produced by the Remondini printing firm in Italy in 1606, in Cockaigne money rained down from the sky, the lakes were filled with wine, crops harvested themselves, oxen ploughed fields unattended, the mountains were made of sugar, trees grew candied fruit, castles were fashioned out of gingerbread, streets were paved with pastry, ships were laden with pasta — and anyone who tried to do any work ran the risk of being arrested for disturbing the peace.</p>
<p>It might sound merely eccentric, but that would be to miss the significance and psychological importance of that much-neglected and unprestigious activity: day-dreaming. Our era thinks of dreams only as things we should conjure up in order to bring them to fruition through immense hard work. But that is to misunderstand what dreams are for. Our far wiser ancestors knew that many dreams have no chance of ever coming into being — but that we need to spend time with them nevertheless, in order not to go wild with frustration at our constricted conditions and the inevitable delays between desire and gratification. Dreams keep us going; they immerse us in more bearable scenarios so that we can return with greater strength to those obstacles we can’t, for now, avoid.</p>
<p>It is part of the genius of the way our brains are structured that we don’t necessarily need direct physical contact with things to derive their benefits. The thought alone can — sometimes — be enough. You can imagine a balmy afternoon in a field in Cockaigne and, for a moment, feel the sun’s reviving rays while hearing the distant sounds of a gurgling brook of Chianti or Barolo and anticipating eating a mattress-sized snack of panettone.</p>
<p>Our medieval ancestors knew very clearly where their dreams took them: towards food, warmth and rest. Whatever its fanciful excesses, the land of Cockaigne provides us with an only-too-real map of everything that was missing from their desperate lives. Different things will be missing from ours. Each of us has a land of Cockaigne in our mind already, even if we haven’t necessarily yet explored it or recognised it as such. When despair weighs on us, we should ask ourselves naive but critical questions: what’s Cockaigne for us? What do we want to gorge ourselves on? What would our lakes be filled with? What do we want to grow on trees? We should beware of surrendering our dreams too brutally or quickly in the name of realism or so-called maturity; daydreaming about what we really long for is a sensible way to get through the barren stretches.</p>
