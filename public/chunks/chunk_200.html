        <h2>3. The Big Relationships</h2>
<p>A Sand County Almanac, by Aldo Leopold (Oxford University Press, 1968) is regarded as a classic, and rightly so. By taking a passionate, practical and entertaining
  look at his local environment, Leopold demonstrates that it is not the detail that we find that makes a nature experience, but our approach. This book helped shape the environmental movement by
  eloquently proposing that anything that goes against the beauty or stability of an area is wrong. More subtly, it is an archetype for two nature philosophies: look and you will find; do and you
  will learn.</p>
