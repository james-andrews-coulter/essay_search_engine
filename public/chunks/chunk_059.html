        <h2>Parents</h2>
<p>We can be honest on this score: we all want divine versions of our parents. They would be solemn, dignified, patient and kind, always on hand to help and reassure – and, just as we might have hoped at the age of two or three, they would together know exactly what was going on and what needed to be done. If there was a problem, they would be on to it immediately. They would have the power to sort out all distress, and when we couldn’t cope, we could go to them and weep and they would stroke our hair and promise that things would be fine eventually. When we were sick, they would tuck us up in bed, bring a boiled egg with soldiers, and after a story, give us a kiss on the forehead and leave the door ajar so there would always be a bit of light and we wouldn’t have to be scared ever again.</p>
