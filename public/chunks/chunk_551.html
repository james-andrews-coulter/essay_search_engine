        <h3>¶ Art, The Purpose of</h3>
<p>The idea that art might not have a purpose is a relatively new one, emerging only in France in the middle of the 19th century. For the rest of history, in every established civilisation, it has seemed obvious that art has certain specific and important tasks to perform.</p>
<p>To summarise the objectives, the role of art has been: to give us a more accurate picture of the inner lives of other people; to show us what ‘normal’ really means and thus assuage our loneliness and shyness; to embolden the confession of our vulnerabilities by giving us greater confidence that others will understand; to console us in our sorrows; to draw our attention to pleasures we might otherwise overlook; to make important but not initially alluring ideas seductive and glamorous, so that we can more easily embrace them; to enlarge our sympathies for people who are not outwardly successful – not by making us feel guilty but by showing us what is genuinely admirable and attractive about them; and to take an ice pick to the frozen surface of our being and reconnect us with the deeper emotions on which our friendships, relationships and ambitions depend.</p>
<p>The key thing about art was identified by the Ancient Roman poet Horace: poetry (and art in general) should both ‘delight and instruct’. The combination is vital: there is so much in which we need to be instructed, but we will not learn unless we are delighted. The essential task of artists is to find the way to get round our boredom and our defences and entice us to pay serious attention to those ideas we need to keep at the front of our minds in order to live and die well.</p>
