        <h2>Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<p>One of the most frightening eventualities that may befall us – the trigger that more than any other has the power to catapult us into dread and self-doubt – is to succeed. To be promoted, praised, given a bigger salary, told that we are brilliant and awarded great responsibility. Success has an unparalleled capacity to generate terror, a longing to confess to one’s true mediocrity and a desire to run away.</p>
<p>Achieving little may well have its drawbacks: we feel belittled, overworked, mocked and disdained. But it spares us something far worse: having to disappoint others and be exposed as a fraud and a swindler. Inside the scared mind of the newly successful, a stream of tormenting thoughts is likely to roil: I don’t deserve this, I will be found out, I am not good enough. In the hours ahead of a speech, all we may think of is how unworthy we are of our listeners; at a company meeting, a sense of inadequacy pursues us after every one of our utterances. We may be tempted to crash our lives deliberately, not because we relish losing what we have got, but because success has robbed us of all peace of mind.</p>
<p>Success is commonly held up as a universal good, but it can only satisfy us in relation to our degree of self-love. Many of us long for success but do not know how to handle it. Nothing in our past may ever have led us to expect that we might one day be widely taken for decent, honourable, talented, intelligent or likeable people. Our childhoods may have left us with the firm impression that we must, at heart, be repugnant. Perhaps, long ago, our parents forcefully conveyed the idea that nothing we did could ever be acceptable, that we were ugly and disappointing, and another sibling was always the preferred option. From this, we will have developed into people with a deep conviction of our power to revolt anyone with a close understanding of our true natures.</p>
<p>This is what promises to unleash a crisis the moment that success comes our way. However momentarily pleasing a promotion or a new role may be, we have no option but to conclude that those who have approved of us must have done so on the basis of a mistake – which is bound, at some point, to be identified and then corrected. Though people in the vicinity may be complimenting us, though the applause appears sincere, the error is logically about to come to light. There has been a misunderstanding on a mass scale and soon enough, we’ll be accused of faking our accomplishments and defrauding our benefactors – and will face the righteous anger owed to all liars. No wonder we can’t sleep very easily. No wonder we can’t stop picturing the day when we are at last unmasked. No wonder we scour social media and scan the eyes of all those we meet for the first signs of the searing revelations about to break.</p>
<p>So unbearable can this tension prove, we might try to assuage it by unconscious attempts to eradicate the discrepancy between the kindly verdict of the world and our private sense of low self-worth. We may start to sabotage ourselves before others get around to spotting our lies. Maybe we fluff our speech, insult our boss or leave our work undone. Before too long, to our secret relief, we will have succeeded in engineering our own downfall. We will have failed, but at least we will no longer have to be so scared of the future.</p>
<p>Of course, there are better, kinder ways of resolving our impostor syndrome. For a start, by accepting what our childhoods never properly taught us: that we do not need to be flawless to deserve to succeed. We can be error-prone, worried and sometimes a little silly and still not be remotely fraudulent, for this is the way every human is constituted. There is no requirement to be impeccable in all areas in order to earn the right to exist, to be loved, to be accepted and to get a raise. We don’t have to hold ourselves to a standard that no one could ever reasonably be expected to meet. We must instead allow that if the world – that busy, cynical, bruised and ungenerous place – really seems to think we are good enough, then we should give ourselves the benefit of the doubt as well. Our real task is to go back and try to persuade the one audience that continues to mock us without cause: our demented inner critic, fashioned and schooled by the unrepresentative figures and experiences of early childhood.</p>
