        <h3>¶ Confidence</h3>
<p>The way to greater confidence is not to reassure ourselves of our own dignity; it is to come to peace with our inevitable ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots in the future – and that is okay. There aren’t any other available options for human beings.</p>
<p>We grow timid when we become too attached to an idea of our own seriousness and dignity, and are over-exposed to the respectable sides of others. Such are the pains people take to appear normal that we collectively create a phantasm – which hurts everyone – that normality and ongoing dignified competence might be possible.</p>
<p>But once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it doesn’t matter so much if we do one more thing that might look a touch stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual from whom we asked directions in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn’t be news; they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are nitwits.</p>
<p>The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially reduced. The fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to try things by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amid the endless disasters we’d have factored in from the outset, it would work: we’d get a kiss; we’d make a friend; we’d get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning, before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter much at all.</p>
