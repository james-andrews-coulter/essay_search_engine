            <h3>6. Envy</h3>
<p>Friendships that begin harmoniously when two people are at similar points in life are always vulnerable to the pressures of diverging fortunes: someone’s novel takes off; a business booms; a promotion is proffered. Or, conversely: a career flatlines; there’s a redundancy; a scandal breaks. The success of the one then becomes intensely resented by the other, who cannot look on their formerly equal friend’s new advantages without contortions of sickness. Far more than we’re usually prepared to admit, all friendships are at risk of envy.</p>
<p>In strongly individualistic and competitive societies, this can feel like a tragic truth. The highly successful and socially well-connected American essayist Gore Vidal once summarised the problem with legendary arch emphasis: ‘Whenever a friend of mine succeeds, a small part of me dies.’ The bleakness comes down to statistics: because the chances of one friend growing more successful over time than the other in some way must be close to 100%, all friendships are – in this disenchanted worldview – condemned gradually to wither.</p>
<p>The challenges are real, but they are not beyond thought or remedy. Firstly, we should never compound matters by assuming that envy might not exist, or wonder for too long whether we’re imagining that it might have arisen. Those silences, missing questions and distant looks mean exactly what we suspect they do. We shouldn’t presume that any bond might be without at least an important degree of this ubiquitous feeling.</p>
<p>And the reasons are self-evident. We tend to be friends with people who share our aspirations and values, and it is therefore highly likely that at some point along our journey together, either they will acquire something we very much want, or vice versa: it might be a partner, a profession, a qualification or a home. But it will be something for sure. We envy people for the same reason we are friends with them: because we like the same sorts of things.</p>
<p>We are unhelpfully inclined to be sentimental and therefore dishonest on this score: we deny that we could possibly harbour envy for someone we also like, which can lead us to unconvincing denials and cuts off opportunities for processing and growth. We need to learn to feel better about envy, in order not to have to twist our characters to avoid admitting to it.</p>
<p>We should, with reasonable good cheer, simply own up to our envy as we would to a sore knee or an ulcer. Children can be good guides in this area: an average 4-year-old is comedically open about their ravenous jealousy. They don’t contort themselves into knots in the name of politeness. They wail immediately when their friend gets a better fire truck – or try to hit them over the head or gouge out their eyes. Parents tend to be so shocked by this that they force the child into fruitless denials. They inspire them to hide their envy from two people: the person they’re envious of and, far worse, from themselves. They implicitly teach their offspring a pernicious and untrue idea: that you cannot both be a nice person and envy something your friend has. And therefore, tragically, in adult friendships, neither party is left able to call out the problem sensibly or deal with it maturely, leaving it to fester in embarrassment instead.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second solution to envy in friendships: we should go in for mutual playful, non-pejorative moments of confession. All good friends should – in an entirely good-natured way – routinely discuss the presence of envy between them. The question shouldn’t be whether or not there is envy, just what sort of envy it might be this week. Friends should, for example, over dinner each write on a sheet of paper: ‘What I am envious of now …’ and laugh with great compassion at the results.</p>
<p>An important part of the reason why we don’t process envy as we might is that we imagine there can be only one solution to the emotion: that the person who has something that their friend lacks will have to hand it over. But of course, we can’t be expected to surrender our partner, our house or our position nearer the top of the company to make a friend feel better. However, that’s not remotely necessary, because what the person who envies us really wants is not, in the end, our love life or accommodation or profession. What they want is reassurance. They want to know that we still love them despite our new advantages. They crave to be told that though we have won the lottery, sold our shares or found a dazzling lover, we remain deeply attached to them and care for them as much as we ever did.</p>
<p>Deep down, the pain of rivalry masks a fear of abandonment. When we are in the weaker position, our terror is that the other – in the glory of their new success – will stop caring about us. They’ll start to pity us, to look down on us and to want to shake us off. We’re no longer worthy in their eyes (we imagine) of close association with them. These are genuinely horrifying thoughts. But it’s crucial, at this moment of fear, to ask ourselves how we would feel about them if the situation were reversed. Suppose we ended up with a lot more money or prestige than them; would we relish making them feel hopeless? Would we want to crush them? On the contrary, we’d be rather desperate to make sure our friend knew as securely as possible that we saw them just as we always did, that we loved them for reasons that were unaffected by promotions or money. We then need to remember that if this is true of us, it will also be true of our friend. One person may have made a fortune by launching a business, the other may subsist on busking (let’s imagine), but between the two money is not the mark of worth; it is, as it always was, their conversations about books, childhood, the complexity of being alive, their responsiveness to nature and art, their sense of humour. True friends don’t take their cues from what others may think. They evaluate (and deeply respect) each other on a different – and far better – scale of values than that crudely utilised by markets and employers.</p>
<p>Another major defence that protects friendship from being eaten alive by rivalry is – oddly – pride. To feel the force of this idea we need to abstract, for a moment, from the particular relationship in which rivalry is rearing its head and think about our wider attitude to relationships. Suppose one day someone who is very impressive and successful were to get interested in us and extend an open and benign hand of friendship. We’d be deeply proud to count them amongst our closest companions. We’d relish that despite all the demands from the wider world and the great opportunities that constantly came their way, they wanted to talk and spend time with us; they wanted and valued our views and ideas; they liked and greatly appreciated who we were. This wouldn’t be humiliating; it would be wonderful. At root, this is no different from continuing to be a close friend to someone who achieves conspicuous success during the time of our acquaintanceship. We deserve to be proud of them, and – importantly – proud of ourselves for being friends with them.</p>
<p>Owning up to our true longing (and hearing it appeased) is devilishly hard for reasons we’re now in a position to appreciate: because the envious person can’t admit to what they’re feeling; because there aren’t generally any good occasions on which confessions can be made – and because we aren’t collectively schooled in the art of offering reassurance to others in the wake of our successes.</p>
<p>In a better world, we would take greater care. As a matter of course, every time something went well for us, we would be sure to add in ample reassurance that – despite our new status – we continued to love and cherish those we had long loved. We should stop worrying that there might be seams of envy entangled in our friendships and focus instead on a far more important goal: learning to handle envy with kindness, honesty and well-apportioned doses of warmth and humour.</p>
