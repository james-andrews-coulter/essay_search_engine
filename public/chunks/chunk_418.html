            <h2>Living with Permanent Infamy</h2>
<p>When search engines first came into prominence in the late 1990s, they promised to correct one of our minds’ greatest flaws: amnesia. It would no longer matter if we forgot the way back home, the name of the local hardware store or the date of Napoleon’s Russian campaign. The internet would have the missing information ready for us in milliseconds.</p>
<p>What most people overlooked, however, was that this relentless ability to remember everything – and forget nothing, even the B-side of a particular Beatles single, the name of Marcus Aurelius’s mother or the road from Ipswich to Lowestoft – would eventually have the power to trail and torment us into eternity if we were ever unlucky or foolish enough to err.</p>
<p>The internet has become an eternal charge sheet and bulletin board of every human being’s record of disgrace, failure and idiocy. Twenty years after an infraction, the internet still reminds everyone about what we did and how others judged it – and the misdemeanour is as shocking and disappointing as it ever was. It doesn’t matter if, in the intervening period, we have transformed our character, apologised to everyone involved, adopted a new religion or purged our soul. In the implacable opinion of the internet, we are fated to forever be our own worst moment – as captured by a journalist, or even just a passing stranger armed with a mobile phone and social media account, untrained in the empathetic methods of a Greek playwright. The curious barman at the hotel, the bank employee, the family at the next table – all are able to tap into their phone and know. We can never be a ‘nobody’ or even a ‘somebody quite nice’; we are always and forever the disgrace we once were.</p>
<p>As a society, we have over the years grown sensitive to the burden placed on individuals by prejudices and biases around race, gender and background. We have become aware of how crushing it is to disappear into a ready-made negative category in someone’s mind, and associate civilisation with a community in which everyone has the opportunity to escape summary and be discovered anew. It may sound obscene to compare the innocent victims of prejudice with the often-deserved opprobrium directed at those who have failed – yet we might at least propose that a civilised society should know when to curtail punishment. Just as we accept that there should be a prison ‘term’ – that after two or five or twenty-five years someone should have served their time – so we might propose that there should be a defined end to the punishment of infamy.</p>
<p>Yet if internet-enabled infamy remains lifelong, it’s partly because most of us fail to see it in the same way we would a prison sentence: we can intuitively understand why having to subsist in a bare, ugly cell should count as a severe chastisement, but we may never have taken the time to reflect on the distinctive burden constituted by infamy. We might even complain that someone who is merely mocked and shunned but has not gone to prison has got off lightly. Yet a moment of reflection should show us that infamy is very much its own burden and not a negligible one at that. As infamous people, we may, theoretically, be able to travel anywhere we like, but we will always be judged in the same entirely damning way. We will always be imprisoned within the negative assumption of others; we will never be able to spring open the door of the cage of suspicion and condemnation. And what’s worse, there will never be a judge who can say that now enough is enough; never a jury that will reconsider the facts and set us free. Infamous people are put in cells and the keys thrown away.</p>
<p>The punishment of the infamous is endless because it exists in a public mind that is continuously informed by the eternal memory of the internet – and that never sees any reason to doubt what it reads. After all, if this magical internet is able to summon the exact map coordinates we require or the precise cost of a new lamp, why would we ever doubt its ability to give us the correct information about the weirdo at the next table or the ridiculous candidate we were considering interviewing for a job. No counter-narrative can ever be built that will be powerful enough to control the floodwaters of damning online data. Shakespeare or Sophocles could write the finest drama about our fate, but for the average person with a phone we would still be the disgusting person who deserved every hateful comment accorded by a journalist twenty-two years ago.</p>
<p>It is worth registering this problem – but certainly not worth hoping for anything to change any time soon. Evolution here is measured in centuries. It took the better part of 1,000 years for humanity to realise that it was probably not a good idea to put people in stocks. In the medieval Netherlands, arriving late to church would result in one being draped in ‘stones of shame’ – large rocks linked by a heavy metal chain. In medieval Austria, spouses accused of being ‘argumentative’ were locked in a ‘shrew’s fiddle’, a portable pillory that locked the hands upwards in front of the face; an attached bell let the townspeople know that a ‘shrew’ was approaching so that they could run out of their homes and mock her. The good old days!</p>
<p>In the 14th–16th centuries, women across Europe could be disgraced for cuckolding or scolding their husbands, or for bearing an ‘illegitimate’ child. Punishment was often by the ‘cucking stool’ or ‘ducking stool’, a large wooden armchair fixed to a wooden arm over a lake or river; the accused would be ducked as many times as her alleged crime dictated. Often, she did not survive.</p>
<p>The most common form of public humiliation around this time was when a convicted criminal was restrained in a pillory (a wooden frame with holes for the head and hands) and displayed in a public place, where they could not hide from the jeers, abuse and rubbish that were thrown at them. The crowd were expected to demonstrate their disgust with the convict – if the crime was particularly heinous or offensive, they might have rotten eggs and slaughterhouse waste flung at them. For this reason, pillories were usually placed at the busiest site in a town or city – at the intersection of two major streets or roads, in the marketplace or town square, or in front of a church. In London in 1810, six men were pilloried for two days for ‘sodomy’; the City had to pay 252 constables to stand guard and protect them from an enraged mob, who nevertheless pelted the men with mud, dead cats, rotten eggs and vegetables, blood, offal and dung. The pillory remained a standard judicial sentence for sedition, homosexuality, extortion, fraud and perjury in Britain until 1837.</p>

<p>Numberless variations of these kinds of instruments of punishment were devised. The ‘scold’s bridle’ was designed to inhibit speech and feeding by means of a piece of metal that depressed the tongue, and it was commonly used in England and Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries as a ‘minor’ punishment for women found guilty of scolding or gossiping.</p>
<p>The jougs was an iron neck-collar and chain attached to a church wall, commonly used in Scotland. Those found guilty of offences like drunkenness, gossiping or missing church would be placed in the jougs and made to beg forgiveness from their neighbours passing in and out of the church.</p>
<p>In other words (lest we doubted it), we are a limitlessly judgemental species that appears to gain a lot of relief from our disappointments by hating others, without measure, for being ‘bad’. We should not add to our sorrows by imagining that we might be living in a forgiving world.</p>

<p>The good news is that we are also highly adaptable. We love having two legs, but, if fate were to decree it, we’d end up being able to get by on one. It’s very nice not to have to sit in urine-stained underpants, but you can tell someone they need their bladder removed and they’ll generally keep living and be grateful for the chance to do so. It’s nice to speak, of course, but people can and will endure having their voice box removed and having to talk through an electronic replacement. Possibilities that seem hugely difficult to cope with from a distance have a habit – once we have to go through them – of proving survivable. It’s not what we would have chosen, for sure, but we cope. We may be the person who everyone in the community hates and mocks and thinks evil, but we can take it. Every time we walk into a room, we can be sure that ninety-eight per cent of the people there are sniggering – and yet we hold on to reasons to keep living.</p>
<p>That’s the level of pain we need to be ready for.</p>
<p>There are upsides to amnesia. If we can allow ourselves to forget, we can also cease to torture ourselves with comparisons between what we once had and what we have now. We won’t remember or dwell too much on what it was like to have two legs or a functioning bladder or a name that wasn’t dirt. We can inhabit the present; the past is another country whose outlines can be left to grow blessedly vague.</p>
<p>When we are infamous, very few people will want to talk to us. Our interactions with ‘most people’ will be sharply curtailed. It is at this point that we will discover that the only people whose time and interest we can really hold out for are those who know about something that is widely esteemed but almost never understood: love.</p>
