        <h3>¶ Inner Voices</h3>
<p>We all have Inner Voices in our minds. They talk to us as we try to achieve things or deal with our lives. Sometimes they are kind, but often they are punitive, telling us we’re stupid or worthless or that we deserve every misfortune that comes our way.</p>
<p>An Inner Voice was always once an outer voice that we have imperceptibly made our own. Perhaps we have absorbed the tone of a harassed or angry parent; the menacing threats of an elder sibling keen to put us down; the contempt of a schoolyard bully, or the words of a teacher who seemed impossible to please. We take in these voices because, at certain key moments in the past, they sounded compelling and irresistible. The dominant figures of our individual histories repeated their messages over and over until they became lodged in our own way of thinking – sometimes to our great cost.</p>
<p>The ideal Inner Voice doesn’t pretend that everything we do is wonderful. Rather, it is like the voice of an ideal friend. These figures can recognise when we have done something unwise, but they are merciful, fair, accurate in understanding what’s going on and interested in helping us deal with our problems. It’s not that we should stop judging ourselves; the hope is that we can learn to be better judges of ourselves.</p>
<p>Instead of promoting a self-flagellating critical internal commentary, a good friend represents a calm, constructive way of addressing failings.</p>
<p>Culture has a role to play here. If our surrounding culture is broadcasting voices that are at once realistic and supportive, complex and morally perceptive, it will be much easier for us to adopt this manner internally as we comment on the trickier parts of our own lives. External generous wisdom can take up residence in the place it is most needed: our private running conversation with ourselves.</p>
