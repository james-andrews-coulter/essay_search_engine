        <h2>10. WHO IS REJECTING WHOM?</h2>
<p>When a relationship ends, we expect it to be fairly easy to determine who ended it and who wished it to continue. The person who said they wanted out, who explicitly called for the breakup, who bought a new apartment and who might be on the search for a new partner is evidently the one who ended things; and the one who proposed remaining together, who argued for giving it another shot and who said loudly that they had no wish to break up is just as evidently the one who remained loyal.</p>
<p>But this may be a naïve and unwittingly cruel view of how relationships can end. In reality, it isn’t necessarily the one who leaves who is doing the rejecting, nor the one who ostensibly seeks to remain who is the one being rejected. Not everyone who leaves hates, and not everyone who stays loves. The person who really ‘leaves’ is the one who withdraws affection. And the one who really ‘remains’ is the one who believes in closeness with a partner, even if the frustration of this belief can end up causing this person to quit.</p>
<p>Beneath the distinction between leaving and staying lies a more important distinction: between love and indifference. Although one could imagine that leaving would go with indifference and staying would go with love, there are cases where a person seeks to keep a relationship going and yet acts in a subtly indifferent or covertly hostile manner towards their partner. They may clearly claim that they don’t want things to end. But to the profound puzzlement of the partner, their day-to-day behaviour expresses something rather different; their manner may be distant, their caresses few, their physical attentions negligible.</p>
<p>This doublespeak can drive the partner to extreme confusion and even the brink of a breakdown, for they will be told that what they long for is available even as the practical evidence points to the contrary. There is always a reason why it’s too late for sex or a hand isn’t there to hold – but to complain is invariably to meet with anger and denial or promises of a brighter future next time. Not only is the partner being neglected, they are made to feel insane for suggesting they might be so.</p>
<p>Eventually, worn down by the dissonance between word and deed, the emotionally ignored party may lose their patience and declare that they are off, not because they truly want to be, but because they’ve been forced to conclude that their partner will never be able to assuage their needs. They are leaving not because they don’t love, but because the love they have to give doesn’t feel as if it will ever be answered.</p>
<p>It is a particular burden when a person not only has to bear the sadness of being turned down, but also has to carry the guilt of having ended the relationship in the face of a host of protestations of loyalty by their covertly cold partner. To spare themselves the ravages of selfhatred, the departing lover should daily rehearse in their mind how they got to this place. As they head for the door, their truth is not ‘I am leaving you because I hate you’, but ‘I am leaving you because I love you so much and have tried so hard, too hard, to elicit a matching love that never felt available.’</p>
<p>Such an awareness won’t dull the pain, but it will repatriate emotions and lessen an unfair burden of responsibility. One is leaving, perhaps, but one simultaneously deserves all the sympathy and compassion due to someone who has, at heart, been gruesomely – and surreptitiously – rejected.</p>
