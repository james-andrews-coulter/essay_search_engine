        <h2>THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE PAST</h2>
<p>Small children are incomparable learning machines, picking up language, motor skills, and social skills at an exponential rate in their early months and years. They are wholly porous to their environment so that they can learn French and European table manners in Paris and Inuit and fishing techniques in Iqaluit. But it’s this very porousness that also makes them perilously vulnerable to the emotional peculiarities of their host families. We generalize outward from dubious premises. One particularly difficult father or mother can shape our expectations of men or women over a lifetime. Being emotionally neglected by a distracted parent can instil a lasting sense of worthlessness which no amount of later attention or fame can easily contradict. Fear of a volatile parent’s temper can mold a whole personality in the direction of meekness and compliance.</p>
<p>The therapist’s role is to incite the patient to get curious about the strangeness and partiality of their introduction into the world. What they might have believed was “normal” was in fact the result of a very particular, and problematic, set of circumstances. We are granted the right to question the sanity of our early caregivers and, in the process, to recover some of our own.</p>
<p>We may have inherited a script from childhood that dictates that we should only ever fall in love with people who leave us emotionally unfulfilled, or that we should start to panic that we will be attacked and humiliated the moment we do well professionally. Our script may tell us that no one will understand if we level a complaint against them or if we betray anyone on whom we have come to depend.</p>
<p>A therapist can open our eyes to how we may be following a script simply because it feels familiar, not because it is rational or in any sense connected to our satisfaction, and thereby offer us a chance to invent newer and more satisfying ways to lead our lives.</p>
