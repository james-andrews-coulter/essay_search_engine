        <h3>1. Intuition vs Analysis</h3>
<p>Romantics relish the ways love can seem slightly to defy rational explanation. They are enthusiastic about feelings and wary of the intellect as a guide to life. They like the notion that you just know by instinct that someone is right for you, or that your feelings simply tell you that a relationship is over. In their eyes, it is cold and even a bit cruel to probe a decision or a mood too hard. In particular, they think one shouldn’t strive to take apart emotions. They have a deep respect for high-flown vague language and obscure modes of expression, which seem to them to hint at valuable yet ineffable aspects of love and closeness. They don’t think it’s a particularly good idea to draw up lists of pros or cons or try to spell out exactly what may be going well or badly in a relationship.</p>
<p>Classicists, on the other hand, are wary of intuition. They tend to have learned, often through bitter experience, how misguided and deluded their own feelings may be and hence look rather sceptically and caustically upon them. They see no conflict between loving someone and asking probing questions about why they do. They favour clear modes of expression (even about rare and evanescent emotions, like looking into their partner’s eyes) and like language that an intelligent twelve-year-old could understand.</p>
