        <h2>LONELINESS</h2>
<p>We could not in the past survive without the clan or group. Our natural frailty meant that we would need to lean on the family and community in order to survive. It made for oppression at points, but it also spared us modernity’s recurrent risks of alienation.</p>
<p>We have grown ever more capable of subsisting without others. We can endure for days in cities of 10 million people without uttering a word. Yet we have lost the art of admitting our sorrows to others and of building connections based on vulnerability. We are lucky if we can lay claim to even one or two people we can call on when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Our age attempts to cure loneliness through romantic love with the promise that we may, each of us, find one very special person to whom we can tie ourselves for life and who will spare us the need for anyone else. But this emphasis serves only to aggravate our isolation and renders our relationships more fractious than they should be, for no single person, however extraordinary, can ever replace our need for a more broadly based circle of support. We fail to bring the most important parts of ourselves to our friendships; we starve ourselves of the solace and salvation of the many in a misguided search for the one.</p>
