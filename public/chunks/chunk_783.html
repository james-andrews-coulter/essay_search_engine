        <h2>COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>Every time we share a piece of our pained inner self with a like-minded friend, we defend ourselves against despair and self-hatred. This should matter to us far more than whether we have found one special romantic partner. What we need is a network of non-judgmental souls who have known enough of their own suffering to be ready to show us compassion and tenderness when we stumble.</p>
