        <h3>¶ Closeness</h3>
<p>Even after years with someone, there can be a hurdle of fear about asking for proof that we are wanted – but with a horrible, added complication: we now assume that any such anxiety couldn’t possibly exist. This makes it very difficult to recognise our insecure feelings, especially if they have been triggered by a so-called ‘small’ matter, let alone communicate them to others in ways that would stand a chance of securing us the understanding and sympathy we crave. Rather than requesting reassurance endearingly and laying out our longing with charm, we might instead mask our needs beneath some brusque and hurtful behaviours guaranteed to frustrate our aims. Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, two major symptoms tend to show up.</p>
<p>Firstly, we may become distant – or what psychotherapists call ‘avoidant’; we disguise our need for our lover.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may become controlling – or what psychologists term ‘anxious’; we disguise our vulnerability behind an officious front.</p>
<p>The solution is to normalise a new and more accurate picture of emotional functioning: to make it clear just how healthy and mature it is to be fragile and in repeated need of reassurance, especially around sex. We suffer because adult life posits too robust a picture of how we operate. It tries to teach us to be implausibly independent and invulnerable. It suggests it might not be right to want a partner to show us they still really like us after they have been away for only a few hours. Or to want them to reassure us that they haven’t gone off us, just on the basis that they didn’t pay us much attention at a party and didn’t want to leave when we did.</p>
<p>Yet it is precisely this sort of reassurance that we constantly need. We are never through with the requirement for comfort. This isn’t a curse limited to the weak and the inadequate. In this area, insecurity is a sign of well-being. It means we haven’t allowed ourselves to take other people for granted. It means we remain realistic enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly, and are invested enough to care.</p>
<p>We should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. ‘I really need you; do you still want me?’ should be the most normal of enquiries. We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and punitively macho term ‘neediness’. We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind some of our and our partner’s most frosty, managerial or distant moments.</p>
