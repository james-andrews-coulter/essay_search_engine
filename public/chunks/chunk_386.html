            <h2>2. How We Got Here</h2>
<p>For the detailed history of the later period of Rome there is the famous (and enormous) The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon
  (published in six volumes between 1776 and 1781). He was perhaps the first serious historian to blame the fall of Rome on Christianity, which he thought made Romans ‘effeminate’.</p>
<p>A more contemporary approach to the specific issues I have been looking at can be found in the works of Professor Peter Brown (of Princeton), who has specialized in the religious culture of the
  later Roman Empire and early mediaeval Europe. He writes in a way that is wonderfully accessible as well as scholarly. Among his relevant books are: Augustine of Hippo: A Biography
  (University of California Press, 1967); The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity (Columbia University Press, 1988) and most recently Through the
  Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350–550 AD (Princeton University Press, 2012).</p>
<p>The Eagle of the Ninth Chronicles (OUP, 2010) is a trilogy of children’s novels by Rosemary Sutcliff, set in Roman Britain. The third of the series – The Lantern
  Bearers – is an extremely moving account of the resistance to the Saxon invaders after Rome pulled the legions out of Britain to defend the imperial city itself. It addresses the
  conflict of values and the sense of devastation and cultural unhinging – on all sides – as the Empire declined and broke up.</p>
<p>In Britain at least thirty-six of our present towns and cities, including London, have Roman foundations. Visits to the Roman Baths in Bath (hence the city’s name) and the Amphitheatre in
  Chester both offer a powerful impression of the high value of public and civic life even at the furthest ends of the Empire. A trip that takes in both Hadrian’s Wall (and its associated
  artefacts) and Lindisfarne (the Holy Island) or the Farne Isles, where St Cuthbert (c. 634–687) had his hermitage, shows the contrast between the two ideals very sharply (while also providing
  some beautiful empty terrain for solitary walking).</p>
<p>The Romantic movement in Britain is best known through its poets: William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats are perhaps the key names.
  Wordsworth was the most articulate about the value of solitude and its crucial importance to artists. It is a central and continuing theme of his work. For him solitude in nature was essential to
  creative inspiration. He has had immeasurable influence on the poetic ideal ever since. His poetry is still widely read and accessible. He is especially associated with the Lake District
  (Cumbria).</p>
