        <h3>Voluntary retirement</h3>
<p>In our pursuit of serenity, we should understand the connection between money, power and renown on the one hand, and our reserves of calm on the other. We must not imagine that we can ever add more of the former without decreasing the latter. We can certainly design a life where we fill our coffers, are recognised by strangers and are invited to seemingly important occasions – but we must recognise that we will also, by necessity, be increasing the amount of panic and paranoia in our lives. We should dare to retire voluntarily from an active or elite life – in order to enjoy the true wealth afforded by a serene mind.</p>
