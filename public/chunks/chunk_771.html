        <h2>SORROW FOR OURSELVES</h2>
<p>We may learn that we are ill because we have been brave for far too long. We have not been allowed to fully appreciate the difficulties we navigated—a depressed parent, a jealous sibling, a bullying classmate—and so have not shown ourselves the compassion and sorrow we have always been owed. We may need to cry long and hard about the past until the present ceases to seem so universally dark.</p>
