        <h2>Time</h2>
<p>When it’s just happened, our failure hurts so much because the memory of what we have lost is so vivid. We remember what it was like the previous summer – when we could still look forward to a prosperous future, when we were still being invited out, when we had some money and could sleep. During this time, we are continually tortured by the difference between what is and what might have been. If only we had been more careful with the document, if only we had listened to reason, if only we hadn’t been so greedy, thoughtless, arrogant, lustful or vain …</p>
<p>But the more the situation settles, the more we start to appreciate – with mature darkness – that there were some rather weighty reasons why things unfolded as they did. We were greedy, thoughtless, arrogant, lustful or vain not by random chance, but for reasons that run deep in our characters. We may not like the flowers that emerged, but the roots of these plants run many metres down and would almost certainly have manifested themselves somewhere, at some point, perhaps in even less propitious ways.</p>
<p>What seems to have happened by – we initially think – a totally avoidable piece of ill luck emerges over time as a phenomenon with a firm, albeit grim, logic. Failure wasn’t merely a coincidence or happenstance. The constituents of failure are as much part of us as the imprints of our fingers. We can’t lean across to an adjoining table and wish we could have this bit of a more accomplished friend’s life or that portion of a stranger’s good fortune. We have to pay allegiance to who we actually are – in all zones of life, of which failure is in the end just one.</p>
<p>We will also, fortunately, start to forget. The alternative narrative in which we did not fail will grow ever more distant. We won’t remember the way that the next year was supposed to go. We will forget what it was like to go to parties. We won’t recognise the names of our enemies. As the months and years pass, what should not have happened will turn into what had to happen.</p>
<p>We will have had to fail – and then we will have learnt – in other areas, remarkably, in ways we had never expected and that still feel alien and impossible now – how to win.</p>
