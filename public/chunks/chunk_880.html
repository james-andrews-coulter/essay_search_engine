        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>1.     Let yourself be as finickety as a music critic or as particular as an interior designer. What little details of your partner’s behaviour grate on you? Make the longest, most detailed list you can, covering issues like routines, timekeeping, levels of cleanliness, varieties of laughter and taste in socks, childhood friends and breakfast cereals.</p>
<p>2.     Go through the list and try to explain why these things bother you, with reference to your past. Be as explicit as possible: what is it in your history that has been offended by these often unobtrusive ideas and behaviours?</p>
<p>3.     Suggest that your partner make, very nicely, the same kind of complaints against you, for things that you could not easily have imagined would upset them. Ask them to explain what parts of their history are being engaged: how are you ‘frightening’ them?</p>
