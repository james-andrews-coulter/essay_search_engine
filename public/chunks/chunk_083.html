        <h2>‘You’re a total loser’</h2>
<p>There is never one story of a life. The difference between hope and despair hangs on a different way of telling contrasting stories from the same set of facts. Of course you could spin everything as a tragedy; of course there’s enough material for a suicide. But let’s try another route. This is another way of telling your life story: ‘Against enormous odds, you attempted to live decently; you made some serious errors, as all humans will, and you paid a very heavy price for them. In many ways, you suffered far more than is your due. You’ve been through hell. Nevertheless, you tried to be good and loved a few people properly and attempted to keep going.’ On your gravestone, it might say: ‘Tried very hard’. Or: ‘Despite everything, heart was in the right place’. And that would be a far kinder and equally valid way to narrate a life.</p>
