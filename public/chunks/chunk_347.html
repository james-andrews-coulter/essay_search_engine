            <h3>3 Ataraxia</h3>
<p>The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spent seven summers — in 1881 and again between 1883 and 1888 — in the high Alpine village of Sils Maria in the southeast corner of Switzerland. He rented a room in a modest farmhouse where, far from the crowded cities and turbulent urban passions that he feared, he wrote some of his most famous works, including The Gay Science, Thus Spake Zarathustra and Twilight of the Idols.</p>
<p>He would get up very early and write until early afternoon, at which point he would go out for a two- to three-hour walk — which was where he grew familiar with the grey-brown mountain cattle known as the Braunvieh. Groups of them were to be found in most pastures, and Nietzsche fell in love with them.</p>
<p>He was fascinated by the patient, wise-looking way they dealt with their often less-than-ideal lives. They showed no impatience or anger. They didn’t appear to suffer from envy or regret missed opportunities. They seemed to harbour no plans for revenge or cower fearfully from the future. They behaved calmly in rain and sunshine, when flies landed on their noses and their heavy bells chafed their necks.</p>
<p>Nietzsche felt that they had reached the state of calm and equanimity that had been the goal of all philosophy for the ancient Stoics, a frame of mind known to the Greeks as ‘ataraxia’. They might not have read much Zeno or Seneca, but they were true philosophers. Nietzsche gave the Braunvieh a starring role in his own philosophy in Thus Spake Zarathustra: ‘Unless we change (or be converted) and become as cows,’ he wrote, ‘we shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.’</p>
