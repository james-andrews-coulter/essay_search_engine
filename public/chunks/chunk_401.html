        <h3>The contemporary world</h3>
<p>Work is our new religion. We are the sum total of our achievements. We could always be doing something more. At the same time, possibilities for distraction have increased exponentially. The internet is necessary for almost every activity but is – by a tragic error – the richest source of distraction ever invented. The most ambitious, insightful minds on the planet strive ceaselessly to entice us towards novel ways of amusing ourselves when we should be working – opportunities for procrastination are massively multiplied and pushed widely and deeply into our lives. Employment is insecure; any failure can be fatal. There is pressure to justify our existence every day. Procrastination becomes a central secular sin, the intimate revelation of a lack of fitness for life; yet the inducements to, and opportunities for, procrastination are at an all-time high. Dentistry and plumbing are excellent, but with respect to work, we deserve genuine pity and tenderness for having the misfortune to be born into this phase of world history.</p>
