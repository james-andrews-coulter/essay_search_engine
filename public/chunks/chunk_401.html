        <h3>Romantic failure</h3>
<p>Astonishingly, we are still inclined to trust that relationships might somehow be the fun, sweet, exciting and endearing bit of life. Let’s be clear: there is no faster route to destroying ourselves than through love and sex. There is no more effective way of turning otherwise sensible and balanced lives into tragedies than through engagement with our romantic and sexual drives.</p>
<p>No wonder people are nervous on first dates – they should be a lot more so (especially if the date goes ‘well’). The chances of getting through our sex lives unscathed are negligible. No one properly informs us of the risks. There are no warning signs, extensive training programmes, hazard lights and alarms. We don’t employ masked figures to wail and intone when adolescence begins. It’s like the mouth of an active volcano left without guard rails. There is nothing like the requisite solemnity or fear. Yet so much predisposes us to fail.</p>
<p>For one, we have a hopelessly fragile understanding of our own minds and needs. We can’t grasp what we’re after and what we should resist. Sex is in permanent conflict with emotional priorities. It’s impossible for us to recognise the ways in which our underlying disturbances affect who we can desire – and what unfortunate and reckless choices we continually make due to the imprint of our childhood psyches. It can take a decade to work out that we have landed on a person exquisitely designed to provoke our worst responses. For a while, we may get away with it. No one gets seriously hurt – there aren’t any children, there’s no money involved, no one else cares. But our luck will only hold out for so long. Gradually, we assemble the ingredients for our own disaster: a slightly compromised marriage, a somewhat damaged psyche, a handful of children, a sprig of boredom, an ounce of jealousy, maybe an affair, some financial wranglings, a divorce, a judgemental society … In the end, we don’t need to do very much wrong in the romantic field to end up involved in horror.</p>
