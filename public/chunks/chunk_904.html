        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>With such darkness in mind, we would be readier to bless our fortunes in whatever increments they came. If we had spent a pleasant afternoon together, we would know to say thank you. We’d take nothing for granted about a five-day break that had unfolded without crisis. We would think we were doing well if we could celebrate our second anniversary and still want to make love or like getting home early to spend extra time in the beloved’s arms. What immense good fortune to be calling them ‘sweet pea’ or ‘baby lamb’ after a decade. A genuinely considerate comment would become something precious; an apology that was properly meant would be a triumph (even if we knew the same problem would doubtless resurface before long).</p>
<p>As part of this gratitude, we’d do a lot more investigating; every sigh would get attention. We wouldn’t assume that a partner wasn’t planning an affair or a chat with a divorce lawyer. We’d regularly ask them if they were angry with us or wanted something else – and would listen very carefully to the answers. We’d repeatedly apologise for existing – and hope that they would, with equal humility, do much the same.</p>
