        <h3>Realise our vulnerability</h3>
<p>We should acknowledge how vulnerable our moods are to being perturbed by so-called ‘small things’. We belong to a species of extreme but also fateful sensitivity; we shouldn’t expect to be able to appreciate a Mozart aria on the one hand and then, on the other, stay unbothered by the downturned corners of the mouth of a lover. We shouldn’t berate ourselves for how thin our skin is; we should adjust ourselves to the full consequences of our extraordinary openness to experience.</p>
