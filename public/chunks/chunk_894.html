        <h3>The Standard Model totalises</h3>
<p>To get a perspective on one drawback of the Standard Model, we can try a thought experiment. Imagine a society that’s long been devoted to a sporting event in which every competitor has to run a race, then lift some weights, swim, do the pole vault, ride a horse, last five rounds in a boxing ring and finally scale a climbing wall. It’s not considered proper to do any of these things separately; everyone must do all of them.</p>
<p>To outside observers, this might seem a hugely bizarre system: why don’t they just let people choose which bit, or bits, they want to specialise in? Why should wanting to swim entail entering the boxing ring? Similar questions could be raised of the Standard Model of relationships and its multiple, interconnected requirements. Why should sharing domestic tasks involve sleeping in the same bed? Why should merging finances be twinned with going on holiday together?</p>
<p>To help us notice our own tastes, we might go through the different elements combined in the Standard Model, one by one, and privately rate how significant each one might actually be to us.</p>
<p>Activity</p>
<p>Not important</p>
<p>Could be important</p>
<p>Definitely important</p>
<p>Always sleeping in the same bed</p>
<p>Sharing all domestic tasks absolutely equally</p>
<p>Spending nearly every evening and every weekend together</p>
<p>Having children</p>
<p>Holidaying together</p>
<p>Being sexually exclusive</p>
<p>If we haven’t been able to tick every entry in the ‘definitely important’ column, we are on the way to being a Standard Model rebel. Thought-provokingly, a great many of us already are.</p>
