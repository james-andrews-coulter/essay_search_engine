        <h2>PRESENTS</h2>
<p>The guests shouldn’t just give a present; they should accompany it with an account of why their own marriage or relationships are difficult and why they are themselves awkward people to live with. The new couple will (at some point) be tormented by the idea that their relationship is especially difficult and strange. Nothing makes us happier than news of the troubles of others, as notes accompanying the presents should implicitly recognise.</p>
<p>At dark moments in the marriage, one can turn to these gifts and flip through descriptions of the marital troubles of friends and relatives – and come away feeling that one is cursed certainly, but – importantly – in no way alone.</p>
<p>If single guests are unable to produce such things, they should arrive with vouchers for couples’ therapy, to contribute to the enormous sum that will have to be spent on therapy over the lifetime of any decent marriage.</p>
