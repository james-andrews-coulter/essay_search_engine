        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This book describes the arc of a journey—from breakdown and collapse to convalescence and recovery. It is intended as both a practical guide and a source of consolation and friendship during what might be some of our loneliest, most anguished moments.</p>
<p>This is a book about getting unwell, imagining that we have let everyone down—and losing direction and hope. It’s also a book about redemption: about regaining the thread, rediscovering meaning, and finding a way back to connection, warmth, and joy.</p>
<p>It’s a book interested in sympathy, endurance, and how to build a life where, despite everything, we are once again sure we want to be here.</p>
<p>This is, ultimately, a book about resilience. It insists that we cannot allow terror, self-hatred, and sadness to have their victories over us and that we can always, so long as we think matters through with sufficient creativity and gentleness, identify reasons to live.</p>
<p>It can be easy to wonder for too long what books and ideas might be for. Their highest calling, which inspires what follows, may simply be to try to lend us—at our very worst moments—the strength and clarity to endure.</p>
