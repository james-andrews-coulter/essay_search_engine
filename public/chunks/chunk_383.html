        <h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
<p>I chose to write this book back-to-front. It is more usual with this sort of ‘handbook’ to begin with all the glories and delights of your subject and only move on
  to the problems and more negative details once you have whipped your readers up into a state of joyful anticipation. I’ve done it the other way round. This is because, although I myself love
  being alone and want other people to enjoy it more, I am very aware that this is a bit countercultural in our present society. So I decided to get all the negative stuff out of the way first and
  keep the benefits and delights of solitude until those that needed it were reassured and so that readers could finish the book on a joyful high.</p>
<p>There are many joys of solitude but in this book I have outlined those that seem to me the most obvious and open to everyone’s experience. If even one of these five rewards or benefits of
  being alone has content for you – and it generally appears that in fact they come together to a considerable extent – then it is worth overcoming any fears or doubts you may have about
  embracing the freedom and at the very least trying out some personal solitude and seeing what happens. It is an adventure.</p>
