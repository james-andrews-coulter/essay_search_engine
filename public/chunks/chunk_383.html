        <h3>Media</h3>
<p>Keeping a screen permanently to hand that can inform us of every latest piece of nastiness, folly, envy and anger at large in the world poses an existential threat to the mind – and is a fast route to madness for anyone of fragile disposition. We are far too delicately constituted to be able to blithely read salacious accounts of yet more murders, divorces or business failures – and then hope to get on with our day with our spirits remotely intact. If we are to remain even somewhat balanced, limiting our contact with, and knowledge of, the actions and beliefs of most members of the human race will be a daily priority.</p>
