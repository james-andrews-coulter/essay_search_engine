        <h3>3. When we realise we are crazy</h3>
<p>This is deeply counter-intuitive. We seem so normal and mostly so good. It’s the others …</p>
<p>But maturity is founded on an active sense of one’s folly. One is out of control for long periods, one has failed to master one’s past, one makes unhelpful ‘transferences’, one is permanently anxious. One is, at best, a loveable idiot.</p>
<p>If we are not regularly and very deeply embarrassed about who we are, it can only be because we have a dangerous capacity for selective memory.</p>
