        <h1>The Nun Study</h1>
<p>In his book Aging With Grace, David Snowden describes his long-term study of nuns. He undertook the study in order to examine longevity and incidences of dementia. He was also interested in links between the nuns’ brain health and factors like intelligence and diet. His subjects provided an ideal opportunity to study the effect of education on long functioning life because the living circumstances of the nuns, in terms of exercise, diet, routine and financial circumstances, were similar, thus making education a measurable distinction between them.</p>
<p>In this study, Dr Snowden noticed that, while some nuns had mentally deteriorated so far that they could no longer live independently or feed themselves, others at the same age or older were still holding down full-time jobs. He found that the nuns who had university degrees had significantly longer, independent, functioning lives than those who had ended their education earlier. And the longer they continued to study, or embark upon and maintain new interests, the more lively their minds seemed to stay.</p>
<p>With another researcher, Jim Mortimer, Snowden also studied ‘brain reserve’. They suggested that a brain that has been actively used in socializing and learning all through life builds more neural connections than a brain that has been less stimulated. So, in the former case, when part of the brain is damaged by Alzheimer’s, the pathway is not necessarily permanently interrupted, but can find a new route around the tangle or plaque caused by the disease. Snowden and Mortimer also found that some nuns who displayed no signs of Alzheimer’s when alive were found to have significant damage caused by it at autopsy, whereas the brains of those who clearly exhibited the condition in life had fewer signs of it when autopsied. Snowden and Mortimer have not yet come to any firm conclusions about the part continuing curiosity and learning plays in building up brain reserve, but circumstantial evidence suggests a connection.</p>
<p>Good stress keeps our brains plastic. A plastic brain can adapt, stay flexible, remain connected to community, and cope with the inevitable changes that life brings. Good stress motivates us by activating our curiosity, firing our enthusiasm and feeding our creativity.</p>
<p>The hormone dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in reward-reinforcement. We can stimulate its production in both healthy and unhealthy ways. The form of dopamine stimulation that I advocate is learning something new, and the thrill that comes with it – whether mastering a new musical instrument, succeeding with a new recipe, shooting a ball into a basket or learning to tell a successful joke. Dopamine production is also stimulated by addictive substances or activities, such as gambling. This is an abuse of dopamine and by using it this way we can overload our systems, causing health and emotional problems. Pleasure is good for us but feeding an addiction is not.</p>
<p>If we are, for instance, hard-working university researchers, we might consider that we are already doing enough learning. It is true that our neural pathways for research will be well developed; but learning how to dance the tango, cook a tagine or speak a new language will supply us with the good stress that builds more brain reserve. However, we need certain conditions for brain building. We must be doing something genuinely new, and we must pay close attention, be emotionally engaged and keep at it. New pathways will form if two or more of these conditions are met, but we will ideally meet all four at once.</p>
<p>Less challenging but also useful are the solo activities sometimes referred to as ‘brain training’ – such as crosswords, word search games and card games such as solitaire and patience – games that appear to be of limited value as transferable skills. For example, when we learn and practise Sudoku, we get better at Sudoku, but it has limited value that we can integrate into the rest of our life. In fact, as a Sudoku-and-other-numbers-games addict, let me offer a word of warning about such ‘brain’ games. I have noticed, as I play Bridge or Scrabble against a computer, or Suduko for an hour at a time, that my emotional side feels cut off. As a way of self-numbing I would say that number and letter games could compete with class-A drugs when it comes to shutting down our feelings. It feels to me as though the dopamine kick I get from it has a more addictive edge to it, than a learning edge.</p>
<p>If you too are a games addict, notice the difference in how you feel when instead you read a book. It may feel like it takes more effort, especially when you first start to develop this new habit. A novel, or a book on philosophy, is going to use both sides of the brain: not only will you have feelings about what you read, but your mind will also get more of a work-out because you will make connections between what you are learning and what you already recognize.</p>
<p>When I talk about the benefits of learning, sometimes people confide in me that what stops them embarking on learning something is a sense of shame that they do not know it already. Susan Jeffers wisely said ‘Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway’. I say ‘Feel the shame and learn something anyway’. No one likes to feel vulnerable16 but unless we learn to tolerate some emotional vulnerability we will be endangering our growth, and if we do not grow we shrink – and if we do that we jeopardize our sanity.</p>
<p>Recently I was talking to a biologist about the benefits of maintaining the habit of learning. He asked me whether I was right- or left-handed. I said right. He told me that my chances of a full recovery after a stroke would be better if I was left-handed because left-handed people already have more neural connections than right-handed people. He added that if I started the habit of cleaning my teeth or working my computer mouse with my left hand I would begin to build ‘brain reserve’. If I later suffered a stroke it would put me in a better position to recover from it.</p>
<p>Whatever new activity we begin to do – from left-handed teeth-brushing, to learning a new language – we will make new neural connections, which can generate greater creativity and new ideas. A new idea has been likened to a shy woodland creature. To coax the shy woodland creature from the shadows into the clearing you must not scare it. Leave a little food for it and it will come out into the clearing where you can see it better. If you treat it well it will not go bounding back into the forest.17</p>
<p>Ideas rarely come from doing nothing. We stimulate our brains to come up with ideas when we learn new things or when we rehearse the things we are learning. I ran a five-day group for art students and art lecturers about the psychological processes of creativity. There was a general consensus that ideas came not from sitting around and waiting for inspiration to descend, but from working: trying things out, reading, learning and doing.</p>
