        <h3>5. The thinking friend</h3>
<p>There’s a routine that Niamh and Ian have. Every Wednesday, Niamh travels across the city to knock on Ian’s door around 7 p.m. Niamh does the supper; always simple, always more or less the same. The menu, however, isn’t the point. They meet like this because over the next few hours they will do something that – in both their experience – is painfully rare: think together.</p>
<p>What makes it even more strange is what they think about. They don’t wrestle with prestigious intellectual problems: how does the material brain generate the first-person experience of consciousness? Or, how can the theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity be reconciled? Rather they think together about seemingly minor issues.</p>
<p>A whole evening might be devoted to thinking through what’s nice about driving at night or why Joan Armatrading’s ‘Heaven’ is so moving. They might think about what makes for a genuinely good holiday or why Noga, a mutual acquaintance, is so hard to get on with. These might not be academically prestigious lines of enquiry (no university departments are devoted to studying them); they just happen to be highly relevant to the lives of Niamh and Ian.</p>
<p>Such matters sound pretty simple. But they are strangely hard to get to grips with. The answers seem easy – until one tries to spell them out to another person. Our brains, in fact, are far from perfect thinking machines; they are beset by various flaws, and the role of the thinking friend is to help us overcome these obstacles. For one thing, there’s a huge tendency to rely on words that express enthusiasm (or rejection). We say, ‘That was great’, ‘lovely’, ‘so nice’, ‘quite boring’, ‘so annoying’, etc., but we give no detail: what actually about that thing (or person) is lovely or awful? And why does it, or do they, have this particular effect on us, given that they don’t strike everyone as they strike us? The thinking friend pushes for clarification. Their desire to know more about our experience – to understand its granular character and the personal reasons behind it – is the stimulus we need to go into detail. And when we do, we discover ourselves. The thinking friend doesn’t combat our opinions and responses; they want to understand them deeply.</p>
<p>Then, the mind has an ingrained habit of wandering off topic: talking about one thing makes us think of something else, which jogs our memory about yet another thing. We may have started off talking about why a passage in a novel is so moving, and two minutes later we’re onto an anecdote about self-service checkouts at the supermarket. Without embarrassment, the thinking friend pulls us back into focus.</p>
<p>We’re not offended, we’re happy to return, but we needed their pleasant but precise reminder.</p>
<p>The thinking friend helps us overcome the natural, and debilitating, tendency of the mind to stay within certain self-imposed limits: we have a hypersensitivity around what we are or are not supposed to think, which blocks the path to what could be our more productive insights. Timidity disguises itself. An individual who seems intellectually very confident and bold may be constantly shying away from simpler, more straightforward ideas – even when these are really quite sensible and wise.</p>
<p>The joy of the thinking friend is that their (inevitable) mental timidity isn’t the same as ours. They can spot when our thinking is being driven by a determination to arrive at a predetermined and, to us, safe conclusion. It’s their company that makes us feel we could risk thinking differently.</p>
<p>And they keep us going when, left on our own, we’d simply give up. A basic principle is that the mind panics when a task seems to be taking longer than it should. A car trip that was supposed to take half an hour becomes a nightmare if we’re still on the road after four hours. But with a lot of things, we have no realistic sense of how long they ‘should’ take. Should it take five seconds – or five hours – to work out why you find a painting charming? The thinking friend encourages us to keep going (and we them). They project the sense that it is worth continuing to wrestle, expand, clarify, revise, summarise, revise again. In their company the task is allowed to be as demanding as it really is.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that it’s a friend we are thinking with: we need their curiosity about us, their desire to understand us, their enthusiasm for what we might discover and their esteem even while we are struggling to articulate our ideas. The cumulative result – after months and years of thinking together – is a deeper engagement with our own thoughts and feelings; a sharper, more evolved sense of what we really think and feel, want and need, care about and like.</p>
<p>A thinking friendship meets our need for another to care enough about our emerging ideas to help us know our own minds.</p>
