        <h2>Beyond Standard Relationships</h2>
<p>There’s a collective picture of what a good relationship is supposed to look like that’s become deeply embedded in our imaginations. Let’s call it the Standard Model and imagine some of what it requires of a proper couple:</p>
<p>•   to share a home and always sleep in the same bed</p>
<p>•   to only ever have sex with one another</p>
<p>•   to share all domestic tasks</p>
<p>•   to merge finances</p>
<p>•   to get very involved in each other’s families</p>
<p>•   to have children</p>
<p>•   to share the same group of friends</p>
<p>•   to spend nearly every evening and weekend together</p>
<p>•   to always take holidays together</p>
<p>Because this picture is so familiar today – and so prestigious – we don’t easily get round to asking if it’s always a very good arrangement and, in particular, whether it’s a particularly good arrangement for us, given who we are and all the many ways in which we are fastidious, unique and peculiar.</p>
