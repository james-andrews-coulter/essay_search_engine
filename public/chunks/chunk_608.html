        <h2>WHAT A BAD PARENT CAN DO TO A CHILD</h2>
<p>The power of a bad parent is almost without limit. Within only a few years, a bad parent might be able to create an offspring who:</p>
<p>is convinced that they are unworthy</p>
<p>hates themselves without limit</p>
<p>is perpetually certain that they have done something very wrong</p>
<p>constantly anticipates catastrophe</p>
<p>loathes their own appearance</p>
<p>fears everyone’s rage and envy</p>
<p>cannot enjoy sex</p>
<p>is unable to explore their mind</p>
<p>always feels they need to agree, comply, and people-please</p>
<p>can’t show their true self for fear of revolting everyone</p>
<p>will never put a stop to their own abuse, in whatever form this comes</p>
<p>has to puff themselves up with money and acclaim to feel acceptable</p>
<p>is compelled to torture others as they were tortured</p>
<p>cannot tolerate ambiguity and criticism</p>
<p>cannot play</p>
<p>must always be right</p>
<p>has to sabotage anything promising, kind, and good that enters their life</p>
<p>And that’s just to start the list.</p>
