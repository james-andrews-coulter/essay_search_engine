        <h4>8. Respect Difference</h4>
<p>Bernard Shaw once said, ‘Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you; they may have very different tastes.’</p>
<p>How much solitude does a person need? There is no real answer to this, because everyone is different. There is a helpful vocabulary for anyone trying to think this through, although recently it
  has got clogged up a bit – the language of Introversion and Extroversion.</p>
<p>Based on Carl Jung’s 1921 definition of personality ‘traits’, a whole system of analysis has developed around the question of how much solitude people want or need. The
  suggestion (and there are various ‘explanatory’ theories, ranging from cortical stimulation to childhood expectation and experience) is that there are two distinct types of people, who
  process stimulation differently. For example, in one set of defining qualities you have statements like:</p>
<p>Extroverts are ‘action’ oriented, while introverts are ‘thought’ oriented.</p>
<p>Extroverts seek ‘breadth’ of knowledge and influence, while introverts seek ‘depth’ of knowledge and influence.</p>
<p>Extroverts prefer more ‘frequent’ interaction, while introverts prefer more ‘substantial’ interaction.</p>
<p>Extroverts recharge their energy by spending time with people, while introverts recharge their energy by spending time alone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it has proven extremely difficult to create a satisfactory way of testing who is which in any very useful way. This is partly because most people do not have a
  single consistent style of responding, but are more introverted or extroverted in different contexts or moods, and partly because it has proved nearly impossible to find a testing method which is
  not heavily culturally biased. ‘Do you enjoy going to parties?’ is based on the Western assumption that there are parties of a particular type to go to, whereas in some countries
  gathering in groups may not perform the social function of ‘parties’ at all. (For example, going to church, a social gathering that is enjoyable to most of the participants, and often
  noisy with singing and dancing, may well be a ‘party’ for some individuals or cultures and not for others.)</p>
<p>So some psychologists have claimed that happiness is a matter of possessing three traits: self-esteem, optimism and extroversion, and that studies prove that extroverts are happier than
  introverts. However, these findings have been questioned, because the ‘happiness prompts’ given to the studies’ subjects, such as ‘I like to be with others’ and
  ‘I’m fun to be with’, only measure happiness among extroverts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if extroversion makes people happier, this might be because Western Europeans, and especially Americans, live in an ‘extroverted society’ that rewards extrovert
  behaviours and rejects introversion. Extroverted societies have been described as validating a ‘culture of personality’, whereas other cultures are ‘cultures of character’
  where people are valued for their ‘inner selves and their moral rectitude’. These cultures, such as in Central Europe or Japan, prize introversion. And it transpires that in such
  cultures introverts report greater happiness than extroverts! This is not as twisted as it looks: it makes people feel happy to be approved of.</p>
<p>There are two social tendencies which further complicate this: the first is the apparent irresistible desire to move these sorts of words from adjectives to nouns. So someone with strongly
  introverted inclinations becomes ‘an introvert’. This divides and separates people from each other and traps people in boxes. (‘She is a blonde’, ‘he is a
  homosexual’ and ‘they are disabled’ are other examples where a single characteristic comes to define the person; they may all be true, but they do not describe the fullness and
  complexity of most individuals.)</p>
<p>The other social tendency that goes with this is the universal difficulty we all have with difference itself: the principle of ‘different but equal’ is almost impossible for people
  to maintain without effort – once you have created this sort of binary system, almost everyone instinctively gives higher value to one or other of the ‘differences’, usually the
  one with which they most comfortably associate themselves. There is a nice example of an American church leader urging congregations to appoint pastors who scored high on extroversion tests because
  ‘of course Jesus was an extrovert’.</p>
<p>Sadly, then, although the idea that introversion and extroversion are both normal variants of behaviour ought to help us accept ourselves and understand others, it does not always have this
  effect.</p>
<p>Moreover we should not really need a complicated psychological test-kit to say something so simple. Individuals are different – and we value difference and individuality rather highly in
  our present society. We would very properly resent government policies designed to make us all exactly the same, insisting for example that we all wore identical uniforms or listened to the same
  music. It is reasonable and normal then that people should like different amounts of solitude. Even those people who never want any at all should respect those who do – and vice versa –
  and indeed, as fellow human beings, try to understand why and appreciate the different values that ought to enrich us as a society. It is interesting, but beyond my brief, to wonder why this is so
  hard: all of us want to be treated as complex and unique human beings, but simultaneously want everyone to be just like ourselves.</p>
<p>Used carefully and discriminatingly, avoiding the temptation to absolutize the sets of behaviours, and understanding the limits of the terms, I do find thinking about these psychological
  ‘tags’ can be useful. If nothing else, the words can be used to open up conversations about how much solitude, quiet and social withdrawal different individuals need: ‘Do you
  think of yourself as more extroverted or introverted?’ is quite simply a more interesting and less-rude question than ‘Why are you single?’ or ‘Why are you so
  antisocial?’</p>
<p>And asking people why they like being alone or what they get out of it (and of course listening to their answers) is one very effective way of learning about being alone and enjoying it.</p>
