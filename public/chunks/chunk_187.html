        <h1>3. The Big Relationships</h1>
<p>‘Hirsute Highland heifers graze in fields greener than guacamole.’</p>
<p>(ALAN TAYLOR)</p>
<p>There is a lot of stuff out there. Mostly green stuff, with a few other scattered colours and, at first, none of it seems to betray to the viewer a lot of thought in the
  way it has been scattered.</p>
<p>If you have a space in your house where you chuck things that have no other logical home – a big cupboard, an attic, an entire garage – then you will know the feeling I am referring
  to here. The one that comes from being confronted with a lot of stuff with no apparent beauty, system, method, purpose or allure. This feeling of mild dread sits close to the sensation of watching
  the contents of a full bin-bag empty onto the floor through a tear in the bottom. It is the feeling of being gently overwhelmed by chaos, and nobody likes to be overwhelmed. (Whelmed, yes;
  but overwhelmed, less so.)</p>
<p>When our initial enthusiasm for nature in theory collides with the real thing, it is hard not to feel daunted. A metaphorical skip into the delights of the outdoors becomes a slow crash of
  realization . . . ‘Is there no end to all this random matter?’ This is a normal reaction and not an unhealthy one. It does at least mean we have noticed some of the detail in our
  surroundings, but it also hints at the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>If we look at one example from the plant kingdom, and then one from the animal, we will see the scale of this challenge.</p>
<p>Orchids are one member of one branch of the flower family. There are 25,000 different species of orchid alone. No typo, 25k. If, each day, you took it upon yourself to study and
  understand one orchid, it would take 68.5 years before you had covered this one species. You could then move on to the daisies.</p>
<p>In 1995 a team of scientists travelled to Panama and studied a group of nineteen trees, looking for beetles. They found them. The scientists identified 1,200 species of beetles, and of these,
  960 were new to science.</p>
<p>There really is a lot of stuff out there.</p>
<p>How do we begin to convert a sense of being daunted into one of connection? The key is to start at the opposite end of the scale. We must forget individual species to begin with, and focus our
  interest more broadly. By building a simple collection of general insights, and leaving species out of the mix for now, the outdoors morphs from stuff to shape, and from seeming
  randomness to apparent patterns. Think of the progression in this way:</p>
<p>Initial confusion → Recognizing landscapes and habitats → Knowing what to expect in each habitat → Recognizing fine connections and any anomalies</p>
<p>In this chapter we are going to look at a total of fifteen building blocks. If these are new to you, that might seem like a lot. But give them a chance, as they can help
  explain almost everything you see in nature. Besides, the alternative is to start at page 1 of an orchid book that weighs half a ton.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some of the simplest of these building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All animals, humans included, need water. Water sources increase the local populations of animals, and the presence of animals often indicates the presence of water
      nearby. London would not exist without the Thames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plants can survive on basic chemical nutrients – air, sunlight and minerals – but all animals need to eat other living things. They need food in the form of
      plants or other animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animals that eat plants tend towards living in groups: there is usually no shortage of plant matter, and they benefit from having more eyes to look out for
      predators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predators tend to work alone if they are going for small prey or in packs if they are going after very large prey.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can deduce that if we see an animal, it follows that there must be some water and a specific food source in the form of a plant or another animal very nearby. If we add
  some more building blocks the picture starts to get a little more interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the wild, given enough time, trees will come to dominate all land, outside of extreme regions like the Arctic or high mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most plants, including young trees, cannot survive being bitten down to ground level. Grasses are one of the most significant exceptions: their bud – the part of
      the plant needed for new growth – is below the surface and survives grazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is tough for all wild plants and animals, and they are very sensitive to their environment. They have each evolved to out-compete other species if environmental
      conditions – i.e. habitat – are suitable, but struggle if they are not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The simple concepts above explain the appearance of the landscapes we see.</p>
<p>Exercise 12</p>
<p>In this exercise we are going to see building-block 5 in action.</p>
<p>Look at the photo of a mountain below. Notice the way you can spot different habitats as you look from the bottom to the top. Deciduous trees thrive in the warm sheltered valley, these give
      way to conifers a little higher up, then a little higher the conditions are too hard and all the trees give up at the ‘treeline’. Above this, the hardier shrubs like gorse and
      heather take over, and going higher still, only the hardiest grasses survive and these will continue up to the snowline, if a mountain is high enough. Each plant has thrived within its own
      microhabitat, and none of them could survive within each other’s for long.</p>
<p>Plant life changes dependably with altitude, giving us nature’s altimeter.</p>
<p>The beauty of this simple way of looking at habitats on a mountain is that it will work all over the world, with no knowledge of individual species. It is one of the best ways of forming a
      small instant connection with a landscape. In natural navigation terms, this is nature’s altimeter.</p>
<p>Before agriculture came onto the scene about six thousand years ago, woodland dominated the British Isles. To look after livestock and sow crops, it was necessary to clear the
  woodland. The result is what we see today, a tussle between humans, woodland, edible crops, grazing animals and grasses.</p>
<p>The next time you pass through a variety of inland rural landscapes in a car or train, notice how every single one of these landscapes can be explained by the principles above.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, you will see one or more of four things:</p>
