            <h3>¶ Advertising</h3>
<p>Adverts wouldn’t work as powerfully as they do if they didn’t operate with a very good sense of what our real needs are and what we really require in order to live good lives. Their emotional pull is based on their wise understanding that we are creatures who hunger not so much for material goods as for sexual love, good family relationships, connections with others and the feeling that we are respected. Advertisers build their most compelling campaigns by tapping into their intimate knowledge of our psyches.</p>
<p>An advert for a car might not tell us much about the quality of the suspension or the technology that went into the metallic paint because it realises that such things (mostly) don’t touch our souls. Instead it shows us what we really want: a family coping well with the ups and downs of life or a dignified grey-haired man who knows how to greet the challenges of existence with stoic strength. An advert for jewellery will mainly be about a couple who are still close after ten years of marriage; a chocolate bar or a cashmere jumper might be brought to our notice by means of a touching evocation of friendship.</p>
<p>This approach can look cynical, but there is a touch of tragedy in the situation – the tragedy that our manufacturers lag so far behind our advertisers. These manufacturers know how to make rather good car suspensions and can produce utterly reliable timepieces; the jumpers may be elegant and the chocolate delicious. However, none of these manufacturers make much headway in delivering the things we really would love to be getting: the good family life, the self-belief, the warm marriage and the better friendships that currently painfully elude us and whose exquisite portrayal cleverly tricked us (perhaps) into buying a sedan or a barbecue set.</p>
<p>In a stern mood, we might think that, in an ideal society, advertisers would be banned from hinting that the right bag or oven-ready meal could help us to find love and companionship. But the real solution goes in a different direction. We should want manufacturers and businesses to become much more ambitious about solving our real problems and to generate products that might actually help us with our big, underlying longings.</p>
<p>In most adverts, the pains and the hopes of our lives have been superbly identified, but the products on the shelves remain almost comically at odds with our real needs. The task is not to ban advertisements but to create an economy that lives up to their deepest promises.</p>
