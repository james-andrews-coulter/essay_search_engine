        <h2>THE DEFENSELESS IMPRESSIONABILITY OF A CHILD</h2>
<p>To accept the importance of childhood, we need above all to take on board and inwardly feel the desperate impressionability and vulnerability of a one-or two-year-old child. Notice, first, their scale. The fingers are implausibly tiny, the wrists even more so. A modest bump to the head or three centimeters of water can finish them off. Notice, too, how out of control they are. Saliva dribbles from their mouth, their head bobs drunkenly when they are weary, they fall asleep in supermarkets or on the laps of near strangers. They’re wholly, terrifyingly trusting. They lack all defenses. They take everything at face value. They’ll follow you wherever you want to take them. You can tell them strange stories about who lives in the house next door, or why the trees look the way they do, or what sort of a human being you are. And they’ll agree. They have no place from which to judge anything independently. They can’t tell if Mommy is as nice as she claims, they simply know that she has supernatural powers and understands how to drive a car and make lumps of dough morph into cakes in the oven. They won’t be able to determine whether what Daddy is doing is reasonable or kind until another decade has passed.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is both touching and—when you remember how damaged certain adults are—appalling. You can do anything with little people. Tell them you are their friend and then burn their hand, give them a lollipop and then separate them from their parents, whisper to them late at night that no one must ever know about this and ruin them for life. It sounds highly disturbing and it is.</p>
<p>We were those little people once. We aren’t any longer. We know the ways of the world. We’re tall and our voices carry. We can think freely. But this was once us—and the distortions of those years have a habit of remaining embedded within our minds for a long time, beneath a substratum of maturity. We owe it to ourselves to take a very patient look at what might have happened to us before we knew who we were.</p>
<p>WHAT IS A GOOD PARENT?</p>
<p>We can afford a few generalizations. First, and most importantly, a competent parent is someone who can feel inordinately pleased that their child has come into the world—and never ceases to remind themselves or their offspring of the fact, in direct and indirect ways, at small and large moments, pretty much every day. There is no risk of spoiling anyone by doing so: Spoilt people are those who were denied love, not those who had their fill of it.</p>
<p>Second, the good parent is attuned to their child; they listen—very closely indeed—to what the small person is trying to say. This means getting down on their knees and paying attention to messages that may sometimes sound extremely weird. Maybe the child is saying that they are very sad, even though it’s their birthday and the parent has gone to enormous trouble with the presents. Maybe they are saying that they are angry with their teacher, even if education is in principle very important and the school was difficult to get into. Maybe they are explaining that they are fed up with Granny, though of course she means well and she’s our mother too. Children are filled with complicated emotions that may have no place in the average adult’s assessment of what is “normal,” let alone convenient. Good parents suspend judgment and check their certainties. There is no danger of creating an entitled brat by doing so. People who cause a fuss don’t generally do so because they have been listened to a lot; they start screaming—and later taking drugs and robbing stores—because their smaller, younger messages were never heard.</p>
<p>A good parent is, furthermore, not so fragile that they constantly need to be obeyed. They can take being sometimes called a fool because they lost their pride long ago. They’re sufficiently on top of the unfairness of life not to mind being someone on whom a child, especially a teenage one, occasionally offloads their disappointments at the misery of everything. They don’t need to instil terror; they have the self-confidence to be ignored or overlooked brusquely when a child’s development requires it.</p>
<p>A good parent isn’t envious of their children. They are strong enough to allow them to have a better life than they did. They aren’t sadists: They never derive relief from making a child miserable. They don’t feel any cleverer themselves by telling the child that they’re an idiot, or more in control by monitoring the child’s every move.</p>
<p>They don’t want to pass on their sadness and regret. They don’t think it’s a good idea to make someone very unhappy because someone else made them miserable long ago.</p>
<p>They are sufficiently on top of their issues to be able to warn their children about them. They make it easy for the child to work out what the family madness is—and to move on from it. They don’t insist on their normality and then challenge the child to determine where they’ve been lied to.</p>
<p>They don’t inject their poison into anyone: Their jealousy, terror, ambition, or disappointment remains a matter for them alone.</p>
<p>They don’t need attention from their own children because they have enough of an audience elsewhere.</p>
<p>They don’t demand admiration—and certainly not gratitude. They know how to be calm and even boring. They absorb the child’s excitements and terrors without adding to them. They show up day after day and act with reliable dullness. Of course they have drama going on beneath the surface, it’s just that no child wants to think of their parent as overly complicated or three-dimensional. The good parent doesn’t mind being, in a benign sense, a caricature.</p>
<p>The good parent knows how to play because their imagination is free: the doll can be a princess, the couch can be a ship and dinner might be pushed back by half an hour without peril. They’re solid enough inside not to need to impose rigidity on the world. Sometimes, they can allow themselves to be very silly.</p>
<p>They know about boundaries. The game was hilarious for a long time, but now it’s the moment to wind down, to put the paints away, to get back to work or to go up to bed. The good parent doesn’t mind being hated for a time in the name of honoring reality.</p>
<p>Around the good parent, the child is, at the same time, allowed to utter “no” about certain matters, being a center of sufficient autonomy to disagree. It should not have the final say but should invariably have a voice.</p>
<p>The good parent is tender: Of course teddy’s lost eye doesn’t matter in the broad run of things, but the child’s world is small and minor things loom large in it. Good parents therefore have the patience to respond to the child’s minor crises and delights from a sure sense that maturity will emerge through precisely targeted indulgence.</p>
<p>We might think back to our past and give our carers a score to measure how things went. It isn’t unfair or mean sometimes—in the privacy of our own minds—to hold people to account.</p>
