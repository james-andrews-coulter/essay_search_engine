        <h2>Meteor Crater</h2>
<p>Day to day, the evidence for the idea is so slight, and the entire concept so peculiar and contrary to our sense of things, that it is no wonder that we push it to the back of our minds and have resisted giving it its due place in public consciousness. And yet the evidence is incontrovertible: much of who we are and of how life on the planet has taken hold is to be explained by the arrival of asteroids and comets.
In the Earth’s early days, 4.5 billion years ago, things were entirely dry, lifeless and inert until around 3.8 billion years ago the planet underwent what is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment. In this roughly 100-million year period, giant planets were knocked off their normal orbits and scattered objects into the path of the terrestrial planets. A hundred thousand or so asteroids and comets of all different sizes smashed into the atmosphereless Earth, and on board these extraterrestrial objects came the central ingredients for life: the water in the oceans, the calcium in our teeth, the potassium in our brains, the carbon in our hair, the glycine in our cells and the ribose in our DNA.
The evidence has since then been well concealed. We can see the pockmarked surface of the Moon or Mars well enough through our telescopes, but on Earth, the mantle of life has cleverly disguised the story of our origins. Most of the craters have been filled in by vegetation, water or erosion. There remain only a hundred or so pristine impact sites to be seen anywhere on the planet.
For a long time, the locals refused to accept that this was what the place could be. They took it to be a volcano; many just called it a mountain. But one local meteoriticist, Harvey Nininger, insisted on the extraterrestrial theory. He toured the area, picking up small fragments of the alleged meteorite; he wrote a book called A Comet Strikes the Earth and set up the American Meteorite Museum not far from the crater’s rim. Settled scientific opinion now agrees: the big hole in the ground exists because, 50,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, a nickel-iron meteorite 50 metres wide slammed into Arizona at 12.8 kilometres a second, releasing approximately as much energy as 10 megatonnes of TNT.
Fortunately, it’s one of the most photogenic of all craters and so we might choose to pin an image of it to the fridge door and turn to it whenever we feel any temptations towards self-righteousness or grandiosity. If we were founding a new religion dedicated to wisdom and maturity, the crater might have a good claim to be considered the new Jerusalem.</p>
