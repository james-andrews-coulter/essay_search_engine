        <h2>Outwitting Procrastination</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One way to break paralysis around an unpleasant task is to introduce an even more unpleasant task, by comparison to which the first task starts to seem more appealing. A good way to start work on a tedious report is, therefore, to raise the spectre of a long-delayed thank-you letter or phone call to a tedious but kindly relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work offline as much as possible; the internet is – plainly – the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an egg timer: work for fifteen minutes and not a moment more. If that doesn’t help, try five minutes. Humiliate yourself into finding a unit of time you can stick to. It might be only a minute and a half. It often is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use starkly accurate working titles for your efforts: ‘First Rubbish Version’; ‘Second Marginally Less Rubbish Version’; ‘Initial Pathetic Sketch’. Don’t expect it to be right for a long time. If ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break a task into 100 sections. Note what percentage is done. For a 1,500-word report, every sentence is pretty much 1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a shower, go for a drive. We often have our best ideas when theoretically we’re not supposed to be working at all. The mind is so scared of thinking, it tends to wait to let out its more valuable thoughts until we are on a break.</p>
