            <h1>2. Incomprehension; or, Adversity in Love</h1>
<p>We are obsessed with love. Everyone is searching for it or thinking about it. Or so it seems, to judge by the number of advertisements for internet dating websites on trains,
  buses and the London underground, and by the number of such sites themselves: there may be as many as 8,000 online dating services worldwide, and there are even specialist web-dating sites for
  Christians, for Oxbridge graduates, for Herpes sufferers, for those who especially love pet animals and for those who want to date using mobile devices (‘No-frills Mobile Dating that’s
  super safe and actually works on every mobile phone, smartphones and dumbphones alike’; ‘love is in your handsTM’). There are also sites for those
  with military interests or who like wearing uniforms, for hippies, for vegetarians, for those who consider themselves ugly (‘dating for the aesthetically average’), for fans of Star
  Trek and all things science-fiction, for chavs, for geeks, goths and greens . . . the list goes on. There is also the seemingly endless supply of contemporary films and novels that celebrate
  romantic love; our contemporary idea that the principal motive for marriage is, or should be, love and that any other reason for marrying – say, financial security – is rather ignoble;
  our endless interest in the tittle-tattle that surrounds the love life of celebrities and our suspicion that, even in their miseries, they are getting something out of love we are not and would
  like to have; and so on.</p>
<p>It is evident that we see something in romantic love – and it is romantic love I want to discuss in this chapter – that suggests to us the promise of something deeply important and
  almost irresistible. But we all know that that promise is often disappointed: divorce rates are rocketing, pre-nuptial agreements suggest that we know we are likely to be let down, and we are all
  familiar with the agonies of the loss of the one we love, or unrequited love, or just the sensation that the person we love is quite different from the person we thought he or she was. What is it
  that we are looking for in love? And how can we make better sense of love’s disappointments and the conflicts that it so often brings with it?</p>
<p>Falling in Love</p>
<p>Since at least the time of Socrates and Plato in the fifth and fourth century BC, romantic love has been identified as a form of madness or intoxication.
  The deity of romantic love was Eros, and it is therefore also often referred to as eros. In the nineteenth century, Stendhal repeated the same idea, speaking in his book Love of ‘the
  madness known as love, a madness which . . . provides man with the greatest pleasures that are given to beings of his species to taste on earth’ (De l’amour, 39). There is no
  doubt that this madness or intoxication is central to romantic love. For most of us in the modern bureaucratized world – the ‘administered world’ as Theodor Adorno put it –
  life occurs within massive organized structures that we do not fully understand and even less control – I mean, principally, the workplace. Moreover, as the sociologist Max Weber made clear,
  we in the modern West live in a world that is largely disenchanted: the ancient gods have left us, and the Christian God is dead for many of us, as Nietzsche famously said. Ours is a flattened
  world, in which mystery has been replaced by scientific explanation, and nature’s meaningfulness has been ousted by the blind forces of evolutionary biology. Hence our deep attraction to the
  intoxication of love.</p>
<p>For in this intoxication we suddenly have a sense of something so much deeper and more real than our ordinary world with its tiresome duties, commitments and responsibilities, and with its
  prosaic flatness. The sense of abandon, of letting go, that accompanies romantic love stands in such a sharp contrast to our quotidian activities, and provides such a sense of release from them,
  that it is no wonder that we are seemingly irresistibly drawn to eros. Indeed, eros is really Eros: he is the only god many of us have left, and divinizes a world in which it is otherwise difficult
  to find meaning. Of course, this experience of eros is not new to us, as my reference to Socrates and Plato makes clear, but it has a special meaning for us in modernity.</p>
<p>Eros, then, is a kind of escape. But it is also a kind of escape that enables us to feel at home in the world. That was what the old religions did; they gave us a sense that this world is our
  home, that we can find our meaning here, even if that meaning eventually led outside the world to the kingdom of God. The experience of romantic love, precisely because it makes not simply the
  beloved person but everything lovely to behold, is an experience that seems to give us a sense of homecoming, of finally being at peace with the world.</p>
<p>The Legacy of Christianity</p>
<p>Many of our thoughts about love come from Christianity. Crucial are the ideas that love is utterly unconditional, eternal and wholly unselfish, as Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians
  13: 5–7: ‘Charity [i.e., love] . . . seeketh not her own . . . beareth all things . . . never faileth’. Paul was talking about a kind of love other than the romantic variety, but
  we often fantasize that his sentiments apply to eros. We suppose that in romantic love we fully see the reality of the beloved and are wholly concerned about his or her welfare – in other
  words, we are generous, kind, tolerant and patient.</p>
<p>What this means is that we are able to combine the intense intoxication of romantic love with a belief what we are experiencing is wholly admirable, since it is perfectly selfless. It seems too
  good to be true: in romantic love we feel ourselves to be inebriated, our life to be irradiated with meaning, the world to be filled with loveliness and that we are wholly selfless.</p>
<p>Crystallization</p>
<p>It is too good to be true. And if you want to avoid some of the disappointments of love, you should be as coolly realistic about what eros is as it is possible to
  be.</p>
<p>In Love, Stendhal sought to understand, and at the same time overcome, his unrequited love for Mathilde Dembowski. He had met and fallen in love with her in 1818, but she never returned
  his love, and the more insistent he became the further she retreated from him. In his book, he formulated one of the most acute insights into the nature of romantic love. He called it the process
  of crystallization. If you love a woman, Stendhal writes,</p>
<p>you take pleasure in endowing her with a thousand perfections . . . In the end you overrate her as utterly magnificent, as something fallen from Heaven, whom you do not know
      but is sure to be yours.</p>
<p>If you leave a lover with his thoughts for twenty-four hours, this is what you will find:</p>
<p>At the salt mines of Salzburg, they throw a small leafless wintry branch into the depths of the abandoned excavation. Two or three months later they pull it out covered with a shining
      deposit of crystals. The smallest twigs, no bigger than the claw of a titmouse, are studded with an infinity of dazzling and shimmering diamonds. The original branch can no longer be
      recognized.</p>
<p>What I call crystallization is a process of the mind which draws from everything that occurs new proofs that the loved one is perfect. (De l’amour: 34–5)</p>
<p>Stendhal thinks, furthermore, that what he calls a second crystallization occurs, in which the process of attributing perfections to the beloved is deepened by any
  doubts the lover may have about whether he is loved in return. In order to allay his doubts, he searches for evidence that she loves him and, when he finds this evidence, ‘crystallization
  begins to reveal new charms’ in the beloved. And although the whole process of crystallization may have started with a sense of the beauty of the loved one, the ‘lover will soon come to
  find his mistress beautiful just as she is, without thinking about her real beauty.’ (De l’amour: 36; 52)</p>
<p>Obviously enough, Stendhal is articulating the importance of imagination in the whole process of love. Crystallization is only one example of this. Other examples include the role the
  imagination plays in making another person appeal to us not because of any intrinsic qualities he or she possesses, but rather on account of, say, the context in which we meet this person, or some
  other attribute, such as fame, for instance. It is well-known, for example, that perfectly average-looking people can seem wildly appealing, even beautiful, on account of the material goods they
  own or their profession. In such cases, the imagination is excited by the trappings surrounding a person, rather than anything about what he or she is really like, and, so to speak, the imagination
  mistakes the person, investing him or her with the glow of these trappings. Indeed it is extremely likely that there would be no such thing as romantic love without a large contribution from the
  imagination, which invests in the beloved a tangled mass of hopes, longings, desires, needs and fears which may have little to do with the person in question. And the difficulty is not so much that
  the imagination plays a role in romantic love as that it can blind one to what is going on. Stendhal comments:</p>
<p>From the moment he is in love, the wisest man no longer sees anything as it really is. He underrates his own qualities, and overrates the least favours granted by
      his beloved. Hopes and fears at once become romantic and wayward. (De l’amour: 55)</p>
<p>Often we are attracted to others, not so much on account of what they are, but because the things they own or have make them seem extraordinarily appealing.</p>
<p>The word ‘wayward’ is in English in Stendhal’s original French text, which heightens the strangeness of his description of what is happening to the lover. In
  any case, there is a lesson in all this for those disappointed in love, or for those who have to suffer unrequited love. Stendhal is offering a kind of therapy applied to romantic love. The aim is
  not to stop us ever feeling it – it would be absurd to embark on such a project anyway – but to enable us to cope better with its disappointments. He says: if your love for another is
  unrequited or is full of pain, then remember that, especially in its early stages, it is a kind of madness, something that at least partially blinds you both to the nature of your beloved and to
  your own condition. If you can do this, you might, with luck, be able to gain a certain kind of distance from it.</p>
<p>Another way of coping with disappointment in love is to make the pain part of your deeper understanding of life. I have a friend who went through a period in which he had more than his fair
  share of unsuccessful love affairs. He often felt wretched and miserable. But gradually I understood that there was something willed by him in his various liaisons, because he knew that by
  embarking upon them he was feeding his curiosity about the human scene. There was a way in which he wanted to affirm all things, good and bad, and these relationships were one route to that.
  Jean-Paul Sartre was like this too. He wrote in his war diaries:</p>
<p>It seems to me that, at this moment, I am grasping myself in my most essential structure: in this kind of desolate greed to see myself feel and suffer . . . in order to know
      all ‘natures’ – suffering, pleasure, being-in-the-world. It is precisely me, this continuous, introspective reduplication; this avid haste to put myself to good use;
      this scrutiny. I know it – and often I’m weary of it. That’s the source of the magical attraction dark, drowning women have for me. (The War Diaries: November
      1939–March 1940: 62)</p>
<p>There is something deeply admirable about such a stance. For sure, you have to be pretty stoical to see things this way, and you will run the risk of destruction if you live
  like this, but if you can see unrequited love or disappointment in love as a window onto the varieties of human experience, and to that extent as something to be welcomed, you will certainly learn
  something valuable about yourself and about life, and that itself will help make sense of the pain.</p>
<p>Getting Real</p>
<p>Stendhal is not, in any case, a cynic, despite his talk of madness. He is not denying that romantic love is valuable or claiming that such love does not really exist. As we have
  seen, he thinks that it is our greatest pleasure. But he is being realistic, and he does think that we can help ourselves by ridding ourselves of some of the illusions we have about love,
  amongst them those we have recovered from Christianity.</p>
<p>Choices, Choices</p>
<p>One of the central illusions from which we suffer in love is to suppose that we choose our beloved. We often contrast this with family relationships: you cannot choose your family, we think, but
  you can choose your friends and those you love. It is partly because we think this that we can often suffer from very unproductive guilt when things go wrong in a romantic relationship. ‘If I
  have chosen to be with this person,’ so the thought goes, ‘I really ought to be able to make it work, and if I cannot, if we cannot, then it is right to feel guilt and shame.’ In
  one way or another, implicitly or explicitly, such thoughts often haunt those who have to live with the consequences of a failed romantic relationship.</p>
<p>But I think that it is largely an illusion that we choose those whom we love. Apart from the fact that it is more or less completely a matter of chance whom one meets anyway, the truth is that
  the reasons we are attracted to someone else in the first place are deeply mysterious. We are much less in control here than we like to suppose. A person of kindness and virtue, in whom we find
  nothing to which to object, can leave us indifferent or cold from a romantic point of view, whereas someone else who is without these virtues may, for reasons that are almost completely unclear,
  appeal to us profoundly. Perhaps, as Stendhal says, it is his hat that is the problem:</p>
<p>A generous man showers a girl who is unhappy with the most delicate kindnesses; he has every virtue and it seems that love will be born. But he wears a shabby hat, and she
      notices that he mounts his horse in an inelegant manner. She tells herself with a sigh that she can never respond to the attention he gives her. (De l’amour: 51)</p>
<p>The mystery is how a mere hat can make all the difference. But it can, perhaps because in some enigmatic way it symbolizes something for the potential lover that she finds
  unpleasant. Or, of course, someone’s hat might work in the opposite way and attract us on account of the symbolic charge it carries for us. But the effect a person’s hat has on us, in
  one way or another, is not something we choose.</p>
<p>It is very important to remember that what makes us fall in love with someone might be some minor aspect of his or her manner, or way of moving, or style of speech. It is important, because
  believing that we have control over our love, over our loves, can lead to those forms of self-reproach that I mentioned earlier. This is not to say that one should not work at love: beyond the
  first period of intoxication, and when a measure of sobriety returns, one will certainly need to do that. But it is to say that love is not, contrary to received wisdom, unconditional. If
  you are in a relationship with someone and things begin to go wrong, then, unless you have had enough of the whole thing, you will want to find solutions to the problems. But it is important that
  you do not make things worse by insisting that true love is unconditional and berating yourself for your incapacity to love in such a way. It is better to be honest and seek to find and nurture
  those contingencies which sparked the love in the first place. Of course you will need to talk things through with your lover, but you might also be able to help your relationship even more by
  buying your partner a quirky hat – or going to see a madcap film together, or inviting friends out for a meal with you both: this would be part of what Nietzsche calls being
  ‘superficial out of profundity’.</p>
<p>What we need so often is to see the other as we first saw him or her, and this is one reason why Alain, in his short essay on the life of the couple in his Thoughts on Happiness,
  proposes that one solution to such problems in life might well be to spend time, as a couple, with others. Being with others means that we must be polite, he suggests, and this itself works
  positively to dissipate negative emotions. Moreover, the company of others occupies the mind and distracts from a destructive self-indulgence. ‘This is why’, he adds, ‘one must
  always be fearful for a couple that is too isolated and depends only on love’ (Propos sur le bonheur: 92–3). Clearly, what Alain has in mind is that, in company, you see your
  partner more as you did when you first got to know him or her, and this can remind you of what you liked so much about that person in the first place. If love is conditional, then nurture the
  conditions; do not seek to cultivate a love that can dispense with them.</p>
<p>Foolishness</p>
<p>‘When we are born, we cry that we are come / To this great stage of fools’ says King Lear. But we all naturally think that the others are the fools and we are not.
  This is why a trap that it is easy to fall into, even when your relationship is basically good, is complacency.</p>
<p>One magnificent exploration of such complacency is Ingmar Bergman’s film Scenes from a Marriage. Johan and Marianne have what seems to be a perfect marriage: two beautiful
  children, successful careers, money – the lot. But the seeds of destruction are clear from the first scene, in which Johan boasts of his intelligence and sensitivity, and a later scene in
  which they clearly take themselves to be hard-nosed realists when it comes to themselves, their life, and their marriage. They obviously think themselves above their friends Peter and Eva, who
  quarrel violently over dinner when they visit. But it is this very complacency that destroys them. They gradually realize that they are no better than anyone else; they are just as weak, vulnerable
  and unsure about their lives as others. They are, in a word, just as foolish – Bergman calls then ‘emotionally illiterate’. It is good fortune rather than any great talent or
  intelligence on their part that has kept them together. This is not to say that you do not need to work to make a relationship thrive or that talent and intelligence cannot help in this regard. But
  it is to say that a more helpful attitude is one of gratitude: to be grateful is to acknowledge the large residue of mystery in whatever it is that makes love endure. And Johan and
  Marianne do not see this. They think they have what they have by right. To think that is to run the risk of the kind of complacency that destroys them.</p>
<p>So one of the things necessary to keep love thriving is a healthy sense of one’s own foolishness, as I mentioned in the previous chapter. This is not a matter of self-criticism or the
  desire to reduce oneself in one’s own eyes. It is rather a matter of cultivating the capacity to laugh at oneself. It is a willingness to acknowledge that one knows much less than one thinks
  one does about what is good for one’s beloved. It is a matter of acknowledging how little one understands anyone else – especially, perhaps, the person one loves – and resisting
  the impulse to criticize what that person thinks or feels. ‘All of us are inconsiderate and imprudent, all unreliable, dissatisfied, ambitious . . . corrupt,’ as the Roman philosopher
  Seneca reminds us pithily. ‘Therefore, whatever fault he censures in another man, every man will find it residing in his own heart’ (‘On Anger’: 40).</p>
<p>Friendship</p>
<p>It is, in short, a matter of being a good friend.</p>
<p>Aristotle distinguished three bases for friendship: utility, pleasure and shared virtue or goodness. Some friendships, he said, are a matter of the friends being useful to each other, as in the
  friendship between colleagues, or between the client and the provider of a service – say, between you and the architect you employ to renovate your house. The second type of friendship is
  based on shared pleasure, as in those, for example, who enjoy sports together. The final type of friendship is, says Aristotle, the best: it is the ‘complete friendship . . . of good people
  similar in virtue’ (Nicomachean Ethics: 1156b, 6). And it is the best, he says, because, unlike the other two forms of friendship, which dissolve if the utility or pleasure no longer
  exists, it is enduring. Moreover, its great value is evident in that each friend cares about the other for the other’s sake, and not simply on account of what he or she can provide by way of
  utility or pleasure. This third type of friendship is also itself useful and contains pleasure, so it is a kind of synthesis of all that is good in the other two forms.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see what Aristotle is getting at, but it seems to me that he presents an overly moralized view of friendship. This is because he imagines that true friendship involves the
  friends in what one might call a shared project for the good, and central to their concern for each other is concern for their respective virtue, for the cultivation of virtue in each other. We can
  see this in Aristotle’s famous claim that ‘the friend is another himself’ (Nicomachean Ethics: 1166a, 31–32) and in his idea that ‘each [friend] moulds the
  other in what they approve of’ (Nicomachean Ethics: 1172a, 13–14). And that seems to me not only false to the nature of some genuine friendships but also unduly normative, that
  is, it tells us not what friendship is but what it ought to be.</p>
<p>An example to make my point is to be found in the film Werner Herzog made about his friendship with Klaus Kinski, which he ironically entitled Mein liebster Feind – My Best
  Fiend, as it came out in English, but more literally and correctly: ‘My Dearest Enemy’ (there is a play in the German on Feind, ‘enemy’ and Freund,
  ‘friend’). Despite all the – sometimes massive – conflict and hostility between the two men, they were clearly very close friends. Of course, you can always insist that
  unless a friendship is of the kind Aristotle values it is not a real friendship. But that is surely a case of fitting reality to the theory rather than allowing reflection to be properly responsive
  to the nature of reality. In truth, we love our friends in part for their faults, as Herzog loved Kinski, and, if we did not, we would have no friends, for we all have faults. Moreover, whilst
  friends may share certain traits with one another, friendship involves a capacity to be continuously aware of and accept the other as different from us. The philosopher Richard Wollheim is, I
  think, closer to the truth than Aristotle when he says that</p>
<p>[t]he essence of friendship lies, I suggest, in the exercise of a capacity to perceive, a willingness to respect, and a desire to understand, the differences between
      persons. Friendship lies in a response to the singularity of persons, and a person’s friendship extends only as far as such singularity engages him. (The Thread of Life:
      275–6)</p>
<p>If you want to be a good friend to the one you love, and if you want to solve the kinds of problems that inevitably arise between lovers, then, in all likelihood, part of what
  you need to do is to take Wollheim’s view of friendship to heart.</p>
<p>It is hard to do this, because one of the hardest things to do in life is to leave others alone. We have a natural tendency to think we know what is best for others and to want to tell
  them what to do. Reminding oneself of one’s foolishness is a way to counteract this. Moreover, I have come to believe that pretty much all criticism is at best pointless, at worst
  counterproductive, even when it is justified, certainly in the context of personal relationships. Even in those rare instances where criticism might be productive, it is a matter of extraordinarily
  delicate judgement, and most of us, most of the time, are likely to get it wrong. We should learn to be more cautious and circumspect when it comes to giving advice to those we love than we
  normally are.</p>
<p>Egoism</p>
<p>I mentioned above that one of the views about love that we have inherited from Christianity is that it is wholly selfless. We believe this in part because we tend to think of
  the vices as being wholly opposed to the virtues. But this is a myth. The virtues are nourished by the vices. As La Rochefoucauld puts it in his Maxims: ‘The vices enter into the
  composition of the virtues as poison enters into the composition of medicines. Prudence assembles and tempers them, and uses them against the ills of life’ (Maximes, no.182). Vanity
  and self-love enter into all kinds of virtues, helping to make them what they are. Of course, as La Rochefoucauld insists, they have to be tempered, but this is not the same thing as extirpating
  them. And romantic love certainly has its own share of egoism. The reason for this is that such love expresses a need of the other. In an acute discussion of Shakespeare’s Antony
  and Cleopatra, Allan Bloom brings this out magnificently. Speaking of the love the eponymous couple share, he writes:</p>
<p>This is not the confident and giving love so much admired in modernity. It is utterly selfish, and perhaps reveals more accurately the true nature of love as desperate need
      of each other. To my mind, Cleopatra’s complaint to the dying Antony, ‘Hast thou no care of me?’ (IV.xv.60), is a more powerful statement of love than are selfless expressions
      of sorrow or regret. Each is directed to the other by ineluctable need. Their admiration for each other means that they must possess each other no matter what the consequences. It is a hunger
      and a possessiveness more powerful than any other. Few men or women are capable of such selfish self-forgetting. (Love and Friendship: 305)</p>
<p>Antony and Cleopatra may be extreme, but they only bring out something that is implicit in all romantic love, namely, its egoistic self-concern. The point is not, of course,
  that one should seek to be selfish in love, or that we can never see selfishness as destructive of eros. It is rather a question of being honest about its nature. As with the idea that love is
  unconditional, the thought that love is wholly selfless can lead to self-reproach and frustration, especially if you are confronting problems in a relationship. All relationships involve an
  ever-shifting balance of power, and those who hope to find stability by seeking to allow themselves to be absorbed selflessly into their lover’s needs usually find in the end that they have
  been complicit in something destructive. What is required is a balancing act between difference forces, not a doomed attempt to rid the relationship, or one side of it, of all force.</p>
<p>A Fable</p>
<p>The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer recounts a fable in which he compares human beings to porcupines. On a cold day, the porcupines huddled together for warmth, but, in
  doing so, hurt each other with their spines. So they moved apart, but in this way became cold again. Human beings, says Schopenhauer, are like this: we crave the warm intimacy of closeness with
  others, especially in romantic love, but, once we get it, we can end up hurting each other through that very closeness. That can engender many conflicting emotions, perhaps the most common of
  which, and the most likely therefore to damage a relationship, are anger and jealousy.</p>
<p>Human beings’ quills are more difficult to see, but can inflict much pain.</p>
<p>Anger</p>
<p>The ancient philosophers were especially interested in anger and how to avoid it or control it. They have some very helpful things to say. For example, in an essay on anger,
  which repeats some of the advice offered earlier by Seneca, Plutarch gives a large role to Fundanus, who was consul in 107 AD and, apparently, notoriously quick-tempered. Fundanus tells us how he
  managed to tame his anger, and recommends a number of things to us to this end. For example, he reflects on the fact that the physical aspect of the angry person is deeply undignified: distorted
  features, flushing face, change of voice and so on. Realizing all this, he says, he became reluctant to appear so ‘unhinged’ to others, and says he wishes he could have an attendant who
  would hold a mirror up to him whenever he is angry, in order to remind him to avoid such indignity. Then he tells us to reflect on others who resisted anger, even when anger might have been
  justified.</p>
<p>My favourite example is that of Antigonus, who overheard some of his soldiers cursing him close to his tent, unaware that he could hear them. He looked out at them and said: ‘Oh dear,
  can’t you go further away to criticize me?’ Fundanus also tells us that if we are angry we should wait to act, because, once we cool down, a more moderate response may seem more
  sensible. Then he suggests that anger is nearly always the result of our feeling slighted or ignored, so we should seek to develop a sense of indifference to such feelings – like Diogenes
  who, when he was told that some people were laughing at him, replied: ‘But I don’t feel laughed at.’ And again Fundanus recommends that we learn to be pleased with small things,
  to develop a simple lifestyle – not to be fussy about what we eat and drink, for example. We should learn, he says, ‘not to need a lot of extras’ (‘On the Avoidance of
  Anger’: 194). And Fundanus emphasizes that these strategies can help when it comes to intimate relationships.</p>
<p>To all this we may add Seneca’s advice about seeking to know one’s own limits so that one does not take on tasks that are overly demanding; failure will otherwise be likely and anger
  the probable consequence. In the situation of romantic love, the point is helpful: do not expect yourself to give more than you can. This is not a plea for laziness, of course, but for a realistic
  sense of who we are. I once asked a friend, who has been in a healthy relationship for the best part of thirty years, what the secret was. He answered: ‘Low expectations’. That could be
  interpreted as miserably cynical, but it was not. He was being realistic – not only about what the relationship could give him, but also about what he could give to the relationship. Doing
  moral press-ups is much more difficult than physical ones, and usually leads to disaster. As the French essayist Montaigne put it, if you seek to fly like an angel you will crash all the more
  violently to earth.</p>
<p>Seneca also advises us to nurture the mind with ‘pleasurable arts’: ‘pleasant pursuits prove a balm to the troubled mind’ (‘On Anger’: 26). Applied to the
  context of love, this is in accord with my earlier thought about nurturing contingencies: love is nourished through the couple’s sharing pleasure together. Pleasant pursuits prove a balm to
  troubled love. The point is obvious. We all know it. But it is worth reiterating, because we forget it so easily.</p>
<p>None of this is to deny that anger can ever be justified – though that is what Plutarch thought – but it is an appeal to us to learn to educate our anger.</p>
<p>The anecdote about Antigonus is especially revealing. For what he has clearly grasped is that it is no use expecting not to be criticized. He accepts the fact that one will inevitably
  be criticized, and that the best thing is not to rail against that. His outlook is very close to something expressed by Nietzsche in Human, all too Human in the context of friendship.</p>
<p>Just think about how different feelings are, how divided the opinions, about even the closest acquaintance; how even the same opinions in the heads of our friends have a
      quite different place or intensity than in yours; how hundreds of times there are grounds for misunderstandings, for flight filled with enmity. After all that, you will say to yourself:
      ‘How unsure is the ground on which all our bonds and friendships rest, how close are cold downpours and bad weather, how lonely is each person!’ Whoever grasps this . . . will
      perhaps . . . cry: ‘Friends, there are no friends!’ But rather he will admit to himself: ‘Indeed, there are friends, but error or illusions about you have brought them to you;
      and they must have learnt to be silent in order to remain your friend. For such human relationships rest almost always on the fact that a few things are never said, indeed, that they are never
      touched upon . . . Are there people who would not be mortally wounded if they found out what their most intimate friends in the final analysis think of them?’ (Menschliches,
      Allzumenschliches: ein Buch für freie Geister: I, 376)</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s point is that friendship depends in part on the kind of tact that involves a willingness not to know all the other thinks of one, a willingness to
  accept that one cannot know these things. In other words, friendships flourish, amongst other things, under conditions of mutual incomprehension: your friend will
  inevitably remain, in many ways, a mystery to you, and that is one of the things that nourishes the friendship. And the same goes for romantic love, as Dorothy Rowe pointed out (Depression: the
  Way out of Your Prison: 133–4). If you want your love to flourish, accept that you cannot fully know your beloved, that your beloved cannot fully know you, and that, per
  impossibile, were you to know each other fully, that would kill the love.</p>
<p>Jealousy</p>
<p>Bearing this in mind can also help when dealing with jealousy, one of the emotions most destructive of love. Many people are subject to jealousy in romantic relationships, and
  there can, of course, be times when it is justified. However, it is well known that jealousy, once it is triggered, can take a hold in a way which is self-perpetuating, feeding on suspicion in such
  a way that there is nothing the person who is the object of that jealousy can do to assuage it. The reason for this is that jealousy wants something it cannot have: it desires a kind of perfect
  surveillance of another, and, even if it could achieve this with respect to another’s behaviour, it cannot do so in the case of another’s thoughts and feelings. There are two principal
  reasons for this: firstly, even if the jealous person knows in a general way what the other thinks and feels, there is always room for interpreting this knowledge in order to make it seem as if it
  justified the jealousy in question; secondly, it just is not possible to know precisely and completely what another thinks and feels.</p>
<p>One of the things one should bear in mind if one is prone to jealousy is that nothing can satisfy it. Further, what the jealous person wants is, ultimately, that the other person not have a life
  of his or her own, as Tolstoy brings out so magnificently in exploring Anna’s jealousy of Vronsky, and Proust brings out in Marcel’s attitude towards Albertine. It is the thought that
  Vronsky and Albertine have aspects of their lives which do not involve Anna and Marcel respectively that is unbearable to them. Yet, the painful irony is, as Proust brings out, that it is precisely
  the sense that the other person can introduce us to a whole other world that is one of the things that makes us fall in love with him or her in the first place. That the beloved lives in a world
  that is not one’s own and to which one can be introduced is immensely exciting, but jealousy feeds off the same sense of the otherness of the beloved. This is one of the reasons why love and
  jealousy so often go hand in hand: they are nurtured, in part, from the same source. If you suffer from jealousy, you should try to remind yourself not only that what you want is futile, because it
  cannot be achieved, but also that whatever is tormenting you is, in all likelihood, the very same thing that made you love the other person in the first place. As ever in life, one has to pay, and
  the idea that any condition of life could give us all we want is a mere chimera.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it is, of course, true that jealousy in the context of romantic love is most likely to be occasioned by sexual infidelity or fear of such. Both the experience of falling in love and
  the profounder love that issues from this as the relationship deepens tell us that the normal state of affairs is fidelity and that infidelity is bad. But what this way of looking at things
  overlooks is that fidelity is not something simply to be expected, but a real and deep achievement. This was expressed comically but wisely by Dustin Hoffman when he was
  interviewed for Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4. A friend had given him the following advice, he explained: ‘the only way a marriage can be successful is that the husband is
  scared shitless of his wife’. Hoffman recognized that there was something profound in that because, in his view, we are – Hoffman had men in mind in particular, obviously enough –
  not well suited by nature to remain in a relationship with one person for the length of time that, these days, we often suppose the norm – as it might be, a lifetime. Commitment, he
  said, is difficult, requiring a great deal of diligence and discipline. Fear of one’s wife, he suggested, helps keep one from straying.</p>
<p>Hoffman’s realistic and humorous wisdom is echoed by the General’s melancholy wisdom in his reflections on fidelity in Sándor Márai’s novel Embers.
  Looking back on the liaison that his best friend, Konrad, had had with his, the General’s, wife over forty years before, he says:</p>
<p>What is fidelity, what do we expect of the woman we love? I am old, and I have thought a great deal about this too. Is the idea of fidelity not an appalling egoism and also
      as vain as most other human concerns? When we demand fidelity, are we wishing for the other person’s happiness? And if that person cannot be happy in the subtle prison of fidelity, do we
      really prove our love by demanding fidelity nonetheless? . . . Now, in my old age, I would not dare answer these questions as unequivocally as I would have done forty-one years ago . . .
      (Embers: 220)</p>
<p>That we find it hard to accept what is being said here is a sign of its truth.</p>
<p>In Mozart’s opera Così fan tutte, two officers, Ferrando and Guglielmo are engaged to two sisters, Dorabella and Fiordiligi respectively. Don Alfonso (a vecchio
  filosofo: an old philosopher) claims that, contrary to the soldiers’ claims that their fiancées will be eternally faithful, he can prove that, like all women, they are fickle. A
  bet is made. Ferrando and Guglielmo leave, ostensibly to go to war, then reappear disguised as ‘Albanians’. In this guise, they manage to seduce the two women. The truth is revealed to
  all, and Don Alfonso urges the two officers to forgive their fiancées – after all, ‘così fan tutte’: ‘all women are like that’ (literally,
  ‘thus do all [women]’).</p>
<p>Some have seen the opera as misogynistic or cynical. But Mozart’s extraordinary music, in my view, allows the opera to transcend these categories and shows us an affirmative attitude
  towards human weakness and vulnerability, an urbane acceptance of the vicissitudes of all things human. And we should, after all, grant that fidelity is difficult, meaning that we could never
  understand the very concept of fidelity unless we understood it as something not easily or readily embodied in human life. Human beings are fickle by nature, as Machiavelli said. Hence it is that
  fidelity is an extraordinary achievement, and the jealous lover might do well to reflect on his or her jealousy in the light of the difficulty of fidelity. If we start from that thought, jealousy
  might become more tractable, precisely because a space has been opened up to see the cause of it – infidelity – not simply as dreadful without residue, but, as in Embers and
  Così fan tutte, as just one more expression of the terrible weakness of human beings as they make their hesitant, halting way through life.</p>
<p>Of course, I recognize that such an attitude is immensely difficult, especially when one is caught up in the throes of jealousy. For this reason, it is wise to reflect on such things when calm,
  in advance of experiencing jealousy, in case one does experience it. In other words, it is sensible to prepare oneself. It is worth remembering that peace of mind does not come easily or
  quickly and is a rare and difficult achievement. And if we ever achieve wisdom in these matters, our hold on it remains far from wholly secure. Samuel Johnson was right, in his cautionary tale
  Rasselas, to worry about fine-sounding words and have his character Imlac say: ‘Be not too hasty . . . to trust, or to admire the teachers of morality: they discourse like angels,
  but they live like men’ (The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia: 80). But that, too, expresses a kind of melancholy wisdom, and Johnson would have been the last to take it as a
  recommendation that one not seek to educate one’s emotional responses to the adversities of life. Indeed, his whole life stands as a moving testament to just that struggle.</p>
<p>The Limits of Love</p>
<p>In Corinthians, Paul presents love as universal in its power: it never fails, he insists. But he is wrong. It does. You can love someone you do not like; you can stop loving
  someone you do like; you and your partner can still love each other but be unable to be together. Love is just one aspect of a relationship, and by itself it is not enough to make a
  success of things. But part of the problem lies in what one counts as success and failure. We see the end of a relationship as a failure, but this is not necessarily the best way to think of
  things. Of course, no one can deny that when things come to an end, however they do, it is usually extremely painful for one of the partners or both. But I am not convinced that things are as
  clear-cut as we often suppose them to be.</p>
<p>A friend of mine told me that, though he was divorced, he did not really have the sense that he had ‘married the wrong woman’, as the clichéd phrase has it. In part, this was
  because he had had children with this woman, and nothing was more important to him than they were. Beyond that, he was puzzled by the idea that he could think of his ex-wife as ‘the wrong
  woman’, because it seemed to presuppose that there might have been, or might be, the ‘right woman’ somewhere: a woman with whom he would experience no difficulties whatsoever.
  But, he said to me, this is not so: his current relationship might be better than his marriage was, but this does not show that he ‘had got it wrong’ before, except in the obvious sense
  that the marriage ended. With his ex-wife he had had good and bad times, highs and lows – but all of that, he said, was his life. And though he might regret certain aspects of his
  life, he could not regret the whole thing.</p>
<p>My friend’s sense of the end of his marriage expressed, I think, a kind of fierce attachment to his own life as something uniquely valuable, not despite, but because of all its errors.
  There is wisdom in such a view and, if you are going through the loss of a loved one, you might find that reflecting on it helps a little: if not now, then at some later point, with luck and hard
  work, you might be able to see things in this way. Your life is, like my friend’s, uniquely valuable, not despite its disappointments but because of them, including those suffered in
  love.</p>
