        <h2>5. Age and Gender</h2>
<p>Time to drop in again on Gina’s parents, Sara and Clive. Sara isn’t quite as sanguine about getting older as she was when we last saw her. She’s gained some weight, which she thinks is ageing, and has started to worry that wearing her skirts short makes her look like ‘mutton dressed as lamb’. But then she wonders if sheep are an entirely female species, since Clive and his mates happily wear the same T-shirts and chinos as their 20-something sons and never fret about their resemblance to meat. Sara is contemplating having a facelift – only because, she says, she thinks she looks permanently ‘tired’, and wants how she feels inside (‘I don’t feel old’) to match her outside (‘but I’m beginning to look it’).</p>
<p>His and hers</p>
<p>Is Sara suffering from what Susan Sontag, in a major essay published in 1972, called ‘the double standard about ageing’? Sontag argued that a woman’s birth date was her dirty secret. Getting older, she claimed, was ‘less profoundly wounding’ for a man than it was for a woman because, for women, beauty was always identified with youthfulness. Older women, therefore, wanted to continue to look like girls, since those who could ‘pass’ as younger were still admired. But the bodies of old women who couldn’t were regarded as obscene.</p>
<p>The result of all this, Sontag suggested, was that women became ‘sexually ineligible’ much earlier than men: if a man were widowed in his forties or fifties he almost invariably went on to remarry someone younger, but this was rarely possible for women. And women, she lamented, acquiesced in it all, ending up full of self-hatred.</p>
<p>Sontag was clearly addressing her own anxieties – those of a classically beautiful woman approaching 40 (her essay was published four months before her birthday). She was prey to almost pathological anxieties about ageing, many of them social in origin, but others personal to her. She also seemed not to notice her own ageism.</p>
<p>Yet she made important observations about the gendered nature of ageing. How true are they forty years later? And do they give us any help in the business of ageing? In answer to the first question, over the intervening four decades the experience of ageing for women and men has become worse, better and different – all at the same time.</p>
<p>Worse because, in an era that’s so obsessed with the body and so permeated with visual images, appearance has assumed unprecedented importance. We’re now expected to scrutinize, discipline and beautify our bodies throughout the life course – you’re never too old to improve yourself, and never too young to start.</p>
<p>Although this often dresses itself up as a question of health, pull off its outer layers and underneath you find a preoccupation with youthfulness. What would an old, disabled but healthy and beautiful body look like? It’s a question we can’t answer today because those qualities seem mutually incompatible – that’s why the ‘but’ is there.</p>
<p>Of course stereotyping and prescriptive ideas about gender limit us at every age. A large survey of women conducted by a fashion company in 2011 came up with something it called ‘Midlife Mirror Angst’: women who were so uncomfortable with their reflection that they avoided it. Just 9 per cent of those over 50 felt happy with what they saw in the mirror, compared with 43 per cent of 20-somethings. It’s hard to decide which of those two percentages is the more depressing. Whichever, it suggests that the majority of women are unhappy about the way they look.</p>
<p>Oh the hands, the hands! They’re regarded by beauty blogs and articles as a treacherous part of the body, divulging their owner’s true age.</p>
<p>With help from the press, cinema, advertising and the Internet, women have learned down the years to objectify themselves, to see their bodies as something separate from their self – something that could ‘betray’ them if they don’t placate it with anti-ageing products. Oh the hands, the hands! They’re regarded by beauty blogs and articles as a treacherous part of the body, which has broken ranks by divulging their owner’s true age.</p>
<p>Trying not to age</p>
<p>Body dysmorphia – a distorted sense of one’s body and appearance – used to be considered an individual psychological problem. Today it’s become a cultural condition. Increasing numbers of middle-aged women now have the startled look caused by a facelift – as if they’re puzzling to remember what they really look like.</p>
<p>The media are on permanent age-watch, with celebrities apparently fair game. Newspapers, magazines, Web sites and blogs monitor and police their appearance for signs of ageing, but also for signs of too much ‘work’ to conceal ageing. If they exhibit the normal signs of ageing, famous women look ‘haggard’, but if they take steps to combat it then the headlines sneer ‘Ageing Cher is Losing her Battle to Turn Back Time’ or ‘Does Faye Dunaway Look a Little Ghoulish?’ It’s true that women – and men – who’ve resorted to the scalpel and dermal filler too obsessively look not young but just tragicomically afraid of growing old, but is this surprising?</p>
<p>Older women are at a disadvantage not only because they must strive to look permanently young. After a lifetime of earning less than men, or taking time out to raise children, they’re also likely to be poorer. Far more women over 50 than men have become unemployed since 2010. And older women are most likely to make up the ‘sandwich’ or ‘pivot’ generation, who care for the youngest and oldest members of their family at the same time. It’s enough to give anyone worry lines.</p>
<p>Young and anxious</p>
<p>Yet what’s especially dispiriting is that young women too are now starting to worry about ageing. They see it entirely in terms of appearance, and regard it as a kind of looming disaster. A skincare company which surveyed a large number of them found that they become anxious about ‘losing their looks’ at around 28. Cosmetics brands, of course, encourage this by producing protective ‘serums’ designed for those aged 25-plus and stronger ones in the same range for 30-year-olds. Walmart has even introduced a skincare line, Geo-Girls, for ‘tweens’ – 8- to 12-year-old girls – with cosmetics, and ‘anti-ageing’ creams containing antioxidants. Since these could clog their pores and increase their skin’s sensitivity to sun, they may in fact be damaging rather than protective.</p>
<p>And always there are the anxious celebrities to collude with these trends. Scarlett Johansson started using anti-ageing products at 20 and actress Charice Pempengco, to look fresh-faced for her role in Glee, had Botox at 18. Young women are drenched with news and images of these stars, so it’s hardly surprising that they take in a powerful message about age. A 16-year-old from Oxford told the Independent in 2005, ‘There is definite pressure on us as young people not to look old but to try to look 18, and to stay looking that age even when you are well past it.’ A 17-year-old was blunter: ‘I don’t want to be 50 and look gross.’ So Sontag wasn’t far wrong when she identified the girl’s body as the template.</p>
<p>Which star today would resist having her photos touched up, as Audrey Helpburn did, with the words, ‘No, I’ve earned these lines!’</p>
<p>The causes</p>
<p>The denigration of older women has a long history. Freud wrote in 1913 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is well-known, and has been a matter for much complaint, that women alter strangely in character after they have abandoned their genital functions. They become quarrelsome, peevish, and argumentative, petty and miserly; in fact they display sadistic and anal-erotic traits which were not theirs in the era of womanliness. Writers of comedy and satirists have in all ages launched their invective against the ‘old termagant’ into which the sweet maiden, the loving woman, the tender mother, has deteriorated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Sig.</p>
<p>Of course there’s money to be made out of pathologizing ageing. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has found the medicalization of the menopause extremely lucrative. Today, in Western countries, we think of menopause almost entirely in relation to problems like hot flushes, or increased risks – of osteoporosis, heart disease, stroke – for which medication like hormone replacement therapy is routinely prescribed. But this perspective isn’t universal. The menopause is viewed quite differently in Japan, for instance, where it isn’t seen as a marker of midlife: hot flushes are barely reported (do Japanese women not have them, or not notice them?) and, if there are any ‘symptoms’ of the menopause, they’re – curiously – stiff shoulders.</p>
<p>Researchers Margaret Lock and Patricia Kaufert suggest that this is partly because Japanese women have a different diet from Western women. But their other explanation is more intriguing: so many Japanese women still live in three-generational households that, they suggest, their fifties are seen as the prime of their lives, when they’re at the acme of responsibility. This endows the menopause with a different meaning from that in Western countries, and reveals how much our experience of this stage in the life cycle is shaped by the culture we live in.</p>
<p>The anxious older man</p>
<p>Clive might not be going through the menopause but this doesn’t mean that he’s untouched by concerns about getting older. Indeed, the opposite is true: for a while now he too has been beset by a creeping sense of anxiety. There’s a new egalitarianism abroad: what was confined to women has today spread to men, with age stigmatized in both of them.</p>
<p>Clive’s anxiety was triggered when he read that Gordon Ramsay, at the age of 41, had had the deep crevasses in his forehead and chin plumped out with filler. Clive always thought his own lines and greying hair made him look ‘distinguished’, but he’s noticed a growing number of his colleagues of the same age resorting to the chemical and surgical procedures they’d always dismissed as women’s territory. They reason that, in the world of business start-ups, especially digital ones, you need to emit a sense of dynamism and, well, grey hair and wrinkles suggest the opposite. Clive is seriously wondering whether to follow suit.</p>
<p>A plethora of products and services tailored for men are now on offer, from ‘regrowth formulae’ for baldness to a ‘new anti-age system engineered for men to keep skin looking younger’ (‘system’ and ‘engineered’ making it sound properly un-feminine). ‘We live in a culture of facial discrimination,’ a cosmetic surgeon told the Evening Standard in 2009, ‘and especially if you work in the City, you are judged on how you look. It is no longer the case that wrinkles and grey hair [in men] represent experience.’ ‘Last year,’ said another surgeon, ‘we saw many men who had been made redundant, or who thought they might lose their jobs, who wanted to look better and younger and to be able to compete with the younger guys in the industry.’</p>
<p>Older men have now joined older women as objects of disgust. The ageing rock star is invariably described as ‘grizzled’ and the music he makes ‘colostomy rock’. Tina Turner’s vigorous performing elicits admiration, yet Mick Jagger doing the same earns contempt. And will the sexual older man ever lose the prefix ‘dirty’? The arrival of Viagra has only reinforced this description, confirming them as unreconstructed priapics and libertines. Though what it really demonstrates is precisely the opposite: that male sexuality can be a fragile thing. But then understanding this would require us to put aside too many easy prejudices.</p>
<p>Paul Newman in his sixties: A man with greying hair used to be regarded as distinguished.</p>
<p>Indeed in some sense men have been damaged by the arrival of Viagra, because it encourages them to see their younger selves as the benchmark against which their older sexuality must be compared, and which they must try to recover pharmaceutically. For if older women are invariably judged by their younger beauty, so older men are always assessed by their younger vigour. Whether you’re a man or a woman, you’re not supposed to change, or to enjoy your older self.</p>
<p>Yet if we were more able to have a less sneering and jeering debate about older men and sex, more of them might savour their gentler and slower sexuality, and even discover that their partners find it more erotic.</p>
<p>Fighting back</p>
<p>With rising divorce rates older men as well as women are ‘dating’ again, and both feel under pressure to present a groomed appearance. Ordinary people are increasingly having to try to meet standards of airbrushed looks that were formerly only expected of the young and famous. It’s easy to understand why we feel flattered when told that we don’t look our age. But basking in compliments like these brings only short-term relief. In the long term they’re dangerous: they only allow us to defer our discomfort until the time when we do look our age.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that everyone is equally susceptible to the pressure to deny ageing: those who question and challenge these norms are all around us. Like Barbara, a member of the Hen Co-op:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been conditioned to look at our own bodies through the lens of the advertiser’s camera. But I have come to see my old woman’s body as beautiful in its own way. The full breasts which fed my children … the arms that have worked and nurtured and comforted. Now I fit my own body, I no longer long for it to be different. We should learn not to compare our bodies or devalue them or look at them through other people’s eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbara has found a way of actively resisting the imprecations of the beauty industry, and she’s not alone.</p>
<p>The classicist Mary Beard, whenever she appears on television, has her appearance savaged on social media by trolls. Retorts Beard, ‘Grey is my hair colour. I really can’t see why I should change it. There clearly is a view of female normative behaviour but more women of 58 do look like me than like Victoria Beckham.’</p>
<p>Not all Western women, either, see menopause as a problem to which hormone replacement therapy is the solution. Lucy, 63, recalls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I barely noticed my menopause. I don’t feel smug about it as I’ve got friends who did have a hard time. My life was just so demanding, with work and children and so on, I didn’t have time to think about it. They say you suffer mood swings, but I’m such a volatile person anyway you couldn’t tell the difference. Since then I feel more sexually attractive and my business has taken off. I don’t think these changes have got anything to do with the menopause either: I just know myself better and listen to myself more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only younger women could see that ageing might be like this.</p>
<p>Even among all the prejudice, there’s cause for good cheer too. Because, increasingly, casual ageism and discrimination against older women – and men – is being named and challenged. By women like Beard and Miriam O’Reilly, who at 53 was axed from her job as presenter of TV’s Countryfile in favour of a younger presenter, and took the BBC to a tribunal where she won an age-discrimination case. By the actresses Juliet Stevenson, Lesley Manville and Gemma Jones, who spoke out a few years back about the pressures on older actresses to look younger and the lack of parts written for them. By www.ageimmaterial.org, a British blog discussing issues affecting working women over 50, and ‘Look at Me! Images of Women and Ageing Project’, which challenges stereotypical representations of older women (www.representing-ageing.com), and many more.</p>
<p>Whenever grievances about the invisibility of older women are voiced, paradoxically they reveal how older women are becoming culturally more prominent. They’re speaking out because they aren’t prepared to withdraw from public life and debate purely on grounds of their age and gender. By drawing attention to the stereotyping of the older woman they’re taking the first steps towards destigmatizing and reclaiming the ageing female body. And each time they do so they embolden someone else to reject the idea that ageing is their own personal shame, or that challenging gerontophobia is a hopeless task.</p>
<p>These aren’t just uplifting slogans from the manual of positive thinking. Study any successful movement for social change and you’ll find that it began with this process, of naming and un-shaming. And this is why things are better today than in 1972, when Sontag wrote her essay, even with the endless bile being pumped out by the cosmetics industry. For, back then, she was pretty much a lone voice.</p>
<p>Today, when Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty has used real women over 50, when the National Union of Journalists has helped draw up a charter to try to help raise awareness of the limited and damaging ways in which older women are represented in the media – then you know that change, albeit slow and incremental, is afoot, and that protests, debates and campaigns can have an impact. Participating in them can make you feel that you’re not just the passive recipient of advertising, and remind you how many other people of every age reject insidious ageist propaganda.</p>
<p>The ageing heart</p>
<p>There’s another respect in which things have improved and are improving. Increasingly, popular culture is recognizing that love is not the preserve of the young. The psychotherapist Marie de Hennezel argues that ‘something within us does not grow old. I shall call it the heart. I don’t mean the organ, which does of course age, but the capacity to love and desire. The heart I refer to is that inexplicable, incomprehensible force that keeps the human being alive, and which Spinoza christened conatus: primordial energy or vital endeavour.’</p>
<p>Carola is 68. She’s certain that ‘I’m far more able to love now than when I was in my twenties, thirties or even forties. I was too self-absorbed then to really be able to focus on another person. I was also pretty unforgiving. Now I’m just able to enjoy all the good things about my partner and feel grateful for them.’</p>
<p>Sex</p>
<p>Older women have been desexed for a long time, partly because we associate them with our mothers, with whom sex is taboo. But TV programmes like Sex and the City, with its sexually voracious character Samantha, signalled a change in attitude to older women’s sexuality. Kim Cattrall, the actress who played her, insists that ‘There is no age limit on sexuality’. Inevitably, perhaps, the mass media seized upon this issue of age and sex, and now every second newspaper or Web site, it seems, carries a story about a woman in her thirties or forties having sex with a younger man. Branded the ‘cougar’, she’s been turned into a new stereotype and the butt of humour, as though a couple’s respective ages were the most important thing about them.</p>
<p>Recent British research has discovered that, in reality, sexual relationships continue way beyond the stereotypes, with the majority of 50- to 90-year-olds sexually active. Maggie Kuhn famously urged widows to take younger lovers or have relationships with other women. In the Gray Panthers, she said, ‘we hope that opportunities will be open to people of both sexes to establish deep friendships and loving relationships until rigor mortis sets in.’ Kuhn herself had a sexual relationship with a 21-year-old man when she was 76.</p>
<p>Shirley, a member of the Hen Co-op, describes beautifully how her anxiety, in her late fifties, about exposing her body to a younger lover was slowly replaced by the pleasures of a satisfying sexual experience. And Carola, 68, thinks her sexual relationship is more intense now than when she was younger because she’s more open, and less frightened of being overwhelmed by her feelings. Such women challenge the idea that sexuality is the prerogative of youth.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can learn from Mediterranean countries. Like France, where older women seem to be accorded longer sexual lives. It’s common to see older Frenchwomen, as well as Spanish and Italian women, who look chic and comfortable in their skin, wrinkles and all, as if they hadn’t realized that they were supposed to be put out to pasture. When someone asked the German Princess Palatine in the eighteenth century at what age sexual desire disappeared, she replied, ‘How should I know? I’m only 80.’</p>
<p>Or perhaps we should follow the advice of Agatha Christie. She recommended women marry an archaeologist, like she had, as he regarded a woman as more beautiful and interesting as she aged.</p>
<p>Changing sexualities</p>
<p>Ageing, as we’ve seen, involves both change and continuity. One interesting new phenomenon is that older people are no longer assuming that, just because a relationship is long-standing, if it’s no longer fulfilling it needs to be endured. Increasing numbers of people in their fifties and sixties, for instance, are divorcing, sometimes after decades of marriage: often a birthday, or a brush with illness, causes them to ask ‘is this all there is?’ or ‘do I still have time to develop a richer relationship?’ There’s even a new publishing genre, ‘hen lit’, that fictionalizes the phenomenon. Many of these ‘silver splitters’, as they’ve been called, have turned into ‘silver surfers’ (the terms ‘silver’ and ‘grey’ are certainly getting a good workout these days) who are turning to online dating.</p>
<p>Others, after a lifetime of heterosexuality, find joy and sexual satisfaction in a same-sex relationship. And then there are those who, though they’d like to have a sexual relationship, can’t find one. Some are resourceful. Jane Juska put an ad in the New York Review of Books that read ‘Before I turn 67, next March, I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works fine.’</p>
<p>There’s always the danger, though, that sex in old age becomes the new norm – compulsory, rather than freely chosen. Yet many women identify with the writer Diana Athill, for whom sex was central in her earlier years, but who experienced a falling away of desire with equanimity and without regret. Some feel relieved to be free of the anxiety of sexual encounters: after a lifetime of attending to the needs of others, they’re only too grateful to be able to put their own needs first as they age, and relish the pleasures of being on their own. And let’s celebrate those women who delight in the freedoms brought by age and give themselves permission to wear elasticated waistbands and sensible shoes, comfort finally triumphing over fashion.</p>
<p>For you can’t repeat it too often: we become more different from one another as we age, and not less. There is no template for ageing, or ageing well. The best way is one’s own way.</p>
<p>And love</p>
<p>Sex has so hijacked public discussion that it often squeezes out the many different kinds of love besides sexual. And yet the possibilities of different kinds of love, and different ways of loving, can widen as we age. Grandparents, for example, report themselves surprised by the ferocity – and tenderness – of their feelings for their grandchildren.</p>
<p>Increasingly, also, men and women are coming to see that too much has been expected of sexual relationships, and that, as they age, loving, close friendships can be equally, if not more, sustaining. The women’s movement has made it more possible for women to feel kinship with each other, and not see other women as just rivals. Of course it hasn’t eradicated competitiveness and envy, but it’s allowed women to savour loving and nonsexual – as well as sexual – friendships with other women, and to create networks of support that can last until they die. The first British Older Women’s Cohousing project, set to open in 2015, is a creative new way of maintaining independence while also combating isolation: its first residents, currently aged between 50 and 84, will own or rent their own flat but also have communal areas and will look out for each other.</p>
<p>So, although in some respects ageing has become even harder for women since Susan Sontag wrote about the double standard, especially since anxieties seem to set in now at an increasingly young age, in other respects it’s become easier, with more women drawing attention to stereotypes and discrimination. What’s also changed since Sontag’s essay is that, increasingly, older men too are feeling the effects of ageist prejudice. Perhaps, in time, it will be widely recognized that men and women are both damaged by stereotypes of ageing, even if they’re different ones. Maybe we’ll even see an older men’s liberation movement emerge. Tellingly, if you Google ‘older men’ today what comes up is Dating Older Men.</p>
<p>How does this help us in our own ageing? As with history, so with gender: the more we’re able to understand how ageist assumptions shape our thoughts and behaviour, the less hold they’ll have over us. If you recognize, for example, how far women are judged by their appearance and men by their vigour, you’ll find it easier, as you leave your teens and twenties, to situate and challenge those stereotypes of the woman who’s losing her looks and the man whose vigour is ebbing away. Let’s not delude ourselves: this is the work of a lifetime. And it needs to be done in concert with others. But, as we begin to identify the caricatures and prejudices we’ve internalized and understand their social origins, they become more resistible. And this makes it possible to age more freely – to become more fully ourselves.</p>
