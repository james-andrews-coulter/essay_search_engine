        <h2>HOW NOT TO BE TORTURED BY A LOVE RIVAL</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we are not only left in love; we are left for someone else – a rival who comes to assume a large, indeed monstrous position in our imaginations. The torture comes down to one essential question which pursues us into the early hours:</p>
<p>What do they have that we do not?</p>
<p>Part of the agony rests on a basic feature of human psychology; we know ourselves from the inside, in great and dispiriting detail, whereas we can know others only from the outside, from what they choose to reveal, which may be almost nothing, aside from an attractive face and a charming manner.</p>
<p>As a result, we may feel that the person we have been left for – whom we know only on the basis of having briefly met at a party or by having stalked their online profile – is accomplished in every way. Where we are shy, they will be confident; where we are chaotic, they will be organised; where our sexuality is complex, theirs will be simple; where we’re dull and domestic, they will be exciting …</p>
<p>Well-meaning friends may try to bring us back into contact with our good sides. They may speak of our kindness, intelligence or sense of fun, but this may not be the best way forward; the point isn’t to rehearse how decent we are. To properly get over the pain of a love rival, we need to realise how mediocre pretty much every human who has ever existed tends to be. There is not, in fact, ever any such thing as a ‘perfect person’; there are merely differently tricky ones, as our former partner will inevitably learn.</p>
<p>Our failings or defects may well be real, but the picture we’ve got of ourselves as compared with our love rival is skewed by undue ignorance. Recovery does not involve the denial of our less admirable sides: It requires a more nihilistic, and therefore more balanced sense of what people in general are like.</p>
<p>Of course, the rival has qualities we lack. It is true that they have better hair, or a more impressive salary. But at the same time, they have an enormous number of very serious problems, which we can be assured exist, not because we know them, but because we know human beings in general.</p>
<p>No one examined up close is ever anything other than disappointing. Every person we share a life with will prove at points so maddening, we will, on occasion, wish they had never been born. Whatever attractions a new lover can offer our ex, they will also supply them with a whole new set of irritants, which will end up frustrating them as much as we ever did, indeed more so, because they so sincerely hoped – as they packed their bags – that such flaws would not exist in their next partner.</p>
<p>Our ex-lover has not entered the gates of paradise; they have merely exchanged one imperfect relationship for another. We should never compound our grief with the thought that our ex will be uncomplicatedly happy.</p>
<p>The deep lesson of being supplanted is not that we are so bad. It’s that we have been left because of a common delusion: the belief that if only we were in a different relationship, we would be substantially happier. Yet the truth is that more or less every relationship has its own special and distinct forms of acute unhappiness.</p>
<p>That there is much wrong with us is, of course, true; but this dark fact invariably sits within a far larger, grimmer and yet strangely consoling truth: that every person has much wrong with them.</p>
<p>Once we get over abandonment, the person we need to find is not the one who thinks we are perfect (and will never leave us on this basis), but rather one who can quite clearly see our failings and yet knows how to calmly make peace with them. The lover we need is not someone who stays with us because they think we are irreplaceable, but because they’ve wisely realised that no one is as attractive as they seem at first – and that to destroy a relationship is generally only a prelude to novel encounters with frustration and disappointment.</p>
