            <h3>Getting more serious about pleasure</h3>
<p>When it comes to work, we tend to be strategic and thorough in our approach. We think extensively about where our talents and opportunities lie; we spend years (and a fortune) on training; we devote extraordinary energy (and our most vigorous decades) to progressing up the ladder and we keep a vigilant and jealous eye on the progress of our rivals.</p>
<p>By contrast, our leisure hours promise to be easier. We don’t expect there to be much complexity in this section of existence. We want to relax and have fun, and we tend to envisage that the only obstacles to such goals might be time and money. We adopt a welcoming, unsuspicious manner and readily take up others’ suggestions without gimlet-eyed scrutiny. Sometimes, without thinking about it too much, we end up in a water park or at an aquarium or hosting a barbecue.</p>
<p>What we may miss for many years is the real price of our negligence. We forget that our lives are so much less than they might be because we insist on being haphazard where we might be devotedly analytical. We stick to being guided by hearsay and muddled instinct when we should harness reason and independent reflection; we are a lot more miserable than we might be because we cannot take our own fun more seriously. And we don’t because we are touchingly but ruinously lacking in vigilance about our individuality. We assume that what will work for others will work for us too. It doesn’t readily occur to us to take our uniqueness into account.</p>
<p>A corrective to this costly absence of mind comes from an unexpected quarter: the history of art. What we call a great artist is someone who has learnt to take their pleasure seriously. Most young artists don’t. They like art, of course, but they don’t drill too deeply into what they in particular, as unique beings with a highly individual history, sensory system and temperament, are inclined to like. That is why the chief characteristic of inexperienced artists is derivativeness. Their art reflects what everyone else around them tends to like and make in their particular era and circle. It’s the art of people without a capacity to take their own pleasure seriously.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the career of the Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (1901–1966). Born in the canton of Graubünden, he attended the Geneva School of Fine Arts, and his early work reflects the dominant influences of the times: the work of the Italian artist Giovanni Segantini and of the Impressionist school, especially Édouard Manet and Henri Fantin-Latour. One thinks of Giacometti’s paintings of the Swiss lakes and the surrounding mountains, or of his portraits of family members, such as his sister Ottilia. There is pleasure here, for sure, but not a pleasure with any deep roots in the personality of the creator.</p>
<p>Alberto Giacometti, View on the Sils Lake Towards Piz Lizun, 1920</p>
<p>Alberto Giacometti, Ottilia, c. 1920</p>
<p>Then, in his early twenties, Giacometti left Switzerland for Paris. He broke with his family, thought very hard about who he really was and eventually re-emerged as the great artist we know today: the maker of unique, haunting, elongated figures that speak to us of a longing and a loneliness we may never have been able to identify in ourselves so clearly.</p>
<p>Alberto Giacometti, Walking Man I, 1960</p>
<p>To become an artist in this sense is not about technical discovery; it’s about the strength to discover and then stay faithful to one’s self.</p>
<p>Most of us are not making art. But we are involved in the business of getting to know and please ourselves, as any artist must. For too much of life, we assume that we may be like everyone else. Only gradually, if we are lucky, do we come to see that our characteristic way of drawing pleasure – from nature, books, films, dinner parties, clothes, travels, gardening – bears the imprint and distinctive timbre of our own individuality. To lean on an associated example, we learn how to become proper fetishists. The sexual fetishist is to the ordinary lover like the established artist to the novice: they are someone who has worked out what they really like, and how to hold on to it with rare fidelity and tenacity. While most of us go along with general suggestions of what good sex might consist of, the fetishist discerns their own proclivities. They realise that they might like a particular kind of floral material or a leather watch strap; the sound of water or the feel of a gold chain; a pair of socks or a black monogrammed briefcase. The fetishist is akin to the artist in having the stubborn presence of mind to defend their own tastes, even when these depart from the mainstream.</p>
<p>One thinks in this regard of the modernist architect Le Corbusier’s attachment to including ramps in his buildings, whatever the design challenges or his clients’ objections, or of a lover who dares to ask their partner to put on a pair of ankle-length white athletic socks before entering the bedroom. Great fetishists, like great artists, know the power of details to generate happiness.</p>
<p>Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye, 1928–1931The power of details can make us happy.</p>
<p>By contrast, most of us are fatefully modest about what we enjoy. We don’t dare to foreground our own discoveries. What we do with our leisure hours is therefore marked by a dispiriting uniformity. We go skiing because we hear so often that it’s meant to be fun. We invite guests around for dinner and talk about what everyone else talks about and have melon for a starter because that’s what one is meant to do. Our weekends unfold a bit like those of all our colleagues. We die with our particular appetites and intense sensations tragically unexplored.</p>
<p>To save ourselves, we need the equivalent of an artistic breakthrough. We should be prepared to be redemptively weird across the board in our leisure pursuits. If we were to use only ourselves as our lodestar and point of reference, what would a dinner party look like? What would we eat? What would we talk about? Where would we sit? What have we – the ‘we’ that will be dead in a few decades – enjoyed in the past and what might we recreate going forward? What might a holiday specifically geared to our tastes and proclivities be like? What bit of the standard tourist itinerary might we ditch? Which of our hitherto stray or guilty pleasures might we dare to bring into focus and anchor our days around? What might we learn to say no to and, in contrast, to emphasise going forward?</p>
<p>It is so often drummed into us that we may be selfish and should learn to relinquish our interests for the sake of the community that we fail to notice an even more horrific possibility: that in many areas, we’re not selfish enough. We fail to pay appropriate attention to our fragile, extraordinary and scarce natures. We don’t give outward expression to our true sensations. We don’t give our weekends and our spare time the imprint of our own characters. We kill our uniqueness out of politeness and a fear of being odd. We spend far too much of our brief lives defending an impossible idea: that we are pretty much like anyone else.</p>
