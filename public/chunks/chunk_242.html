        <h3>4 Envy</h3>
<p>Modernity has told us that we are all equal and can achieve anything: boundless possibility awaits every one of us. We too might start a billion-dollar company, become a famous actor, or run a nation. No longer is opportunity unfairly restricted to a favoured few. It sounds charitable but it is a fast route to an outbreak of comparison and its associated pain: envy. It would never have occurred to a goat herder in seventeenth-century Picardy to envy Louis XIV of France; the king’s advantages were as unfair as they were beyond emulation. Such peace is no longer possible. In a world in which everyone can achieve what they deserve, why do we not have more? If success is merited, why do we remain mediocre? The psychological burden of a so-called ordinary life is incomparably harder, even as its material advantages have become ever more available.</p>
