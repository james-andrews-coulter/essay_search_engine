            <h2>VARIETIES OF ANXIETY</h2>
<p>TRAUMA &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>Anxiety belongs in every life. But in some lives, we can fairly say that it has become so constant that it is unnecessarily punishing. What can explain persistent, high-level anxiety that goes far beyond ordinary worry?</p>
<p>We might venture that somewhere in the history of the constantly worried, the bit of our mental equipment designed to distinguish between modest and extreme danger has taken a hit. The very worried have – somewhere along the line – received such a fright that pretty much everything has now grown frightening. Every slightly daunting challenge becomes a harbinger of the end; there are no more gradations. The party where one knows no one, the speech to delegates, the tricky conversation at work…these put the whole of existence into question. Pretty much every day is a crisis.</p>
<p>Let’s go in for a metaphor. Imagine that at a formative moment, when the very anxious would have been profoundly unprepared and without the resources to cope, they had an encounter with a bear. The bear was beyond terrifying. It raged, it stamped, it crushed. It threatened to destroy everything; it was incomprehensibly, mind-defyingly awful. As a result, the anxious person’s inner alarm jammed into the ‘on’ position and has stayed stuck there ever since. There is no use casually telling this person that there aren’t any bears around at the moment, that this isn’t the season, that most bears are kind or that campers rarely encounter them; that’s easy for you to say, you who were never woken up by a giant grizzly staring at you with incisors showing and giant paws held open for the kill.</p>
<p>The result of this bear encounter is an unconscious commitment to catastrophic generalisation; the very anxious fear all bears, but also all dogs, rabbits, mice and squirrels, and all campsites and all sunny days, and even associated things, like trees rustling in the wind, or prairie grass, or the smell of coffee that was being made shortly before the bear showed up. The very anxious can’t do logical distinctions: They can’t rank threats accurately.</p>
<p>To start to dig ourselves out of the quicksand of worry, we – the very, very anxious – need to do something that is likely to feel artificial and probably rather patronising too. We need to learn – on occasion – to distrust our senses completely. These senses, which are mostly terrific guides to life, have to be seen for what they also are: profoundly unreliable instruments, capable of throwing out faulty readings and destroying our lives. We need to erect a firm distinction between feelings and reality: to grasp that an impression is not a prognosis, and a fear is not a fact.</p>
<p>One side of the mind has to treat the other with a robust, kindly scepticism: ‘I know you’re sure there is a bear out there (at that party, in that newspaper article, in that office meeting). But is there one really? Really really?’ Emotion will be screaming ‘yes!’ as if one’s life depends on it. But we’ve been here before and we need, with infinite forbearance, to let the screaming go on a little – and ignore it entirely. The cure lies in watching the panic unfold and in refusing to get involved in its seeming certainties.</p>
<p>We need to be like a pilot of a sophisticated aircraft coming into land in deep fog on autopilot – their senses may tell them that a dreadful collision is imminent, but their reason knows that the sums have been done correctly and that a smooth landing is, despite the darkness and the awful vibrations, about to unfold.</p>
<p>To get better, which really means to stop dreading bears everywhere, we need to spend more time thinking about the specific bear that we once saw. The impulse is to focus always on the fear of the future. But we need instead to direct our minds back to the past – and revisit certain damaging scenes with compassion and in kindly company. A consequence of not knowing the details of what once scared us is a fear of everything into the endless future. What sort of bear was it; what did it do to us; how did we feel? We need to relocalise and repatriate the bear, to get to know it as a spectre that happened at one point in one place, so that it can stop haunting us everywhere for all time.</p>
<p>That we were once very scared is our historical tragedy; the challenge henceforth is to stop giving ourselves ever-new reasons to damage the rest of our lives with fear.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is that the very scared are traumatised. Psychological trauma can be defined as a negative event so overwhelming that one cannot properly understand, process or move on from it – but, and this is the devilish aspect to it, nor can we easily remember it or reflect upon its nature and its effects on us. It is lodged within but remains hidden from us, making its presence known only via symptoms and pains, altering our sense of reality without alerting us to its subterranean operations.</p>
<p>Predictably, a lot of psychological trauma happens in childhood. Children are especially vulnerable to being traumatised, because they are congenitally unable to understand themselves or the world very well – and have to rely to an uncommon degree on parents who are frequently less than mature, patient or balanced. A child may, for example, be traumatised by a parent who – through no particular fault of their own – becomes heavily depressed shortly after childbirth. Or a child may be traumatised through exposure to a parent’s titanic rage or violence. Or, because the widest category of psychological trauma is also the most innocuous, a child may be traumatised by what psychologists term ‘neglect’, which might mean that, at a critical age (between birth and five years old, and especially in the first eighteen months), it was not properly cherished, soothed, comforted and, to use a large but valuable word, loved.</p>
<p>The leading symptom of trauma is fear. Traumatised people are, above anything else, scared. They are scared of getting close to others, of being abandoned, of being humiliated and disgraced, of falling ill, probably of sex, of travelling, of their bodies, of parties, of key bits of their mind and – in the broad sense – of the world. The legacy of having been traumatised is dread, an unnameable, forgotten, unconscious memory of terror and fear projected outwards into a future. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott observed: ‘The catastrophe one fears will happen has already happened.’ That is why, in order to find out the gist of what might have occurred to us long ago, we should ask ourselves not so much about the past (we won’t directly be able to remember), but about what we are afraid will happen to us going forward. Our apprehension holds the best clues as to our history.</p>
<p>Crucially, and surprisingly, it can take a very long time before traumatised people even realise they are such a thing. A leading consequence of trauma is to have no active memory of what was traumatic – and therefore no sense of how distorted one’s picture of reality actually now is. Traumatised people don’t go around thinking that they are unnaturally scared; they just think that everything is terrifying. They don’t notice their appallingly low sense of self-worth; they just assume that others are likely to mock and dislike them. They don’t realise how uncomfortable intimacy is; they merely report not being happy in this or that relationship. In other words, trauma colours our view of reality but, at the same time, prevents us from noticing the extent to which we are peering at life through a distorted lens.</p>
<p>Only with a lot of time, luck, self-reflection and perhaps the odd breakdown do traumatised people come to a position where they start to notice that the way they think of the world isn’t necessarily the way it actually is. It is a vast step towards mental well-being to be able to be usefully suspicious of one’s first impulses and to begin to observe how much fear and self-hatred one is bringing to situations that truly don’t warrant them.</p>
<p>Processing trauma usually works best when we can hook up our own malfunctioning and distorted brain to another more clear-sighted one – and can test our readings of reality against those of a wise friend or therapist. We stand to recognise that – to our great surprise – we are not perhaps inherently disgusting; maybe not everyone hates us; perhaps everything isn’t headed for disaster; maybe we are not in line for a horrific punishment. And, crucially, if we do suffer reversals, maybe we could find our way out of them, because we are (and this can come as a true revelation) now adults, not a nine-month-old infant who underwent something awful.</p>
<p>Overcoming trauma is the work of years – but the beginning of the end starts with a very small step: coming to realise that we might actually be traumatised and that the world may not be the dark, overwhelming and dread-filled place we had always assumed it had to be.</p>
<p>TRAUMA EXERCISE</p>
<p>The leading symptom of trauma is to be daily tortured by a feeling of imminent catastrophe. Something terrible seems about to happen to us:</p>
<p>We’re going to be abandoned.</p>
<p>We’re going to be shamed and humiliated.</p>
<p>We’re going to be publicly mocked.</p>
<p>We’re going to lose physical control over ourselves.</p>
<p>We’re going to be seen as a loser, weirdo or monster.</p>
<p>The fear of such imminent catastrophes leads to a state of hypervigilance, where we are permanently on the alert, permanently worried, permanently scared and permanently really very unhappy. People may try to reassure us, but reassurance goes nowhere; the terror remains.</p>
<p>One way to break the deadlock is to try to go back to the catastrophe that has been forgotten and that is making us sick with worry. If the future is to get brighter, we will need to remember the catastrophe and locate it where it really belongs: safely, but also poignantly and tragically, in the past.</p>
<p>It is strange that we should have forgotten the catastrophe. But that’s the point with trauma; it disappears from memory. It is too painful to be held in active consciousness, to be processed and verbalised – and it therefore gets pushed into the unnameable, unknown zones of the mind, where it creates ongoing havoc.</p>
<p>To start to master trauma, we can reverse engineer a picture of what must have happened long ago, in years that we can’t now easily think about; we can take what we fear of the future and picture that a version of this terror has actually already unfolded. The best clue as to the nature of our difficult past lies in our fears of the future.</p>
<p>Imagine filling in a simple table. Start with the left-hand column first.</p>
<p>The logic of the exercise dictates that we should, for every entry in the left-hand column, be able eventually to think of an entry in the right. Bringing this to the surface is liable to be immensely difficult. One can’t do it on command. It requires time, very relaxed circumstances, perhaps music, a long train or plane journey, a chat with a friend or therapist, a night or two when one stays up very late with a pad and paper and no phone and just thinks while the rest of the world sleeps.</p>
<p>But, eventually, some memories are likely to resurface, along with a lot of sadness and (ideally) compassion for oneself. One isn’t about to be revealed as a monster; one was – already – made to feel like a monster. One isn’t about to be abandoned, one was already left…</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that there is never anything to be afraid of in the present. But we have to draw a distinction between abject terror and fear. There are things to fear in the here and now, but these aren’t things to be terrified of – and for one central reason: because we are adults and it is the privilege of adults to have a basic freedom, agency and independence. We can take action, were bad things to occur to us, in a way that children who were traumatised never could. Life may yet get very tricky for us, but we never need be as terrified of it as we were when the original catastrophe occurred.</p>
<p>Most likely, nothing as bad as we have feared will ever occur, not because we are lucky but because we were very unlucky in the past – and it is this bad luck, rather than something in the real world, that is leading us to be so unjustly and so cruelly afraid of living today. With sufficient exploration of the past, the terror of what is ahead could – just – be relocated to the category of historic trauma where it truly belongs.</p>
<p>SELF-HATRED &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>The temptation, when dealing with anxiety, is always and invariably to focus on the ostensible cause of our worry: the journey to the airport, the forthcoming speech, the letter one is waiting for, the presentation one has to hand in…</p>
<p>But if we proceed more psychologically, we might begin in a different place. With great kindness and no disrespect, we may step past the objective content of anxiety and look instead at something else: how the anxious person feels about themselves.</p>
<p>An unexpected cause of anxiety is self-hatred. People who have grown up not to like themselves very much at all have an above average risk of suffering from extremes of anxiety, for if one doesn’t think one is worthy, it must – by a dastardly logic – follow that the world is permanently and imminently at high risk of punishing one in the way one suspects one deserves. It seems to fit that people may be laughing behind one’s back, that one may soon be sacked or disgraced, that one is an appropriate target for bullying and rejection and that persecution and worse may be heading towards us. If things seem to be going well, this must just be the deceptively quiet period before others are about to realise their error and mete out some horrific punishment. For the self-hating, anxiety is a pre-emptive anticipation of the pain one unconsciously feels one is owed; very bad things must and should happen to very bad people.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, and one of the curious aspects of the way our minds work, is that it isn’t always clear that one is even suffering from low self-esteem; hating oneself has just become second nature rather than an issue one has the will to rebel against or even so much as notice. To tease out the sorrow and start to feel it again (as a prelude to treating it), one might need to fire a few questions at oneself.</p>
<p>A SELF-ESTEEM QUESTIONNAIRE</p>
<ol>
<li>Broadly speaking, I like myself as I am.</li>
</ol>
<p>⚪Agree strongly</p>
<p>⚪Agree</p>
<p>⚪Neither agree nor disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree strongly</p>

<li>People should be relatively grateful to have me in their lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>⚪Agree strongly</p>
<p>⚪Agree</p>
<p>⚪Neither agree nor disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree strongly</p>
<ol>
<li>If I didn’t know me, I’d think I was OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>⚪Agree strongly</p>
<p>⚪Agree</p>
<p>⚪Neither agree nor disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree strongly</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing up, I was given the feeling that I properly deserved to exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>⚪Agree strongly</p>
<p>⚪Agree</p>
<p>⚪Neither agree nor disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree</p>
<p>⚪Disagree strongly</p>
<p>If one finds oneself at the disagreeing end of such questions, it may be that one is an agitated person not because one has more to worry about but because one likes oneself rather less than normal – and certainly less than one fairly should.</p>
<p>The cure isn’t, therefore, to try to dispel anxiety with logic, it is to try to dispel it with love; it is to remind the anxious person (who may be ourselves) that we are not inherently wretched, that we have a right to exist, that past neglect wasn’t deserved, that we should feel tenderly towards ourselves – and that we need, both metaphorically and probably practically too, a very long hug.</p>
<p>The logic of this analysis is truly counter-intuitive. It suggests that when panic next descends, one should not spend too long on the surface causes of the worry but instead try to address the self-hatred fuelling the agitation. Anxiety is not always anxiety; sometimes it is just a very well-disguised, entrenched and unfair habit of disliking who we are.</p>
<p>TRIGGERING &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>If we were totally sane, we would respond to the present only on its own terms; we would worry or give way to anxiety only as much as the circumstances before us actually dictated.</p>
<p>But, of course, most of us are not-quite-sane, as evidenced by the way that we respond with such disproportion to certain events in the here and now. We have occasional tendencies to get wildly more worried and anxious than we should if we were simply following the facts in front of us.</p>
<p>What causes us difficulty is that we are wired to feel and respond according to precedent rather than on the basis of a dispassionate evaluation of the present. In particular we follow emotional tracks laid down in the distant past – when many of us were victims of deeply unrepresentative and unusually painful experiences, from which we continue to make panicky, gloomy and unhelpful extrapolations. In other words, we are, to use the inelegant but useful contemporary term, easily (far too easily) ‘triggered’. That is, situations in the present elicit from us with undue haste responses formed by, and frankly better suited to, a past whose details we have forgotten and whose distinctiveness we cannot now perceive.</p>
<p>A tricky but not objectively existentially troubling email will hence convince us at once that this is the end. An item in the news will plunge us immediately into devastating guilt or boundless fury. The prospect of a party we have to go to or a speech we need to give brings on unbudgeable, monumental terror.</p>
<p>The triggering happens so fast that there is no chance to observe the process and see the way in which we cede our powers of evaluation from present to past. Our minds are simply flooded with panic, we lose our bearings, the rational faculties shut down and we are lost, perhaps for days, in the caverns of the mind. Even worse, not only are we not thinking straight, we’re not quite aware that we aren’t doing so. We mistake our agitated assumptions for sober truths. We’re too panicked to notice that we are in a panic; we insist on our own stability of mind. So, whereas we should logically take to bed and declare ourselves unfit to think or plan ahead, we continue to sit in the cockpit of our lives and try to steer a judicious course.</p>
<p>We get triggered because we don’t have a direct link to objective reality. Each of us approaches the outer world through the prism of an inner world with a more or less tenuous connection to it. In this inner world of ours lies a repository of expectations formed through our unique histories: our internal working models, or our best guesses, of what the outer world will be like, how others will respond to us, what they will say if we complain and how things will turn out when there is a challenge.</p>
<p>Crucially, and this is what we of course miss when we have been triggered, the inner world isn’t the outer world. It contains generalisations and extrapolations from a past that may be far harder, stranger and more dangerous than the present. Psychologists have a handy rule of thumb to alert us to the disproportionate side of our responses: if we experience anxiety or anger above a five out of ten, they tell us, our response is likely to be fuelled not by the issue before us, but by a past we’re overlooking. In other words, we have to believe (contrary to our feelings) that the alarm isn’t ringing for any good reason.</p>
<p>The best way to free ourselves from being so easily triggered is to refuse to believe in most of what overwhelmingly and rapidly frightens or angers us. We must learn to adopt a robust suspicion of our first impulses. It isn’t that there is nothing scary or worrying in the outer world whatsoever, simply that our initial responses are liable to be without proportion or without calculation of adult strength, resilience, resourcefulness or options. We should learn – at points – to try not to think at all until we’ve had a chance to drain the panic from our minds – or else to seek out other minds not as afflicted as ours in order to check our assumptions against theirs. Does it seem to them that the world is coming to an end? Do they think the police really are about to knock on the door? We need to calibrate our thoughts against those of a more equitable temper.</p>
<p>Another way to approach our panic and anxiety is to remember that, despite appearances, we are not a single person or unified ‘I’. We are made up of an assemblage or a blend of parts dating right back to our earliest days. In a way we can’t easily track, different events will engage with different parts of us. Some of our most troubled moments are when a difficulty in the present isn’t handled by an adult part, but by a part formed when we were six months or three years old. We end up so scared because the challenge of public speaking or of a seduction or a worry at work has, unbeknownst to the adult part of us, been left in the hands of a very scared toddler.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, it can help to ask ourselves at points not what ‘we’ are afraid of but what a ‘part’ of us is worried about – and to learn more carefully to differentiate the parts in question. What might we tell a part of us in order for it not to be so scared?</p>
<p>It is a milestone of maturity when we start to understand what triggers us and why – and take steps to mitigate the most self-harming of our responses. Whatever our past seems to tell us, perhaps there won’t be a catastrophe, perhaps we’re not about to be killed or humiliated unbearably. Perhaps we have adult capacities for survival. Too much of our past is inside us in a way we don’t recognise or learn to make allowances for. We should dare to approach many of our triggers like a starting pistol or a fire alarm that we will from now on, for well-grounded reasons, refuse to listen to.</p>
<p>DIVERSIONARY ANXIETY</p>
<p>One of the most difficult features of anxiety is that it tends to be all-consuming. It squats in the middle of our minds and refuses to let anything else in or through. Though the anxiety causes us great pain, it denies any attempts to be questioned, analysed, probed or reconfigured. We are both terrified and unable to think beyond our terror. Our thoughts become low, relentless, repetitive, stymied things: returning again and again to the issue of whether the door is locked, the accounts were signed off or the social media account is not under attack. Anxiety dominates and excludes any other form of mental activity; all that will be in our minds is terror. Impregnable and bullying, anxiety in effect shuts down our central faculties.</p>
<p>But there is one nimble way to try to outwit anxiety – and that is with a question that recognises a fundamental feature of anxiety: that it is frequently a smokescreen for something else, something beyond what we consciously think is worrying us, that we’re in fact concerned with or sad about.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar facets of our minds is that we may choose to feel anxious rather than to confront things that may be yet more painful or emotionally awkward in our lives. It can be easier to fret than to know ourselves properly.</p>
<p>We might feel anxious about whether we’re going to get to the airport on time as an escape from the greater challenge of wondering whether this holiday is even worth it and whether our spouse still loves us. Or we might get intensely anxious about a financial issue in order to avoid a trickier acknowledgement of our confusion at the course of our emotional lives. Or we may develop a sexual anxiety as an alternative to thinking about our sense of self-worth and the childhood that destroyed it. Panic may be invited to shield us from more profound sources of self-aware agony.</p>
<p>And yet, of course, we are always better off getting to the root cause of our troubles, rather than filling our minds with diversionary panic – and in order to do so, we would be wise, at points, to ask ourselves a simple but possibly highly revealing question:</p>
<p>‘If your mind wasn’t currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?’</p>
<p>This question, as simple in structure as it is acute in design, is liable to unlock a moment of original insight.</p>
<p>The answer might go like this:</p>
<p>I might realise how sad and lonely I am.</p>
<p>I might realise how angry I feel towards my partner.</p>
<p>I might realise how abandoned I feel.</p>
<p>And that, of course, is precisely what we should be doing now: processing all the stuff that our anxiety was trying to keep at bay.</p>
<p>Certain anxieties can be taken at face value, for they do clearly relate to worrying things in the world. But there is another class, and a rather large one at that, that is there for no better purpose than to distract us from understanding important parts of ourselves. If we need to suffer, and often we will, the least we can do is to ensure that we are suffering for the right reasons. At points, we should trade our anxiety in for something far more important – a confrontation with the real ambivalence and complexity of our lives – and we should do so thanks to a naively simple question:</p>
<p>‘If your mind wasn’t currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?’</p>
<p>REPUTATION &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>Reputation might be defined as the claim that one can make on the goodwill of strangers; it is what your name will mean to those who don’t know you, who spend almost no time thinking of you. It’s what you will get reduced to when you aren’t illuminated by love. How your reputation is assessed depends on the extent to which you have fulfilled, or violated, the ideals and aspirations of your society. Most of us are properly known to, and liked by, five to ten people. When it comes to everyone else, reputation is what will decide what we have been worth.</p>
<p>Reputation can’t buy us love, but it can provide us with those valuable proxies: respect, honour and politeness. Those who are kind to us may not mean it, but they are at least making an effort. Not all of us crave equally the warmth that comes with a good reputation. Those with a particularly strong need for applause tend to be those with a weak sense of their own acceptability. The cheer of the crowd is asked to compensate for an innate feeling of shame. We seek the validation of the world when we are, inside, unconvinced that we are quite deserving. The more we have been humiliated, especially when young, the more the goodwill of strangers will matter; and – conversely – the more we have tasted genuine affection, the less interesting reputation can be.</p>
<p>The problem is that reputation is gossamer thin; or like a soapy bubble or an unstable chemical compound, some metaphor to suggest the ease with which it can be torn or destroyed. It is so prone to disappear because it is based not on knowledge or experience of one’s deep self but on the candy floss of hearsay and third-hand gossip. It’s the unconscious supposition of people who haven’t thought very deeply about who one is and have absolutely no wish to do so either; it’s what people who don’t care about us think about us. This is what makes reputation so delightful when it is going our way. Our nobility becomes part of the unthinking common sense of the community. But this is also what makes things so tricky when reputation falls apart. The only way in which our good name might be rescued in the minds of others is if they gave us some thought – which is precisely what they have never done before and won’t now begin to either.</p>
<p>Reputation will rise and fall according to how closely we track or depart from the ideals of our society – and these tend to be pegged to financial success, sexual propriety, decorum, marriage, sobriety, the sanctity of family and the purity of children. The more of these ideals one flouts, the harsher will be the penalties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are – all of us – error-prone animals or, to put it more bluntly, idiots. We should say sorry to the universe every day, given how we are. We’re impulsive, greedy, lustful, vain and selfish. Which means that every year, a small but significant section of the population makes an apparently minor mistake that causes terrible damage to others and blows up their life along the way. Not for nothing does Western civilisation have at its heart the example of Greek tragedy, which tells us of averagely good people brought low by highly understandable, everyday kinds of folly, for which they pay an ultimate price.</p>
<p>The whole community hears in an instant and one is done for. The punishment may be financial or legal, but the ultimate damage is psychological; one becomes a pariah. In the minds of all those who don’t think about us properly (which is almost everyone), one is now a monster or a numbskull. For life.</p>
<p>From now on, we will need to be looked at through the eyes of love before we re-emerge as in any way human; that is, deserving of even a little pity or understanding. Only through love can we be remembered to have once been a baby, who was innocent, who struggled and who later made mistakes from passing weakness rather than evil. Only through love are there any other sides of the story.</p>
<p>As a result, all those who are not our intimates become sources of sure-fire damning judgement. We know from the outset that they will hate or condemn us. It becomes impossible to go to a party. One probably has to move town. Suicidal thoughts become harder to push away. Ambitions have to change entirely. Everything that depends on the minds of people in general is now impossible. ‘What people might think’ disappears from the calculation; it’s a foregone conclusion. They’ll think – always – that one is a demon.</p>
<p>When those in disrepute rediscover close friends and family (and they almost always do), it isn’t coincidental or a cheap excuse: it’s because they can see, more clearly than ever, that these are the people, the only people, who know them properly and can therefore examine them with any degree of subtlety, as one might a character in a novel. For everyone else, one has disappeared into a single word of insult.</p>
<p>In older, more religious societies, there was the possibility of apology before a divine being, a period of penance and then, eventually, forgiveness. But that is one of the handy mechanisms we unknowingly dismantled when we decided that God was a fiction. We have been left with only one tool, the legal system, which levies fines and prison sentences but isn’t in the business of restoring reputation – and doesn’t get involved in most of the errors that cause it to be lost in the first place. There is, quite literally, in most cases, no way to recover reputation. The sentence is life-long.</p>
<p>We suffer also because we live in such vast societies. Recovery of reputation might have been possible when we lived in tribes of a hundred or so. You could go around and explain things in person, tent by tent. No such chance when it’s a case of having a few hundred million minds to change.</p>
<p>So begins that peculiar challenge, leading a life without a reputation, a feat as arduous, in a way, as hanging on to a cliff-face with bare hands in high wind.</p>
<p>A few moves suggest themselves. For a start, acceptance: of oneself, of the situation, of one’s misdeeds and of the darkness. Then, the construction of a new kind of communal life, one built around astonishing sincerity and vulnerability. One says it like it is. There is no need for yet more shame. A whole new set of friends is called for – before whom one can be truly oneself, in a way one never could be before things fell apart. It helps immensely if these friends have themselves lost reputation. Ex-convicts might be an idea. And fallen business people and politicians. They will have a kindness to them open only to those who have suffered infinitely for their errors. There is only so much empathy and thoughtfulness that blameless people can ever show. Animals are good too; they rarely judge. The immense open spaces of nature offer valuable perspective, as do history books.</p>
<p>Then one should, above all, make friends with Stoic philosophy in general and the philosopher Boethius in particular. For some 400 years across the European Middle Ages, one philosophy book was prized above any other. Present in every educated person’s library, it was titled in Latin De Consolatione Philosophiae or, as we know it in English today, The Consolation of Philosophy. Editions appeared in all the main European languages: Chaucer translated it into English, as did St Thomas More and Queen Elizabeth I, and Dante made it a centrepiece of the intellectual scaffolding of his Divine Comedy. It is one of the finer things one could read at moments of panic.</p>
<p>The book was the work of the Italian statesman, scholar and academic Boethius, who penned it in a few months in appalling circumstances in a prison in Pavia in 523 A.D. Boethius was born into a highly successful and wealthy family in the years after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. From an early age he took an interest in the Classics and translated much of Plato’s and Aristotle’s works from Greek into Latin; it is thanks, in great measure, to his efforts that classical philosophy made its way into the Middle Ages and then to the modern world.</p>
<p>For many years, Boethius’s life was seemingly blessed. He lived in a sumptuous villa in Rome and was married to a kind and beautiful woman called Rusticiana, with whom he had two handsome, clever and affectionate sons. Under a sense of obligation to his society, Boethius eventually entered politics and occupied a number of elevated administrative positions under the ruler of Italy, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. Bertrand Russell wrote of him: ‘He would have been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly amazing.’</p>
<p>But suddenly, in the spring of 523 A.D., Boethius’s fortune ran out. There was a knock at the door and a gang of Theodoric’s guards accused him (quite falsely) of having plotted against the increasingly paranoid and vengeful king. With scarcely time to say goodbye to his family, Boethius was carted off to prison.</p>

<p>Entirely innocent, but also aware of the danger he was in, Boethius fell into despair. In a tiny cell, he contemplated his rapid fall from grace, his love for his family and the unfairness of his destiny. What would eventually lift his spirits – and, at the same time, gift humanity one of its greatest works of prison literature of any time or place – was his decision to think his way philosophically out of his sorrows.</p>
<p>As The Consolation of Philosophy opens, Boethius describes his listless sadness and terror at his state: ‘White hairs are scattered untimely on my head, and the skin hangs loosely from my worn-out limbs.’ But in this downcast state, Boethius receives an unexpected visit: ‘While I was pondering thus in silence, and using my pen to set down so tearful a complaint, there appeared standing over my head a woman’s form, whose countenance was full of majesty, whose eyes shone as with fire and whose power of insight surpassed that of all men….’</p>
<p>His visitor is a metaphorical figure whom Boethius terms Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy is carrying a pile of classical books in one hand and a sceptre in the other – and she has come to visit Boethius in his cell in order to remind him of some of the fundamental truths of his favourite subject, largely as defined by the Stoic school of Greece and Rome. That she should have dropped in on him was, in a sense, no surprise. In the classical world, philosophy was not an abstract academic discipline; it was a set of tools specifically designed to help one live and die well, with particular relevance at the darkest moments.</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy begins by gently chiding Boethius for ‘flaring up against’ his fate. She reminds him, as Stoic philosophers had constantly stressed, that human beings are not in control of most of what happens to them. Our destiny is, in large measure, in the hands of a devilishly powerful seductive goddess whom the Romans knew as Fortuna, the Goddess of Fortune. This figure was a central deity in the Roman pantheon and was represented across the Roman world on coins and statues. She was typically depicted holding a cornucopia in one hand, overflowing with fruit and luxuries, and in the other a tiller, a marker of her capacity to direct people’s fates. Depending on her mood, Fortune might either shower us with gifts or, with a blithe smile, steer us towards catastrophe.</p>
<p>To be a philosopher means to understand all that Fortune controls, to resist her blandishments, to know never to put complete faith in the things that are, ultimately, always in the hands of an immoral and reckless force – and to prepare for the day when we may have to surrender her gifts at a stroke. These gifts comprise most of what we would today think of as the fundamental ingredients of happiness: love, family, children, prosperity, reputation and career. But, for a Stoic philosopher, none of them should be things that the wise should ever really trust – for all of them can be lost in horrific circumstances at any moment.</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy sits with Boethius in his cell and reminds him of his appalling exposure to Fortune’s deceptive charm: ‘I know the many disguises of that monster, Fortune, and the extent to which she seduces with friendship the very people she is striving to cheat, until she overwhelms them with unbearable grief at the suddenness of her desertion.’</p>
<p>But Lady Philosophy also reminds Boethius that the wise have to resist putting their faith in the gifts of Fortune. She introduces a famous image of a Wheel of Fortune, which spins between success and favour – and appalling punishment and pain. Fortune spins the wheel with abandon and merciless cruelty, enjoying the screams of those who, only hours before, were confident of their future.</p>
<p>‘If you are trying to stop her wheel from turning, you of all men are the most obtuse,’ Lady Philosophy tells Boethius. ‘You are seeking to regain what really did not belong to you.’</p>
<p>Fortune herself pipes up at this point and says with chilling candour: ‘Inconstancy is my very essence; it is the game I never cease to play as I turn my wheel in its ever changing circle…. Yes, rise up on my wheel if you like, but don’t count it an injury when by the same token you begin to fall, as the rules of the game will require…. Isn’t this what tragedy commemorates with its tears and tumult?’</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy now gets to the heart of her message. Boethius must, like any good philosophically inclined person, stop trusting in anything that Fortune can take away at once: ‘You know there is no constancy in human affairs, when a single swift hour can often bring a man to nothing. If you are in possession of yourself you will possess something you would never wish to lose and something Fortune could never take away…. Happiness cannot consist in things governed by chance.’</p>
<p>Boethius must retreat to what the Stoic philosophers called his ‘inner citadel’; a minimal self immune from the cruelty of Fortune. Lady Philosophy stresses that a different sort of happiness can be found by focusing on all that Fortune can never make one lose, specifically one’s powers of reasoning, which give one access to the beauty, mystery and complexity of the universe. True philosophers rise above their immediate circumstances, become indifferent to their own fate and identify with the vast forces of history and nature.</p>
<p>It’s a measure of the relevance of Boethius’s message that we today so firmly identify happiness with two areas that lie entirely in the hands of Fortune: romantic love and career success. And, unsurprisingly, we are continually let down here, too, the wheel of fortune spinning us randomly from promise to disgrace, from hope to ruin. Boethius’s provocative message to his own times and to our own is that the best way to find peace of mind may be to perceive the ingredients we associate with happiness as, in truth, direct conduits to a fundamental instability, and thereby to inner torment and anxiety.</p>
<p>Boethius’s wisdom was to be the last eloquent outcry of the guiding ideas of classical philosophy and, in particular, its Stoic branch. Thereafter, Christianity subsumed its insights, which were then further obscured by the scientific optimism of the modern period.</p>
<p>Our own troubled times deserve to witness the rediscovery of the Stoic message. We become philosophers not by writing books or attending university courses, but by appreciating how little of our lives is in our hands, the ubiquity and fickleness of Fortune and our need to look beyond public opinion, family, love and status in order to build up serenity through the exercise of one’s distinctive and fate-independent mental powers.</p>
<p>Boethius was killed, as he feared, a few months after being imprisoned. His grave lies in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d’Oro in Pavia, half an hour from Milan. In his honour, we should leave space for Lady Philosophy occasionally to come and visit us – and, when we are facing the worst turns of Fortune’s wheel, let her strengthen our resolve to depend a little less on what was, in fact, never really ours to rely upon.</p>
<p>FRIENDSHIP &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>We all require truly good friends; but those among us who suffer from high anxiety need them especially badly, for one of the principal solutions to anxiety is – as we shall see – the company of the right kind of others.</p>
<p>However, we tend too quickly to think we know what we mean by a ‘good friend’. It is easy to confuse the genuine with the ersatz article. Both may show up for dinner, both may seem outwardly kind, both will claim to be loyal – but only one will live up to the true calling of the word ‘friend’ and so stand any chance of sincerely assisting the soul of the anxious.</p>
<p>Here is some of what makes a genuinely good friend.</p>
