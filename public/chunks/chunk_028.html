        <h3>7. A resistance to parties</h3>
<p>The idea of being a friend-worthy person can be heavily associated with finding enjoyment in going to, and in all likelihood also in giving, parties. To be sociable means welcoming the idea of being in a room replete with an above-average number of other guests, many of whom will be strangers, most of whom will be holding a glass of alcohol, bantering, with lights lower than they normally would be, and music somewhat higher than required in order to catch the details of another’s voice.</p>
<p>Parties have become synonymous with sociability because of certain underlying ideas about what true social connection might require and entail. We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room, that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully about things that have been happening in our lives, that it depends on a jokey manner and – ideally – on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences.</p>
<p>But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. Firstly, true sociability – that is, a real connection between two people – is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing something that is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing, in an uncensored and frank way, a little of the agony and confusion of being alive.</p>
<p>Secondly, true sociability requires an encouraging context. And at parties, sadly, we are generally under unhelpful pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, to the extent that we cannot possibly disclose anything much of our true selves. Our default mode will be – without anything sinister being meant by this – to lie about who we are and what is sincerely going on in our lives.</p>
<p>This suggests that a genuinely social occasion might be rather different from what we typically envisage. We think of a ‘good host’ as someone who makes sure there is enough wine and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other’s names. But in the profound sense, a good host is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe about sharing the more authentic parts of themselves, even the sad and desperate parts.</p>
<p>A commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise that we depend on a little artful choreography to get us into the psychological zone in which connections can unfold. We might need tact and skill to share a little of what is sad within us. We need help to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair.</p>
<p>Parties as they are currently structured constitute a clever ruse by a minority, perhaps only ten per cent of humanity, to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave. But, in truth, it takes an insular and misanthropic person to feel that what goes on at an average party really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one’s fellow human animal. If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches. It doesn’t mean that we don’t like other people, but rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact to put up with what is on offer at most parties. The mark of a truly sociable person might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.</p>
