            <h2>REVISITING OUR YOUNGER SELVES</h2>
<p>For many of us, childhood was a traumatically confusing and lonely time as we were placed in circumstances that far outstripped our ability to understand, contextualize, and properly apportion blame. As a result, we have grown up fundamentally mistaken about who we are and what we might deserve.</p>
<p>Returning to health can involve learning to go back to the child we once were, seeing ourselves in all our early helplessness and confusion, and bringing ourselves the benefit of adult compassion and insight. A visual metaphor for what this might involve comes in the work of the Japanese photographer Chino Otsuka, who, in a project called “Imagine Finding Me,” located old pictures of herself in a variety of childhood settings and then inserted her current self next to the child she once was. Thirty-three-year-old Otsuka slipped in beside ten-year-old Otsuka outside a boulangerie in Paris, popped up next to her on a beach in Japan, and, one winter, gave her a hand with a snowman she was building after a heavy snowfall.</p>

<p>This deceptively simple idea latches on to a powerful fantasy: that the older us could go back to help the younger us. How extraordinary it would be if we could give our comparatively frail and bereft tiny self the benefit of our adult strength, experience, poise, and confidence. If only we could return to provide ourselves with answers, to explain the adults around us and sometimes just to offer ourselves a consoling hug. We would be much more able now to navigate what we endured with such pain then. We would tell ourselves not to worry, we would guarantee that we were lovable and precious, we would hold ourselves through the long nights.</p>
<p>This might sound merely fantastical, but in fact it has practical applications in therapy. The reality is that our childhood selves still exist: their ghosts still wander around the old vacation destinations, they’re still having bath time in the old house, they’re still at school on winter mornings, and they are still crying at night in bed. No part of us ever really dies; our younger selves continue at some concurrent level in the unconscious and will cause us pain for as long as they remain fearful and abandoned.</p>
<p>The priority is therefore to go back and, just like Otsuka in her project, stand beside our younger selves in all their difficulties. We should slip into our bed the night we were sobbing after having been shouted at. We should take ourselves to school and sit at the desk next to ours and tell ourselves what we so needed to hear but never did. We should stand up to particular adults and make the speeches we were too inarticulate to utter. Our lost sad child is still inside us and won’t let us rest until we have been able to witness and appease them.</p>
<p>Through therapy, we will get better once we have located the scenes that truly matter and then comforted and reparented ourselves back to health.</p>
<p>For all these life-saving functions of therapy, we should add that most therapists will not match the exalted hopes we have of them. This merely reflects the realities of the distribution of talent—which we should be ready for and accommodate ourselves to. Just as we can have the highest estimation of art but still find most practicing artists mediocre, so most therapists we come across are likely to be less than what they should be. We shouldn’t despair or blame the profession as a whole; we should trust our instincts, politely leave, and keep searching until we find someone with the kindness, intellectual grit, humor, insight, and warmth we need. We will be very lucky if we find this therapeutic figure at once, but the eventual prize should make even the longest search worthwhile.</p>
<p>7 Modernity</p>
<p>People have fallen prey to mental illness for as long as our species has been in existence, so it could sound naive or punitive to single out any one era as especially responsible for generating mental troubles. Nevertheless, certain periods of history seem capable of bringing together such a confluence of aggravating factors and of so perfectly testing our emotional limits that they deserve to be considered as causes of mental unwellness in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Such may be the case with our own era, a time known as modernity which, notwithstanding its extraordinary technological creativity, overall peaceability, and increasing wealth, has imperiled our mental health as few ages before it ever have. The illnesses bequeathed to us by modern times may manifest themselves very personally within us, but a great many of their causes lie in the broader dynamics of society, economics, and politics.</p>
<p>We would do well to identify the myriad ways in which our age renders our mental lives more challenging than they should be—and then find techniques to sidestep the worst of our contemporary ills.</p>
