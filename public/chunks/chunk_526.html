        <h2>In Praise of Procrastination</h2>
<p>We’re so alive to the problems of procrastination that we can overlook the fact that there might be a few things to value in the condition. Precisely speaking, the word procrastination only means waiting, until tomorrow – or a more distant day. And sometimes, at least, that’s a very wise and helpful thing to do.</p>
<p>Cherry trees, for example, procrastinate a lot. It might be five or seven years before a new tree bears fruit. An olive tree might require twelve years. But the fruit that emerges from such slow gestation bears witness to the advantages of procrastination, being rich, experienced and redolent of a succession of long summers and sharp winters.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to procrastinate around having sex with someone or around choosing a career; we can be legitimately too young to drive or to leave home, to run our own business or to put up a building.</p>
<p>There are many important tasks we can’t hurry: we can’t make our children grow up quickly; we can’t write a good novel too fast; we can’t successfully complete psychotherapy in a few days; it can take years to assemble our ideas about how to direct an enterprise or structure a department...</p>

<p>The French painter Ingres, working in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, dithered for decades over some of his most impressive works. He started his painting of Oedipus and the Sphinx in 1808, when he was in his late twenties, but didn’t complete it until 1827, by which time he was in his late forties.</p>

<p>In the intervening years he changed many details, he repainted some parts many times and he added extra portions of canvas to the top and the sides.</p>
<p>Our society is very good at honouring certain kinds of speed. We’re impressed by how quickly some people can run or drive a car. But we’re much less familiar with the (equally important) idea of honouring those who precisely didn’t do something quickly – and did it well because they did it very slowly.</p>
<p>During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), the brilliant Carthaginian general Hannibal invaded Italy and reached the walls of Rome. Fabius Maximus was appointed to lead the defence of his country, but instead of immediately giving battle, he deliberately kept out of reach of the enemy. He harried their supply lines and kept them on the move and prevented reinforcements arriving. There was minimal bloodshed. Unable to sustain his campaign, Hannibal finally withdrew from the Italian peninsula and the nation was saved. Fabius Maximus procrastinated not out of cowardice or stupidity, but because this was the wiser, more humane and more effective strategy.</p>
<p>By remembering the trouble impatience brings into our lives, we can gain an unexpected degree of admiration and sympathy for procrastination. It’s not in principle a bad quality – it’s just that we don’t always use it in the right manner. It’s not so much that we should try to stop procrastinating in all ways; the ideal is to direct our ability to delay to the places where this move is most useful.</p>
