        <h1>1. Hidden Calendars</h1>
<p>‘The Sun, with all those planets revolving around it and dependent on it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else to do.’</p>
<p>(GALILEO GALILEI)</p>
<p>Five hundred years ago, a young girl called Pepita lived in a small village in Mexico. On Christmas Eve, Pepita made her way to church with the other children from the village.
  She could see that all the others were carrying beautiful gifts for the baby Jesus. Pepita was sad as she did not have enough money to buy even the smallest of gifts for Jesus. Pepita’s
  cousin, Pedro, put his arm around her shoulders as they walked together,</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry, Pepita, even the most humble gift, if given in love, will be acceptable in the Lord’s eyes.’</p>
<p>Pepita bent down and gathered a small bunch of the green weeds that lined the lane. At the church she placed the green plants at the altar and said her prayers. The other children laughed at
  her.</p>
<p>‘Do you think Jesus wants your weeds, Pepita?’</p>
<p>Pepita cried and ran out of the church. She sat on her own and wept, listening to her friends singing inside. Then she walked home all alone.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, Pepita and Pedro walked to the church together again, but Pepita refused to go in.</p>
<p>‘You go, Pedro, the others will just laugh at me because I am so poor.’</p>
<p>Pedro could not persuade his cousin to join him in the church and he went inside, leaving Pepita sitting all alone outside once more.</p>
<p>Then Pedro rushed out.</p>
<p>‘Come, Pepita, come! Quick!’</p>
<p>Pedro led his cousin back inside the church and pointed towards the altar. The green plants had turned a vibrant red and the whole congregation stood in silence. They were staring in
  amazement.</p>
<p>The legend of the poinsettia miracle, like all good legends, contains kernels of truth and insight. Poinsettias are ‘short-day’ plants, which means they are very
  sensitive to the number of hours of consecutive darkness they are exposed to.</p>
<p>As the nights lengthen towards the end of the year, poinsettias turn red. It is actually the leaves of the plant that change colour, although the effect is so vivid that they are regularly
  confused with flowers.</p>
<p>The poinsettia has become a plant that is symbolic of Christmas in many parts of the world, and in their native Mexico poinsettias are known as ‘Flores de Noche Buena’,
  ‘Flowers of Christmas Eve’. Commercial growers will manipulate the time at which the plants turn red by controlling the length of night artificially. Home growers can accelerate the
  change in a similar way, by placing the plants in a dark place – a church, in Pepita’s case.</p>
<p>Contained within this legend are the keys that help make some sense of time. What is time? What is a year? Is it 365 days, or twelve months or a financial-accounting period? Or is it a
  succession of changes that surround us: frosts followed by snowdrops, primroses, bluebells, leaves on the trees, cuckoos, swallows, wildflowers, berries, fungi, turning leaves, gales and another
  frost?</p>
<p>Or is a year closer to this: central heating, flood warnings, flu, treacherous roads, clocks going forward, Easter eggs, the football season ending, a beach holiday, the football season starting
  again, clocks going back, kids playing conkers (in magazines but nowhere else), time to buy a new coat, Christmas?</p>
<p>The way we view a year is a good measure of our connection with nature, because a failure to notice dramatic change is symptomatic of a relationship that is on weak ground. Think of the person
  who goes on a health drive, loses a stone, changes their hairstyle, gets a spray-on tan one morning and buys a whole new wardrobe that afternoon. If this scale of change goes unnoticed by their
  other half, this is a relationship that may be in some peril.</p>
<p>One annoying mistake that a lot of nature enthusiasts make is to cajole people to appreciate the changing seasons. What a waste of everybody’s time that sort of sentiment is. Yes,
  nature’s seasonal displays are the greatest shows on earth, but we can only come to love and understand them by getting to know the minor characters. Trying to take in the whole show in one
  go is the sort of challenge that God might find entertaining, but even He would probably feel the need for a sit down with a cup of tea and a biscuit afterwards.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapters, we can start to make sense of the vast canvas around us by moving from the big relationships, the broad brushstrokes of habitat-knowledge, to the finer
  connections, the species within those habitats. This narrowing from broad to fine focus is what allows us to make sense of our natural surroundings in the moment. This approach helps us to make
  decisions about the aspects of the nature matrix that we find most intriguing. The area we end up taking most interest in comes down to a personal decision – birds are no better than bees,
  bass or buddleias – but once made, it is this interest in a particular area that allows us to begin to unravel the melees of change that are the seasons.</p>
<p>Every meaningful gauge of time will find its roots in the daily revolution of the earth, the annual orbit of the earth around the sun and the regular changes in weather, plant
  and animal life patterns that follow as a consequence. While nobody is oblivious to the broadest changes in their environment – those that occur between summer and winter – almost
  everybody has lost contact with the subtler patterns of change that surround us. It does not matter whether we look at the habits of the sun, the night sky or the smallest of plants, we can
  rediscover lost calendars.</p>
<p>Sky Calendars</p>
<p>Necessity led our ancestors to a very practical relationship with the stars. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and the ancient Egyptians used its appearance to
  predict the annual flood of the Nile. Early cultures across the world found their patterns of life tied to what they saw above them: aboriginal Australians traditionally began cultivation when the
  Pleiades, or the ‘Seven Sisters’, appeared.</p>
<p>If we are keen to regain this lost connection with time in the night sky, then language can help. Sometimes the clues in the names of shapes in the sky are obvious, like the Summer and Winter
  Triangles; sometimes they require a little more thought and cultural immersion. Virgo is usually depicted holding an ear of corn, symbolizing summer. Aries is the ram, ancient symbol of fertility
  and hence a spring constellation.</p>
<p>Natural navigators have to learn quickly that the sun rises and sets in a slightly different place each day and this direction varies massively over the course of a year. In midwinter in the UK,
  the sun rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest, but in midsummer the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. When it comes to sunrise and sunset, time and direction are two
  sides of the same coin; if you know one then you can deduce the other. The ancients approached this relationship from the opposite side to the navigator. If you wish to learn how to use the sun as
  a calendar, then it is a good idea to emulate the ancients in their approach.</p>
<p>If you mark the point where the sun rises over the course of a year using stones viewed from a fixed point, then you have a calendar. We can find these calendars still standing, both in places
  with names that are familiar, like Stonehenge, and in less familiar locations spread across the Bronze Age landscape. If you can see either sunrise or sunset from the same place over the course of
  half a year or more, then this is something it is well worth trying yourself. There is no need to haul giant stones to the summit of a hill; marks on a windowsill can create the same effect, and an
  equally accurate calendar.</p>
<p>The Ring of Brodgar at sunset, Orkney, Scotland. Any structures that line up with the sunrise or sunset like this, however modest, create a calendar.</p>
<p>Ground Time</p>
<p>Even the shortest walk can be a tour of wondrous natural calendars, clocks and thermometers. Most plants stop growing below about 6°c, but each plant and animal will
  respond to light and temperature in a unique way, which can be read with practice.</p>
<p>At its simplest level this process begins with the realization that there are windows of opportunity whatever our interests are. Flowers, fish, fungi and fowl will make it quite clear to us
  early on that they have a calendar and a schedule. Part of becoming a nature-lover is a reconciling of diaries. Sometimes this can be done casually – we look out for the first swallows each
  year in a laid-back way – but occasionally, a more formal arrangement is needed. The reindeer in Lapland begin their summer migration with an eerie punctiliousness: they set off on 29 July
  each year.</p>
<p>There isn’t a scientist on earth who could possibly offer insight into even 10 per cent of the natural global change that takes place during the course of one year, and yet every single
  person who develops a connection with nature will be able to relate some of the annual narrative within their area of interest. And these stories will get more detailed with each passing year.</p>
<p>If, for example, we develop an interest in trees, this will inevitably start with an awareness of the most dramatic patterns: spring leaf growth and autumnal shedding. Before long, curiosity
  will have revealed that plants are sensitive to the length of night, and that it is this that gives them an ‘awareness’ of season. (Commercial strawberry growers like to put the light
  on in the middle of the night; five minutes is all it takes to turn one long night into two short ones for the plants. Winter becomes summer at the flick of a switch.)</p>
<p>During the following year of tree-watching, the golds and reds of falling leaves may reveal yet more interest behind the beauty, because we have learned that the trees use this time to filter
  out toxins, and that any poisonous metals that they have drawn up from the soil during the course of the previous year will be urgently ushered into these falling leaves and sent on their way. The
  golden leaves take on a fresh metallic sheen in our minds.</p>
<p>My passion for natural navigation means that I have become well versed in the dark and light arts that are phototropism, gravitropism and thigmomorphogenesis (the way plants grow in response to
  light, gravity and touch respectively). I love using trees as a compass, and this practical curiosity led quickly to a more academic curiosity, because the only way I could answer the questions I
  had was to learn about the way trees respond to sunlight, gravity, wind and time. (You know you’ve got the nature bug pretty bad when you’re spending evenings reading academic research
  papers about the weight of tree roots in another country . . . for fun.) This has in turn led me to understand many annual changes in trees, allowing me to connect with time in a deeper and more
  intriguing way each time I take a walk. At its simplest level, I notice things like the way you can estimate the age of a young conifer tree by counting the number of lateral branch whorls. At a
  deeper level, I recognize late autumn as the time when I can first read direction from the shape of tree branches at a distance. (Tree branches on the southern side are more horizontal than the
  northern side, because of phototropism.)</p>
<p>Similarly, an interest in birds will lead to an awareness of the way sensors in a bird’s brain respond to varying light levels and times. The migratory habits of birds stimulate our
  interest in seasonal change like nothing else. They come and they go. And in that sentence lie joys and mysteries that have filled a thousand books or more.</p>
<p>How old is this conifer? The levels of branch whorls reveal all.</p>
<p>Anglers will take great pleasure in knowing the seasonal habits of trout or salmon in a way that might surprise the fish themselves, should a frank discussion between the two camps ever take
  place.</p>
<p>Each autumn, red admiral butterflies depart our shores for the second-home, sherry-steeped brochure-land of Andalucia in Spain. Here they lay their eggs and die. No species is immune to the
  rhythms beat out by the sun. We certainly aren’t: have you ever tried driving to Cornwall at the start of the summer holidays?</p>
<p>The Rebels</p>
<p>Species that rebel against seasonal norms are loved for their courage. The mistle thrush that can be heard to sing when all other birds have turned shy, even during winter
  gales, earns our respect, and his nickname, ‘stormcock’, comes alive on the wind. The red berries and dark-green leaves of holly have found their way onto Christmas cards and earned a
  little fondness, despite their prickles, because they refuse to let their colours be bowed by a decrease in daylight or a blanket of snow. Gorse will flower at any time of year, and our love of
  this resilience can be found in the old saying, ‘Gorse is out of bloom when kissing’s out of fashion’.</p>
<p>If we love the natural rebels, then there are some very mixed feelings about species that have been made to rebel artificially. People might feel differently about the availability of tomatoes
  in winter if they knew that their ripeness has been achieved by the introduction of cold-resistant genes taken from fish.</p>
<p>It is not only the plants and animals that can rebel. We can, too, by doing things that gently shock the senses. A cold winter night walk can reset the senses and introduce new joys to a
  landscape that we thought we knew too well.</p>
<p>The things that mark time for us can reveal our interests and, since our interests go some way to defining us, we can learn a lot about a person by asking the question,
  ‘What does spring mean to you?’</p>
<p>Try it on someone if you don’t believe me. When they ask what you mean by your question, do not be deterred. Lean forward and repeat your question, speaking clearly and slowly. Now smile
  and whisper in their ear, ‘Spring has come when you can cover seven daisies with one foot.’</p>
<p>And then do a traditional spring fertility dance. This is all essential.</p>
