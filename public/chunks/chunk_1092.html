        <h3>2The fear of happiness</h3>
<p>It is normal to expect that we will always – almost by nature – actively seek out our own happiness in love.</p>
<p>It is therefore odd and a little unnerving to find how we can in love sometimes act as if we were deliberately trying to ruin our chances of getting what we wanted. When going on dates with candidates we are keen on, we may suddenly lapse into unnecessarily opinionated and antagonistic behaviour. Or when we are in a relationship with someone we love, we may drive them to distraction through repeated unwarranted accusations and angry explosions – as if we were somehow willing to bring on the sad day when, exhausted and frustrated, the beloved would be forced to walk away, still sympathetic but unable to take our elevated degree of suspicion and drama.</p>
<p>Such behaviour can’t be put down to mere bad luck. It deserves a stronger, more intentional term: self-sabotage. We are familiar enough with the fear of failure, but it appears that success can bring about as many anxieties, which may culminate in a desire to scupper our chances of happy love in a bid to restore our peace of mind.</p>
<p>There is a basic truth at the heart of this worry: when we love someone, we risk loss. They could turn against us, succumb to a rare illness, or turn their attentions elsewhere. There is no way these possibilities can ever be entirely eliminated. What is distinctive about the self-saboteur is not that they are aware of the possibilities of loss, but that these possibilities affect them so acutely.</p>
<p>As ever, an explanation has to start with childhood. The self-saboteur is one who has grown to find the price of hope too high to pay. We may, when we were younger, have been exposed to brutal disappointments at a time when we were too fragile to withstand them. Perhaps we hoped our parents would stay together and they didn’t. Or we hoped our father would eventually come back from another country and he stayed there. Perhaps we dared to love an adult and, after a period of happiness, they swiftly and oddly changed their attitude and let us down. Somewhere in our characters, a deep association has been forged between hope and danger, along with a corresponding preference to live quietly with disappointment, rather than more freely with hope.</p>
<p>The solution is to remind ourselves that we can, despite our fears, survive the loss of hope. We are no longer those who suffered the disappointments responsible for our present timidity. The conditions that forged our caution are no longer those of adult reality. The unconscious mind may, as is its wont, be reading the present through the lenses of decades ago, but what we fear will happen has, in truth, already happened; we are projecting into the future a catastrophe that belongs to a past we have not had the chance to fathom or mourn adequately. We are suffering from a localised immaturity: an archaic part of us remains as it was when we were a child. It has not been able to grow and shed its terrors. The intensity of the fear is based on the idea that we can only bring childhood resources to the problem. We still feel the same age as we were when we met a horrendous loss.</p>
<p>But, in fact we’re big now. We have the capacity to cope very well. Should this relationship fail, we’ll be sad for a while but won’t actually be destroyed. We are not in as much danger as the primitive part of the mind thinks – and as we once were. We are no longer the children for whom loss was unbearable.</p>
