        <h3>¶ Anxious Attachment</h3>
<p>Anxious attachment is a pattern of relating to lovers whereby, when difficulty arises, we grow officious, procedural and controlling over small matters of domestic routine.</p>
<p>We feel our partners are escaping us emotionally, but rather than admitting our sense of loss, we respond by trying to pin them down administratively. We get unduly cross that they are eight minutes late; we chastise them for not having done certain chores; we ask them strictly if they’ve completed a task they had only vaguely agreed to undertake. All this rather than admit the truth: ‘I’m worried that I don’t matter to you…’</p>
<p>We can’t (we believe) force our partner to be generous and warm. We can’t force them to want us, even if we haven’t asked them to. So we try to control them practically. The goal isn’t really to be in charge all the time; it’s just that we can’t admit to our terror at how much we need them. A tragic cycle then unfolds. We become shrill and unpleasant. To the other person, it feels like we can’t possibly love them anymore. The truth is that we do: we just fear rather too much that they don’t love us. As a final recourse, we may ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about their extensive practical shortcomings. Anything rather than ask the question that disturbs us so much: does this person love me? If this harsh, graceless, anxious behaviour could be understood for what it truly is, it would be revealed not as a rejection, but as a strangely distorted, yet very real and very touching, plea for tenderness.</p>
