        <h3>(vi) Tolerating ambivalence</h3>
<p>One of the ideas about which therapy remains most sanguine is that our feelings are seldom pure. There is rarely a love that is not, at some level, accompanied by a kind of hatred, just as there is rarely a disdain that doesn’t have a strand of affection concealed somewhere within it.</p>
<p>Therapy knows that there are few loving mothers who do not, at points, wish their babies dead. And there are few respectful, affectionate children who do not fantasise that their parents might be annihilated, if only for a while. It knows, too, that it’s wholly normal to love someone and fantasise about having sex with someone else; or to completely forget why we ever committed to a partner only to recover the thread of our story a few hours later. Therapy is unbothered by the strangeness of our disloyal or entangled feelings. It knows that we are all a good deal stranger than we’re allowed to admit and it lets us be as unconventional as is helpful without judging or taking fright.</p>
<p>A lover schooled in therapy can adopt a similar sang-froid. Of course there will be moments of intense hatred and declarations of catastrophe and panic, but this is no reason to think a relationship is doomed – just as a 2-year-old child who bites their mother in a fit of frustration in the kitchen is not to be understood as making any long-term statement about their feelings for their progenitor. With the example of therapy in mind, we’ll be less upset by squalls, less frightened of viciousness and better able to hear with wry patience that we are apparently a shitfaced bastard who ruined someone’s life – only, ten minutes later, to hear an addendum that we are also someone our partner will love for eternity. Anger and irritation don’t destroy love; they are inevitable parts of being genuinely close to and extremely dependent on another human being.</p>
<hr />
<p>A therapeutic attitude taps into a proper recognition of the complexity and contradictions of the mind. It prepares us for the notion that if we are ever to make a good, shared life together with someone, we’ll have no option but to confront and accept – and in the end finally love – the infinitely strange and wondrous complexity of a fellow human.</p>
