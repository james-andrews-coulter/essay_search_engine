        <h3>5 Love</h3>
<p>We are Romantics; that is, we seek a soulmate, an exemplary friend who can at the same time be an intrepid sexual partner, a reliable co-parent and a kindly colleague. We are in revolt against coldness and emotional distance. We refuse to remain in unhappy unions that no longer possess the sense of connection of the early moments. We will move boulders to find a spiritual twin.</p>
<p>Gustave Caillebotte, Le Pont de l’Europe, 1876.</p>
