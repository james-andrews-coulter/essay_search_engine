        <h3>8. Too many friends</h3>
<p>One of the more unexpected reasons why a person may end up not having any friends is, paradoxically, because they have far too many already.</p>
<p>As friend-abundant people, we may seem like the last people to suffer from feelings of abandonment and forlornness. We might be invited out all the time; there may have been 23 people at our recent birthday party and there might be 123 of them attending our forthcoming wedding. Our phones might constantly buzz with new messages and we may not have been home for an evening on our own for two months. We don’t seem like candidates for loneliness. And yet, this is precisely what we could be, not because no one knows us but because everyone knows us. We have been surreptitiously driven to loneliness not by an absence of friends but by a crippling and ongoing plethora of them. We are lonely not because we are alone but because company has stripped us of opportunities for the sort of focused intimacy required to dissolve the more stubborn roots of isolation.</p>
<p>We have ended up in this confusing space in part because of an ambiguity in our societal understanding of what a ‘friend’ might be. At a popular level, the term seems to refer to someone we catch up with once or twice a year, whose job and relationship we vaguely understand, around whose arm we often place our own and whom we greet with great affection and a momentary longing for sincerity at large social gatherings where music makes it hard to speak.</p>
<p>But at another level, the word ‘friend’ also refers to someone who is never more than a phone call away, someone we spoke to this morning and whom we’ll be in touch with again at lunchtime and then once more again before evening, someone who understands us as well as a lover or a parent, someone whom we adore as much as a sibling, someone who would be there at our hospital bed at the end and for whom we would – in extremis – be ready to lay down our lives.</p>
<p>It’s a failure of language that both these sorts of people blithely carry the same title – but the confusion is more than linguistic. It causes us in practice to forget what we might best do with those we like.</p>
<p>We might assert – in sharp contradiction to the messages of society – that it is impossible to have many more than three proper friends. Four would be a maximum. At five, something has gone wrong. And by the time we invite over a hundred people to our wedding or can fill a restaurant for a birthday (even a landmark one), we have traduced the concept of friendship entirely.</p>
<p>Reasons that go beyond the financial or the physical explain why people tend not to have more than a few children. It appears impossible to maintain the sort of close emotional bonds that both parties crave once the numbers rise. We know that someone could not possibly be honouring the role of father or mother if they had obligations across twenty people. But a similar modesty escapes us when it comes to friendship, where we can imagine that it might be possible to be a friend worthy of the word to a group that could fill a tennis court.</p>
<p>In reality, proper friendships require time and close attention. We need to continually check in on those we profess to love; we have to keep their stories in mind; we need the emotional bandwidth to receive their sorrows and excitements and to maintain a sincerity born out of novelty in our disclosures and responses.</p>
<p>To have any friends, we may therefore need to do something that could sound odd and even rather mean (but isn’t either of these things): fire most of our existing friends. We may need to choose intensity over breadth. This hints at why many of us may find the move rather hard. True friendship requires commitment – which also necessarily entails emotional risk.</p>
<p>Once we start to love our friends, rather than merely consort with a stadium full of them, dangers start to mount. We might be abandoned; if a best friend stopped liking us, we might suffer an agony as great as any break-up. We rediscover in relation to true friendship some of the same attachment fears that bedevil us in love. But now at least we can know what is at play: we aren’t hanging out with a group because we are fulfilled, but because we are – at heart – terrified of the risks implied in more focused commitment.</p>
<p>We need to become specialists of friendship rather than its unwittingly isolated and forlorn generalists. People new to the idea of friendship may have a great many friends; those who have begun to understand what the institution can deliver have learnt to count them on a few fingers of one hand.</p>
