        <h2>Selective Procrastination</h2>
<p>No one can ever be efficient in every area of their life. A so-called ‘successful’ person isn’t someone accomplished in everything they are involved with; it’s someone who has focused their energies with unusual intensity on a particular set of questions.</p>
<p>In the life of every person who gets a lot done, there are, inevitably, a great many things they have avoided. There are many tasks that have been put aside, and many obligations that have been neglected. Achievement mostly depends on not doing a whole host of things that, in a broad and reasonable sense, one really ought to do. The efficient person may be considered deeply lazy in some areas of life; they have been an expert at winnowing their sense of responsibility; they are good at avoiding many details in order to concentrate on just one goal.</p>
<p>The efficient parent may have heavily neglected the upkeep of the house. The superb accountant may have been a disaster around keeping up with the latest highbrow films and novels. The devoted entrepreneur may have evaded many tricky conversations around their relationship.</p>
<p>A good life doesn’t require us to banish procrastination entirely; it involves making choices about where we will allow ourselves to remain inefficient, in the name of having a shot at excellence elsewhere.</p>
