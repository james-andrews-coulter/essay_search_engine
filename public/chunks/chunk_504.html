        <h3>¶ Kintsugi</h3>
<p>Kin = golden</p>
<p>tsugi = joinery</p>
<p>The origins of Kintsugi are said to date to the Muromachi period, when the Shogun of Japan, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), broke his favourite tea bowl. Distraught, he sent it to be repaired in China. On its return, he was horrified by the ugly metal staples that had been used to join the broken pieces, and charged his craftsmen with devising a more appropriate solution. What they came up with was a method that didn’t disguise the damage, but made something honestly artful out of it.</p>
<p>Kintsugi belongs to the Zen ideals of wabi-sabi, which cherishes what is simple, unpretentious and aged – especially if it has a rustic or weathered quality. A story is told of one of the great proponents of wabi-sabi, Sen no Riky (1522–1599). On a journey through southern Japan, he was invited to a dinner by a host who thought he would be impressed by an elaborate and expensive antique tea jar that he had bought from China. But Riky didn’t even seem to notice this item and instead spent his time chatting and admiring a branch swaying in the breeze outside. In despair at this lack of interest, once Riky had left, the devastated host smashed the jar to pieces and retired to his room. But the other guests more wisely gathered the fragments and stuck them together through kintsugi. When Riky next came to visit, the philosopher turned to the repaired jar and, with a knowing smile, exclaimed: ‘Now it is magnificent’.</p>

<p>The aesthetic of Kintsugi lends reverence to the damaged and imperfect – a principle we could usefully employ in our own lives.</p>
<p>In an age that worships youth, perfection and the new, the art of kintsugi retains a particular wisdom – as applicable to our own lives as to a broken teacup. The care and love expended on the shattered pots should lend us the confidence to respect what is damaged and scarred, vulnerable and imperfect – starting with ourselves and those around us.</p>
