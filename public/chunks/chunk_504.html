        <h2>Fear &amp; Procrastination</h2>
<p>We tend to account for why we procrastinate with a deeply convincing and hugely punitive explanation: we don’t get down to tasks because we are lazy. We don’t do what we should because we are, in essence, self-indulgent, slothful and (underneath it all) surely rather bad people.</p>
<p>The truth is more complicated, at once psychologically more nuanced and more worthy of sympathy. The real reason we are indolent is not so much because we are lazy as because we are scared. What we blithely call being lazy is really a symptom and consequence of anxiety.</p>
<p>Oddly, it tends to be very easy to get down to work on things that don’t matter very much. Their lack of importance encourages our lighter, more carefree and more productive sides. We find we’re done with them in no time and it doesn’t even feel like work; it’s closer to play.</p>
<p>Yet the stuff that really counts, that we need to complete because our lives may depend on it, terrifies us into inactivity. We are so scared of failure that we don’t dare to make a start. At least if we leave the task untouched, we won’t need to face any risk of humiliating incapacity or incompetence.</p>
<p>This analysis points to how we might increase our productivity. We would be advised not to remind ourselves (or get others to remind us) of how important a task may be: we know this full well already and that is precisely the problem.</p>
<p>What we need to do is to stress its relative unimportance in the grander scheme. So what if, in the end, we don’t get the job, or lose the contract, or are thought an idiot by people we care about? It happens, and it’s survivable. We mustn’t ramp up the pressure; we must strive to turn the task from a horrifying ordeal to the only thing we’ll know how to deal with calmly and energetically: a piece of play.</p>
<p>Lessening the imagined consequences of messing up liberates us to devote to a task all the energy and talent we actually possess.</p>
