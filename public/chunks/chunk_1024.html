        <h2>XVI: THE SULK ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>We’re coming back from a lunch with friends, but something is wrong. Our partner on whom we depend so much has managed to offend us during the meal. It was the way they told an anecdote about our new shorts and seemed to laugh at our expense. Not that we’re going to tell them. They’ve asked twice already if there is anything wrong, and we have firmly said, ‘Nothing at all, I’m fine.’</p>
<p>With other people, we’re always having to explain ourselves at length, and even when we do, they frequently struggle to grasp our drift – but a true lover seems to get us almost immediately, even in the finer-grained aspects of our personalities. No sooner have we tried to explain, for example, our feelings towards autumn evenings, or that bit in a song we like when the violins start to rise, than they generously step in to say, ‘I know, I know …’, seemingly ready to confirm our every sensation and idea.</p>
<p>This is a profoundly beautiful and exciting discovery, but it can give rise to hugely troubling dynamics in terms of the success of long-term relationships, for the view that a good lover must intuitively understand us is – over time – one of the most dangerous suppositions and is responsible for catastrophic outbreaks of sulking.</p>
<p>Sulking is a highly distinctive phenomenon within the psychology of arguments. Crucially, we don’t just sulk with anyone. We reserve our sulks for people we believe should understand us but happen on a given occasion not to. We could explain what is wrong, of course, but if we did so, it would mean that they had failed to understand us intuitively and, therefore, that they are not worthy of love. A sulk is one of the odder gifts of love.</p>
<p>Our incensed background belief that a good lover should just know explains why we sit quietly in the car all the way home, then disappear straight into the bathroom and bolt the door. When they ask again, ‘Please tell me what is wrong,’ we remain silent with our arms folded, for we implicitly believe that a true lover, someone really worthy of our affection, would naturally be able to read how and why we got offended, would gaze through the bathroom panel, through our bodies and into the caverns of our burnt and pained souls.</p>
<p>Sulking has its touching side, evoking the enormous faith that we place in our partner’s capacities to interpret us. But part of becoming an adult must be to believe that we cannot fairly continue to expect others to read our minds if we have not previously deigned to lay out their contents through the admittedly very cumbersome medium of words. Even the most intelligent, sensitive lover cannot be expected to continue to navigate around us without a lot of patiently articulated verbal indications of our desires and intentions.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t get furious when our lovers don’t guess right. Rather than bolting our mouths and retreating into the comforting silence of a sulk, we should have the courage – always – to try to explain.</p>
