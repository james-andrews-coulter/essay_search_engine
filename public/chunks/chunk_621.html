            <h3>¶ Loneliness</h3>
<p>Loneliness is the fundamental condition of humankind. This fact is heavily denied by Romantic culture, which promises us that there are in fact a few people who will be able to understand us fully – a fairy tale that causes us untold difficulty.</p>
<p>A high degree of loneliness is an inexorable part of being a sensitive, intelligent human. It is a built-in feature of a complex existence. We must all die alone, which really means that our pain is for us alone to endure. Others can throw us words of encouragement, but in every life we are out on the ocean drowning in the swell while others, even the nice ones, stand on the shore, waving good-naturedly.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that we will ever find someone on exactly the same page of the soul as us: we will long for utter congruity, but there will be constant dissonance because we appeared on the earth at different times, are the product of different experiences, and are not made of quite the same fabric.</p>
<p>The problem is sure to get worse the more thoughtful and perceptive we are. There will simply be fewer people like us around. Acute loneliness is a specially punitive tax we have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind.</p>
<p>At an exasperated moment, near the end of his life, the German writer Goethe, who appeared to have had a lot of friends, exploded bitterly: ‘No one has ever properly understood me, I have never fully understood anyone; and no one understands anyone else.’</p>
<p>It was a helpful outburst from a great man. It isn’t our fault: a degree of distance and mutual incomprehension is not a sign that life has gone wrong; it’s what we should expect from the very start. And when we do, benefits may flow. The history of art is the record of people who couldn’t find anyone in the vicinity to talk to. We can take up the coded offer of intimacy in the words of a Roman poet who died in 10 BCE or the lyrics of a singer who described just our blues in a recording from Nashville in 1963.</p>
<p>Loneliness makes us more capable of true intimacy if better opportunities ever come along. It heightens the conversations we have with ourselves; it gives us a character. We don’t repeat what everyone else thinks. We develop a point of view. We might be isolated for now, but we’ll be capable of far closer, more interesting bonds with anyone we do eventually locate.</p>
<p>Loneliness renders us elegant and strangely alluring. It suggests there is more about us to understand than the normal patterns of social intercourse can accommodate – which is something to take pride in. A sense of isolation truly is – as we suspect but usually prevent ourselves from feeling from fear of arrogance – a sign of depth. When we admit our loneliness, we are signing up to a club that includes the people we know from the paintings of Edward Hopper, the poems of Baudelaire and the songs of Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>Lonely, we enter a long and grand tradition; we find ourselves (surprisingly) in great company.</p>
