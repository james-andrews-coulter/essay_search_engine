        <h2>4. How to Collect a Home</h2>
<p>Take one room in your house – no more than one, or you’ll never finish this task!</p>
<p>First of all, make a list of every object in that room: every chair and table, every knick-knack, every drawing pin. Second, count them up. Third, try to classify them – the categories you
  use are entirely up to you: indeed, it is important to this task that you make them up yourself. Fourth, once you have classified all these objects, remove them from the list until you just have
  the categories you divided them into, on their own.</p>
<p>Were you surprised by the variety and number of objects a room can contain? How did you set about classifying them? When you look at the categories you created, which proved useful, and which
  didn’t? Did anything surprise you?</p>
