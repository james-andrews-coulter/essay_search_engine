        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ideally, we would never have to leave the house, or even our bed. It would all be to hand—everything one desired, needed and hoped for would be within immediate reach, as it might have been when one was very small and at peace in a comforting cradle.</p>
<p>But as we mature, our needs invariably develop in more complicated ways and so the ability of a single environment to meet them must falter. We start to dream of ‘elsewhere’; we want to go places; we crave a change of scene.</p>
<p>We’ve been doing this for a long time. The ancient Greeks were among the first to know about therapeutic places—the word stems from their term <em>therapeutikos</em>, meaning curative, helpful, healing—and they constantly took to the road in the hope of finding relief: they went to the Sanctuary of Asclepius in Epidaurus to beg for help for piles and cancer, wind and earache; they went to the Oracle at Delphi in search of wisdom and advice on marriage and career; they went to the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion to derive courage and counsel on seafaring; and in addition had a hundred or so major shrines around the Greek world to choose from to address problems ranging from impotence and infertility to depression and insomnia.</p>
<p>Our species has continued to look out for therapeutic places to travel to. In the 1840s, the German doctor Hermann Brehmer discovered that patients with tuberculosis might be helped by spending many months at high altitude, largely lying horizontally on an outdoor terrace facing the sun. And so, for over a century, until the discovery of streptomycin, the Alps were dotted with imposing sanatoria with large glazed balconies overlooking pastures ringing with the sound of cow-bells and dedicated to the management and eradication of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.</p>
<p>Other places have been recommended to treat ailments of a more diffuse psychological nature. Eighteenth-century doctors prescribed that the bereaved should visit Karlsbad in Bohemia (present-day Karlovy Vary) to drink at least ten glasses of water a day from the springs; the mineral-rich waters at Baden-Baden were reputed to have the power to console the childless and those abandoned in love.</p>
<p>We don’t need to be convinced believers in religion or adherents of the woolier ends of medical treatment to recognise the overall point: that there are places that can help, parts of the world that can assist us with our troubles in a way that our own homes cannot. This book is a compendium of therapeutic places that may offer us a holiday or respite from certain difficulties of our psyches; places that can help us to reframe our difficulties, shed new light on our mental blocks, lift our moods and restore us to a measure of calm and purpose.</p>
<p>We are all patients in various states of distress, some of us hobbling, the rest of us bravely keeping up appearances. Every worthwhile location is—in a sense—a sanatorium to which we should repair for moments of rest and inspiration; a place where we might stop for a while, in our imaginations or in reality, in order to rebuild our strength and identify a few new reasons to live.</p>
