            <h4>2. Attunement to Nature</h4>
<p>I love this word ‘attunement’ to describe a widely shared sense that there is something crucial about solitude in relation to an engagement with nature. It is not
  my word, but Philip Koch’s, in his book Solitude, where he explores this attunement and breaks it down into three different components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clear, undistracted, sensitized perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic perception: perceiving nature as signifying or symbolizing other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fusion/interfusion: the loss of the sense of barriers between oneself and nature, the sense of flowing out into it as it simultaneously flows through oneself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I wrote A Book of Silence I came up with an almost identical list, except that I saw them as effects of silence rather than solitude. But I have come to think
  that Koch may be right; nature is seldom, if ever, really silent.</p>
<p>The first of Koch’s list is, in a sense, fairly obvious. Nature is reclusive or ‘shy’; if you want to see, you have to pay careful attention and you have to go quietly –
  and both these things are much easier to do alone. I have found that even having a dog as a companion means that I see less – the birds fly away and my attention is less focused. You are more
  likely to perceive clearly if you are undistracted. Being alone is known to intensify all physical sensation. But there is something more to it. A great many people find they agree with Henry
  Thoreau that ‘it appears to be a law that you cannot have a deep sympathy with both man and nature. Those qualities that bring you near to the one estrange you from the other . . . The mind
  that perceives clearly any natural beauty is in that instant withdrawn from human society.’</p>
<p>The business of finding meaning, or metaphor and symbol, in nature seems an almost atavistic reaction. The gods of our ancestors were, on the whole, gods of the wild places; very small children
  can be entertained for hours finding images in the shapes of clouds, and the poet Wordsworth writes tragically of his character Peter Bell:</p>
<p>A primrose by a river’s brim</p>
<p>A yellow primrose was to him,</p>
<p>And it was nothing more.</p>
<p>It is less immediately clear why being alone so powerfully enhances this capacity – perhaps because there is no one to express a different symbolism, to challenge your
  meanings with theirs, so that the effect of your meaning can sink deeper into the mind.</p>
<p>The experience of fusion with, or into, nature is, when it happens, one of the highest joys of solitude. In A Book of Silence I describe one such episode on the Isle of Skye:</p>
<p>I climbed up the steep-sided corrie. It was sheltered there and magnificent – almost vertical mountains on both sides – a mixture of shining rock and loose scree,
    and below, tiny stands of water that looked like handfuls of shiny coins tossed casually down. It was so huge. And so wild and so empty and so free . . . And then quite suddenly and unexpectedly,
    I slipped a gear or something like that. There was not me and the landscape, but a kind of oneness: a connection as though my skin had been blown off. More than that – as though the
    molecules and atoms I am made of reunited themselves with the molecules and atoms that the rest of the world is made of. I felt absolutely connected to everything. It was very brief but it was a
    total moment.</p>
<p>Over and over again individuals report these extraordinary, mystical experiences when they are alone in nature. It never seems to happen if you are with anyone else, perhaps
  because we all have a deep inhibition against exposing ourselves so nakedly to another, even a beloved other.</p>
