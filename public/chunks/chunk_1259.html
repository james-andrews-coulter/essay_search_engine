        <h2>Places of Memory</h2>
<p>Benicadell is the name of a mountain in Spain on the border between Valencia and Alicante, which the English artist Hamish Fulton climbed in February 2016. We know about this principally because Fulton made an enormous work of art, almost 2 metres wide by 1 metre high, to commemorate the ascent. In the course of a long career, Fulton travelled to fifty different corners of the world to walk around, and subsequently made large photographs that record through sober, haunting blackand-white images overlaid with blocks of formal text exactly where he went, how long it took him and (often) what was the highest point he reached. In April 2011, he went on a clockwise walk around London’s M25 motorway (crossing the River Thames at Kingston); in November the following year, he walked up the (4,971-metrehigh) Cerro Jorquencal in Chile and, at the start of his career, in 1977, he took five days to make a hundred-mile circuit around the Outer Hebrides, terminating in the Neolithic stone circle at Callanish.
Why endow such relatively ordinary events with such momentousness? Why assume such a grave tone when climbing a mountain or going around a ring road? We tend to be a lot more restrained about our peregrinations. We may invest heavily in our travels, but once they are over, we put them quietly to one side; we might at the most dedicate a few pages in a photo album or use a postcard of the seafront as a bookmark. But we are rarely tempted to create something the size of the living room wall to tell the world that we once went to Prague for a long weekend or took a canal holiday in southwestern France for our 40th.
Hamish Fulton would disagree with our modesty within which he might also detect a note of complacency. For Fulton, we are in no danger of making too much of our travels; the risk lies in how many experiences we let
wash over us, and how often we fail to make any attempt to pin them down in memory or give them substantial weight in the story of our lives. We climb mountains, cross oceans, touch glaciers and can barely remember doing so only shortly afterwards. Fulton proposes that a trip might be one of the most significant events we ever experience, and that there should be no limit to what it means to us, even if it happened to last only a few days. He implicitly argues that we are not pretentious enough, not grand enough. In the 14th century, it was not uncommon to find on a northern European gravestone an inscription commemorating that the deceased had ‘travelled to the Holy Land’, signalling in no uncertain terms that the most astonishing thing about someone might be that they had made a trip to Israel. It is unthinkable that we would ever accord such honour to a trip today, outside perhaps of a visit to Mars.
Yet our trips may still deserve to be counted among the signal events of our biographies. Many of them are accompanied by important changes in our thoughts. They have a theoretical power to reorient us profoundly. We might decide sitting on the beach near Le Havre on a rainy August day that we have no option but to leave a relationship; it could be during a three-day visit to Switzerland that we concretise a wish to start a new career. At 3.40 p.m. on a November afternoon on a trip to Tenerife, watching our 2-year-old son sleeping in the main square of the little town of Garachico, we might begin to understand love.
The ease with which we can travel has not necessarily served us well. We might not follow Fulton in his art, but we might adopt some of his spirit in associating our journeys more firmly with evolutions in our psyches. The point is never just to travel; it’s to be able to
return as, and remain, slightly different people.</p>
