        <h3>¶ Transference</h3>
<p>Transference is a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature – that we cobbled together in childhood to meet a threat that we were at that time too vulnerable, immature and inexperienced to cope with properly. We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to what feels like a very familiar threat.</p>
<p>In most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy, and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is distantly evocative of our earlier troubles.</p>
<p>The unconscious mind is slow to realise that things have changed in the outer world and is quick to mistake one person for another, twenty years ago for now, seeming to judge only by the crudest of correspondences.</p>
<p>Transference generally happens without us knowing it. We think we are responding to the present while in fact being guided by a pattern from the past. We carry years behind us that we have forgotten about and that we aren’t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We can easily just come across as mean or mad.</p>
<p>The concept of transference provides a vantage point on some of the most frustrating behaviours that any of us ever generate. It allows us to feel sympathy for other people where we might have felt only irritation. A wiser culture would teach us that transference is normal. Recognising that one is doing it oneself is not an admission of unusual idiocy; it’s an instance of mature self-knowledge.</p>
