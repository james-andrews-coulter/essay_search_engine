            <h1>2. The Thirty-Minute Exercise26</h1>
<ul>
<li>Commit to doing this exercise and allotting the full thirty minutes to it.</li>
<li>Get yourself a notebook and something to write with.</li>
<li>Turn off the phone, computer, radio and television. Resolve not to pick up a book or a newspaper, and choose a time when you will not be disturbed.</li>
<li>Get yourself a clock or stopwatch and set it for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Sit with your back supported. You can put your feet up but do not lie down, as you may go to sleep, which is not the purpose of this exercise.</li>
<li>Focus your attention on your breathing and empty your mind of other thoughts.</li>
<li>Thoughts will come into your head but do not stay with any one thought. Label it and write it on your pad with one or two words, then let it go. When the next thought comes into your mind, do the same thing. If the urge to stop the exercise comes into your mind, treat that like any other thought, jot it down and focus your attention back on your breathing.</li>
<li>
<p>Do this for thirty minutes.
Now look at all the thoughts you have written down, sort them into one of the following categories and then total the thoughts in each category. The numbers at the end of each category are my own results for this exercise:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensory-awareness thoughts: e.g. sounds, sights smells sensations – 4</p>
</li>
<li>Planning thoughts: to-do lists of wants or needs – 3</li>
<li>Anxiety-provoking thoughts: worries or self-deprecating thoughts – 2</li>
<li>Playing back of memories – 0</li>
<li>Fantasies about non-existent situations, relationships or events – 0</li>
<li>Envious, angry, rebellious, critical thoughts: wanting to stop the exercise or critical thoughts about others – 5</li>
<li>Take-over: any thoughts you were unable to clear and that took over the exercise? – 0
You can add more categories to suit the types of thoughts you have.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the exercise is first to see what happens for you; for you to notice how you experience the exercise. You are probably pretty good at noticing the words you use as you talk to yourself, but it is interesting to listen to those thoughts that do not have words.</p>
<p>Secondly, this thirty-minute sample of your thoughts might be an indication of the percentage of your daily thoughts in the various different areas; so, for example, if you spend 80 per cent of your thinking life in fantasy and 20 per cent feeling critical, you can look at that and think: ‘I have a choice. I may want to experiment. Perhaps it would be more satisfying to allot more of my thinking time to noticing what I can see or smell or if I focused instead on what I appreciate?’ The point of the exercise is to become more self-aware. You cannot change anything unless you know what it is you are changing. The only way you can get this exercise wrong is to not do it, or abandon it early. But even then you can start again.</p>
<p>This is an extract of the summary I made and the conclusions I came to when I had finished the exercise:</p>
<p>I do not know which category to put my fleeting thought about appreciating marmalade in; maybe it should have gone in memory rather than sensory awareness. Anyway, don’t suppose that matters. I notice I’ve written ‘too fat’ down; can’t remember having that thought, but I’m guessing I was thinking about myself – that definitely goes in ‘Anxiety-provoking’. I had quite a lot of resistance to doing the exercise – five protests, I notice on the pad. The other thing I noticed is that all the protests happened in the first ten minutes and that the first half seemed to go slowly; then I surrendered to the exercise and the second half almost went too fast, and I was sorry when it was over. After I had finished resisting it, it felt as if I was keeping myself company and that was a good feeling. I wonder if that was because I was then open to what popped into my head? I’m not sure what that resistance is about but it felt very familiar. Next time I feel that resistance I will be curious as to what it is about; whether it is a matter of long-term gain or short-term gain. In this instance I feel satisfied that I listened to it but put it on one side. Had I acted on it, it could be seen to be self-sabotaging. I do find it incredible how a simple exercise like this really does feel like I paid myself some positive attention and gained from it. I’m not sure whether the meanings I have extracted are anything more than post-rationalization, but appreciating that can be satisfying too.</p>
<p>This exercise gives us information about ourselves that we may not otherwise have appreciated. When we do the exercise once a week and compare the results, we can monitor changes in our thinking patterns. It also lets us get a feel for which thoughts foster our creativity and curiosity and may lead to growth, and those that, by contrast, lead us down the dead-end of post-rationalization.</p>
