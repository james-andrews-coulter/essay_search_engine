            <h3>The hardest person in theworld to break up with</h3>
<p>Break-ups are almost invariably difficult, but there may be different degrees of complexity at stake in different situations. There exists a cataclysmically painful but little-known type who we might describe as the hardest person in the world to break up with.</p>
<p>A relationship with this type begins like this: you are very drawn to them. Perhaps you are attracted to them physically, and their personality is compelling as well. You admire them and, in areas, feel sympathy for them too; there is probably something in their past that really interests and touches you. You have no desire to break up; in fact, you’d love this to last till the end.</p>
<p>For their part, they seem to be keen on you. They show no interest in leaving you. They want this to be for the long term; perhaps forever.</p>
<p>There is a problem, however, so grave yet so hidden, so damaging yet so hard to grasp, that you can only face up to it slowly. You realise that the partner whom you love and who says they love you is having a grievously detrimental effect on your mental or physical well-being.</p>
<p>What wrong might the partner be perpetrating? It is a spectrum. At one extreme, they might be physically abusive. But the spectrum is long and contains all sorts of insidious ways in which, without ever raising a hand, one human can badly damage another. They might be having affairs, or spending too much money. They might be addicted to something. Or – and this can be hard to get a grip on – they may be constantly ‘absent’. They show no reliable warmth towards you; they never initiate any touch; they may never hug. They are present but not really there.</p>
<p>Probably, as soon as these problems first arose, you started to complain. But you did so softly, or sarcastically, or bitterly. Not head-on. After all, you love them and you’re a good boy or girl. It can take a long time – years, decades – before you find your voice and feel able to raise an adult objection. What then happens when you ask these types to face up to the harm they are doing to you? There are two main responses.</p>
