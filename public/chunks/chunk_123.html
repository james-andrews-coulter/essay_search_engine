            <h3>¶ Popularity</h3>
<p>Intellectuals have often been very troubled by the idea of popularity; it seems a deeply wrong guide to what is good, important and serious. They look at some of the most conspicuously popular things (certain newspapers or television shows, for example) and see how shallow and misleading they are. From these examples, it’s tempting to draw the conclusion that popularity in itself must be a wicked element.</p>
<p>Yet in a democracy, it’s hugely important what happens to be popular. However beautiful and true an idea may be, if it isn’t popular, it won’t be of any consequence. Instead of condemning popularity, serious people should seek it.</p>
<p>The most successful items of popular culture make certain distinctive moves. They contain clues about how things and ideas get to be popular: they are funny; they intensify drama; they move fast; they are carnal; they never condemn their audiences; they speak from the heart; they are strongly emotional; they acknowledge our fantasies and our darker thoughts; they are direct; they are immensely charming. They are hugely aware of how easily attention is lost, so they seek to entice at every moment.</p>
<p>The currently unpopular, intellectual culture that is ambitious around serious issues faces two choices. Either it can continue to be unpopular, and therefore have very limited consequence in the world, or it can seek to learn the lessons of popularity. It can attempt to make its way into the inner lives of the widest, largest section of the population.</p>
<p>Tragically, our sophisticated culture has, in the main, repudiated all the moves that are essential to popularity. But the moves themselves do not corrupt. A truth doesn’t become a falsehood for being presented in a sexier or more amusing way. The idea and the vehicle are distinct. Wisdom doesn’t become stupidity because a lot of people embrace it. Rather than condemn popular culture, the high-minded should deftly attempt to steal its box of tricks.</p>
