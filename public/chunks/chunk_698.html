        <h3>¶ Utopia</h3>
<p>A Utopia is a picture of how things should be, as opposed to how they actually are. Utopian thinking involves wondering about a future altered for the better in a variety of ways. What if technology overcame the energy crisis? What if everyone were rich? What if we could fly in seconds to other planets?</p>
<p>A lot of utopian thinking currently focuses on technology and its power to overcome material and practical challenges. Yet some of the truly exciting developments we can ponder concern how we might alter the emotional sides of our lives.</p>
<p>We should allow ourselves to imagine a variety of ways in which our world could be transformed if our emotional needs were more clearly understood and given pride of place, if society were explicitly organised around the goal of eudaimonia and was dedicated to furnishing us with the psychological skills required for a flourishing life.</p>
<p>How might we reorganise marriage? How could schools be redesigned? How might working environments be reformed? What would the media be like? How would anger be dealt with? How might we rethink old age and death?</p>
<p>We may be tempted to dismiss emotional utopian thinking as ridiculously disconnected from the real world and therefore a waste of time. But Utopias are better understood as thought experiments in which we try to define important goals without having to bother with many of the practical issues that will one day have to be sorted out. We need our imaginations to go ahead and define a destination in order to know where we will have to direct our slow-moving packhorses and mules.</p>
<p>To the utopian thinker, the fact that we don’t quite know every detail about how to carry out an important project doesn’t constitute a decisive objection against it. A Utopia is what sets our course and defines our ambitions.</p>
