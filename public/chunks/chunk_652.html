        <h3>¶ Polyamory</h3>
<p>Polyamory is the belief in the possibility and nobility of loving (and sleeping with) more than one person at a time, in a situation of mutual consent.</p>
<p>Polyamory can appear a highly mature and workable solution to the tensions between love and sex. It promises that one may not have to choose between a satisfying sex life on the one hand, and a satisfying love life on the other. The two may be combined, by sleeping with and loving a succession of different people. Furthermore, there need be no reason for secrets. Everything one wants can be shared and combined.</p>
<p>Sadly, this promising philosophy has a tendency to forget certain deeply embedded and unfortunate facts about human nature. It overlooks how nice it is when something is fully ours and how worrying it can be when we can no longer make a powerful claim on a person we have learnt to trust. It ignores the pain of not being the centre of another’s emotional life. It makes light of jealousy and turns possessiveness into a pathology, rather than an awful but stubborn fact.</p>
<p>The problem with polyamory is not the future it beckons us to. It is what it forgets, along the way, about human beings.</p>
