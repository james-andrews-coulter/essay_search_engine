        <h3>One of us has been unfaithful</h3>
<p>The words ‘unfaithful’ and ‘betrayal’ carry such negative weight that anyone who has ever been their victim is advised at once to leave, to preserve their dignity and to honour modern values.</p>
<p>Infidelity, however, covers a wide range of very different scenarios, and what a sexual act outside a relationship actually truly means depends on a specific emotional context we would be wise to explore before calling time on any couple.</p>
<p>One tricky possibility is that the unfaithful one was not primarily interested in sex at all; what they really wanted was to be liked, talked and listened to – their need was primarily emotional. This does not mean that all in the couple is well, it just places a different spin on where the problem lies and what the possible solution to it might be. It won’t be sterilisation or a prison that is called for, but – maybe – a chance to explore why channels of feeling have become blocked. Though it is the sex component that, once an affair is revealed, typically gets all the outraged attention, the straying lover might have been using sex to communicate – badly but genuinely – a more poignant truth: that they felt abandoned. They were attempting – in a mangled and misguided way – to make a plea to their partner for love.</p>
<p>In other words, a ‘betrayal’ isn’t always and necessarily a rejection of an existing relationship; it can on occasion represent an incompetent but real attempt to repair it. The ideal response to such a discovery wouldn’t be to declare the relationship over, but to try to work out why what happened happened and how the wound could appropriately be tended to.</p>
<p>This is not a strayer’s charter, just a reminder that there is space for a form of understanding that can turn an act of infidelity (massively unwelcome and hurtful though it might be) from an outrage and a monstrosity into something we can at least understand, unpick and perhaps even survive.</p>
