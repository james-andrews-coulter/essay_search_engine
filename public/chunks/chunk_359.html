        <h3>Animals</h3>
<p>After failure, we should pay a great deal of attention to animals – especially ducks, sheep, cows and squirrels – chiefly because they pay so little attention to us. Even if they are living in close proximity to us, even if they depend on us for their food supplies, most animals are thoroughly uninterested in everything connected with us. They may come over and nibble at some lettuce or take some nuts from our hand, but they have no thought of looking into our eyes. They would as gladly take nourishment from a convicted felon as they would from a prince or a reigning pop star. The sheep chewing lazily by an oak tree have no interest in the latest dramas in our lives, in the slights we have received, in the hopes we have for rehabilitation or in our shame at our misdeeds. We are as featureless and uninteresting to them as a cloud or an escarpment.</p>
<p>This makes animals ideal companions. They show no proclivity to judge and they don’t moralise. They generally don’t talk. They offer us their presence, but they don’t intrude with their thoughts. They won’t suggest that they could have done any better in our shoes and they won’t be sentimental or passive-aggressive in their words of comfort. They will simply sit beside us for a while, breathing heavily, occasionally burping or farting. And then they will bid us goodbye – perhaps returning to say a downbeat hello the next day.</p>
<p>We may have failed in the world of men; we still have so many interesting afternoons to spend in the company of animals.</p>
