        <h3>¶ Shyness</h3>
<p>Shyness is a consequence of a paralysing and yet always mistaken impression of the difference between ourselves and other people. In the kindest way, it is a symptom of the provincialism of our minds.</p>
<p>At shy moments, we are overwhelmed by a sense of the otherness of others. They are all women, and we are a man. They are rich and we are poor. They are from the north, and we’re from the south. The obstacles appear insurmountable.</p>
<p>The way past them is to recall that each of us has both a local and a universal identity. The local identity comprises age, gender, skin colour, sexuality, social background, career and religion. But this is not the limit of who we are. Within our universal identity is the fact that we all have problematic families, have all been disappointed, have all been idiotic, have all been loved, have all been hated, have all had problems around sex, have all had anxieties – and will all bleed if we are pricked. The last point alludes to Shylock’s haunting plea in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice:</p>
<p>I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?</p>
<p>Shylock’s words are relevant not only to a prejudiced audience. They are of huge potential benefit to the shy as well. However unbelievable it may seem at nervous moments, we invariably have much in common with any member of our species. It is no coincidence that Shakespeare had read and absorbed the writings of the Roman playwright Terence, who is remembered for his declaration: Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (‘I am human, nothing human is foreign to me’).</p>
<p>At times when we cannot help but doubt this concept, when we can readily see no echo of any of our concerns in the faces of others, we must make a social leap of faith:</p>
<p>Even though the person I see in front of me seems alien in a hundred ways, even though I can currently notice no points of similarity, this cannot be true. There will, and has to be, a shared universal humanity, which it is within my powers to discover.</p>
