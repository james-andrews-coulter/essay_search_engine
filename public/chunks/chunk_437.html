            <h3>Cosmology</h3>
<p>It can be rather dispiriting to digest the fact that our sun, which we naturally take to be a big deal, is in fact only one of 100 billion suns in our galaxy, which in turn lies in a modest corner of a universe made up of a trillion galaxies in which there might be 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (or a quadrillion) stars in total. It can be equally terrifying to know that these stars are constantly running out of energy, and that while a few are being born, many are very slowly fading, with our own sun destined to burn out in 7–8 billion years – at which point the Earth, with all its restaurants, headlines, skyscrapers, melodramas, teddy bears, love affairs and tears, will be absorbed back into primal nothingness, and it will be as though nothing had ever disturbed the static silence and darkness of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Once we have failed, though, these thoughts – and other examples of the true scale of time and space – emerge as an unexpected source of supreme therapeutic solace. If our ultimate collective destiny is to be burnt up in a gigantic hydrogen and helium explosion, it may matter slightly less that our reputation is in tatters and that we are being investigated by the authorities. From the vantage point of Icarus, the furthest star ever recorded – more than 9 billion light years from Earth in the region of the supernova Refsdal – very little of what agitates us has any meaning at all. The differences between individual humans fade almost entirely: it hardly matters that we have been sacked while others continue their ascent, that our children are not currently speaking to us, that we have been described as a reprobate and an embarrassment and that we have had to move house in order to escape the hostile stares of neighbours. From the far corners of the universe, one can no longer tell quite who is the fool and who the success story, who is the winner and who deserves to be spat at. Across the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe, our own allotted microsecond of life is as nothing. It doesn’t – from the perspective of J0313-1806, the most distant known quasar that holds the furthest supermassive black hole – really matter so much that we are pitiful wretches, unlikely ever to be granted a second chance. Infinite space takes us in its arms and dissolves us into redemptive nonexistence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are never too far from such calming thoughts. Every night, so long as the sky is clear, we have one of the finest philosophical lessons ever generated written above us in a faint script of light.</p>
