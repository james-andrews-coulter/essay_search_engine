            <h2>8.  Work</h2>
<p>It is perhaps one of the big changes of the twentieth century that in our contemporary Western societies we no longer have a division between leisured and labouring classes. The great majority of us work. More than that, we largely derive our sense of value and self-worth from work. Even English aristocrats residing in their country seats (however dilapidated these may be) want to be usefully occupied. To be a modern person is to be a worker, whether you are man or woman, driven by necessity or by preference.</p>
<p>At the same time, our attitudes to work are often ambivalent. Centuries of experience have told us that work is a matter of necessity, something that is imposed on us; a yoke that has to be accepted, but ought to be resisted. And indeed, work is the area of life which most palpably brings us up against the limits of free choice. We can’t always get what we want in the world of jobs, although hopefully we can get at least what we need. Being part of the world of work requires us to accept the limits of our freedom and our egotism.</p>
<p>In the right conditions, however, work is the area of life that most clearly calls for and meets the criteria for full engagement. For most of us, work is a central source of significance and of purpose. At the day-to-day level, it affords us the energizing pleasures of delimited tasks whose goals are well defined, and, in the best-case scenario, both challenging and achievable.</p>
<p>How, then, can we become fully engaged in work, even in imperfect circumstances? I am not going to talk here about conditions which are unacceptable – wrongful dismissal, unjustified inequality of pay, and other social problems which the world of work, more than any other area of life, produces in every society. These are beyond the purview of this book; here, I am concerned with how we might derive from our work all the satisfaction and stimulation it can offer.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the first steps is to banish what might be called excess ambivalence – a subliminal sense that, really, we’re not supposed to enjoy work too much, as a matter of principle, or a kind of cultural resistance. In taking on almost any kind of job, we need to bring our full awareness to our decision: to understand what benefits of exploration or meaningful activity a particular occupation can offer us, even if it is not our ideal choice, and what we can bring to it in return. It is also useful to keep in mind that in our current work structures, while we rarely have guarantees of permanence, we don’t have to think of any job we take on as interminable. The older system of lifelong loyalty to an institution had the advantages of security, but it also had the considerable drawbacks of stasis and stifling boredom. The ‘man in the grey flannel suit’ who year after year sat at the same desk in the same office, going through sheaves of dusty documents, hardly exists any more; for one thing, the dusty documents have been replaced by those clean (if sometimes too addictively compelling) computer files.</p>
<p>The conditions of work in our society have in many ways improved from the days of the assembly line or deadly office routine. In fact, for many of us, the great secret is that we like to work. That is what sociologists are discovering, as they study our work habits in detail. For example, when employees of a big American company were given options to work part-time, or to take time off, many of them did not accept the offer. This was not mainly for financial reasons, but because many employees – although they were reluctant to admit it – found domestic life more stressful and more difficult than their jobs. Such findings are echoed elsewhere. They reflect the fact that time at home, especially for people with families, is fragmented among so many activities: taking children to their various engagements, dealing with accumulated emails, making supper, making sure the kids aren’t watching pornography online, etc. This can create stressful pressures and scattering of attention, and exhausting demands to keep making small and bigger choices. A friend who has growing children and a large circle of friends remarked that work is the most restful thing she can do; finally, she can be in one place at one time, and bring her mind to a concentrated task.</p>
<p>Purposeful concentration is one of the conditions of flow, but in order to achieve it we need to give our assent to the job we are doing, even if we are conscious of its limitations. It helps, also, to know ourselves well enough that we do not overestimate – or underestimate – our abilities.</p>
<p>But if we plunge into a job willingly, and give ourselves over to its demands (without succumbing to those ever-present digital distractions), then we can derive great satisfaction from the structured effort that most work involves: from performing a task to its completion, without the nagging sense that we might be – or maybe should be – doing a dozen other things. Whether we are trying to make something or to solve more abstract problems, work presents us with tasks which are by definition useful, and whose aims are delimited and defined. It allows us the luxury of focused attention as we grapple with a problem or process. In that sense, work is an antidote to mental dispersion and fragmentation; and in presenting us with new challenges, many jobs can stretch us to exercise our mental capacities strenuously, and discover in ourselves innovative ways of thinking, or abilities we didn’t quite know we had.</p>
<p>A sense of competence and accomplishment, as well as the adventurousness of tackling new problems, is one of the energizing pleasures that work can offer us. The other is collaboration. Most of us still work in institutions rather than at home, and most jobs require at least occasional collaboration with colleagues, and collective decisions. (Even if we work from home, our activities are addressed to others, and often need their input and contributions.) But there are also forms of endeavour in which collaboration is an intrinsic part of the work process. As anyone who has worked at an architectural office, say, or a newspaper knows, putting together a complicated product or project – one which calls for disparate skills and parts – requires a constant and precise level of cooperation. In order for a newspaper (an institution where my main experience of collaborative work comes from) to appear each day, the writer has to deliver the piece, the editor to make sure the piece meets certain standards, the printer to put through each page in time, and hopefully without too many errors. In order for this to happen, each person involved has to contribute their part on time and without demanding special attention or considerations – at least while the task is being completed. Tempers occasionally flare up, and disagreements break out; but everyone understands that these cannot go on for long – that the job has to get done, and for the moment, personal concerns have to be put aside.</p>
<p>The pleasure we take in such collaboration can be great. It is the enjoyment of solidarity – of working with others towards a particular goal, and achieving something we all value. The relationships involved are not necessarily personal; indeed, they require us to put aside, for the duration of the task, the preferences we may feel for particular colleagues, or our antagonisms. But the solidarity we feel with others is in itself what might be called an impersonal emotion – a sense of invigorating satisfaction that comes from participating with others in a collective effort, and from knowing that we can count on each other to contribute our part. This implies a kind of impersonal trust in others, as well as in ourselves. We cannot collaborate effectively if we are feeling excessively insecure, or superior to our colleagues.</p>
<p>Even in less collaborative jobs, if we work in the spirit of pure competition, or if we are perennially resentful because we feel we are underestimated, that may prevent us from being absorbed in the content of what we are doing – and therefore, from enjoying our jobs and doing them well. The instinct for cooperation runs deep, and is built into our evolutionary history. Certainly, animal groups have to achieve a certain degree of cooperation in order to survive; and we humans could not have built our cultures and civilizations through solitary endeavour. At the same time, in our highly competitive and stress-inducing societies, the collaborative impulse is easily undermined. In order to reclaim its pleasures we also need sometimes to step back from the fray, and reckon with internal attitudes. Work requires not only specific skills but emotional self-awareness; and time spent in self-reflection is well repaid in work satisfaction, and perhaps even success.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I have been talking mostly about middle-class jobs. It is undoubtedly much harder to achieve satisfaction if you work in a factory which produces, say, computer chips in an assembly-line process. Even in such places, though, physical environments are no longer as infernal as they once were, and employees may experience the enjoyment of a task well done as well as the pleasures of sociability and solidarity. In Flow, Csikszentmihalyi describes Joe, who worked all his life as a welder in a Chicago plant where railroad cars were assembled. Joe enjoyed mastering various aspects of the plant’s operations so much that he refused to become foreman, a promotion that would have deprived him of physical involvement in his work.</p>
<p>It is possible that states of flow are easier to attain in work that draws on physical skills as well as mental ones, and therefore helps us achieve a kind of mind–body integration. Indeed, it should be no surprise to find that many varieties of work not classified as ‘white-collar’ can be a source of pleasure and satisfaction. Farming can surely be seen as a ‘holistic’ activity (just think of The Archers), no matter what its physical or, sometimes, economic hardships. Certainly, traditional farmers in parts of the world which have not been subject to full modernization often express a deep attachment to their way of life. In more modernized circumstances, devising or constructing better machine parts, say, can be a high form of craft. Such jobs should, and probably will, become more respected as our physical skills threaten to decline – not least because of our ever-increasing reliance on the internet – and as we begin to admire them, sometimes with nostalgia.</p>
<p>Work, above all activities, engages what are sometimes called ‘social emotions’ – our need for respect and recognition, but also for cooperation and extending respect to others. Such needs are central to our sense of self, and apparently proceed from regions of our brains involved in the most fundamental emotions. The neurological signals of admiration are as powerful as those involved in the feelings of love. Whatever society we live in, we want to be esteemed by our colleagues and fellow workers – indeed, by our fellow humans. But in order to be able to experience esteem – to recognize the recognition, so to speak – and in order to extend it to others, we need to achieve a kind of internal balance in which we are neither too insecure nor too egotistical to see others as our colleagues and equals.</p>
<p>Purposeful activity and collaboration are the invigorating pleasures of work; but perhaps the main good and psychic benefit we derive from it – so obvious as to go too easily unnoticed – is a sense of usefulness. The need to feel useful runs deep in us, and is closely aligned with our need for a sense of purpose. We are social animals, and in order to feel that we matter, we need to be needed as well as esteemed or loved. To be affirmed as part of any group or community, we want to feel valued for our contribution to it. Of course, we baulk at being considered merely useful or instrumental, but work is an area of life in which we can temporarily subsume our particular personalities in the service of the impersonal needs of a group or a common aim – and (perhaps by a dynamic analogy with contemplative concentration) feel ourselves to be not diminished but enlarged thereby.</p>
