        <h4>4. Look at Nature</h4>
<p>By ‘look at nature’ I do not mean ‘get out into nature’ – although, as I have already suggested, this is a very good thing to do when you are
  alone. As I have described, one of the arguments deployed against those who want to be alone is that such a desire is ‘unnatural’.</p>
<p>This is a complicated sort of accusation, made up of so many strands that it is quite difficult to unravel and examine it, and indeed it has built itself so deeply into our culture and ways of
  thought that we seldom even try to unravel and examine it. The word ‘natural’ has aggregated a confusingly wide range of meanings, some of which are in contradiction to each other. For
  example, the Oxford English Dictionary, along with sixteen other separate meanings for ‘natural’ as an adjective, defines it both as something ‘based upon the innate
  moral feeling of mankind; instinctively felt to be right and fair’ and as something ‘in a state of primitive development, not spiritually enlightened. Unenlightened,
  unregenerate.’</p>
<p>Interestingly, until very recently one thing that ‘natural’ did not mean was ‘things like animals, trees, mountains and oceans’, although this is often the implication
  when people call something ‘unnatural’. We need to be alert to the implicit and conflicted moral judgement in the word itself because very often when people say something is
  ‘unnatural’, they really mean ‘I do not approve of it’.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the idea that it is unnatural for human beings to be solitary is very ancient, and still exercises imaginative hold on many of us. When the Pentateuch – the first five books of
  Scripture which are held in common by the three Middle Eastern monotheisms (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) – was given its final form, somewhere between 600 and 400 BC, the second version of the Creation story (Genesis 2) tells how the Lord God made Adam, breathed life into him and put him in the Garden of Eden alone (there were not even any
  animals at this point) but then came to the conclusion that ‘it is not good that the man should be alone’. In an attempt to provide Adam with a fitting companion, the Lord God then
  ‘formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to the man’. However, none of them seemed quite satisfactory, so the Lord God made a woman out of one of
  Adam’s ribs. And he was no longer alone. Quite why this one verse of Genesis has kept its resonance while the rest of the creation story has been militantly rejected is a bit mysterious.</p>
<p>This particular story, and its explicit articulation that it is ‘not good’ for people to be alone, has been extremely influential, but it is not by any means unique; many other
  creation myths see the forming of human social units (often based on the sexually related couple, though sometimes on a sibling group) as a key moment in human development.</p>
<p>These myths are endorsed by popular science. The idea that human beings are a social species is not simply firmly embedded in our culture; it is supported by evolutionary theory, social
  anthropology and archaeology. And obviously it does have some validity; because of reproduction, virtually no animals can be entirely solitary, but there is enormous variety in their sociability.
  Some species of hamsters, for example, live extremely solitary lives, meeting each other very occasionally and almost exclusively for sex; other species, like ants or termites, are so highly
  socialized that huge numbers of the members of any particular colony are not even capable of reproduction but devote themselves to the very highly organized support of their fertile
  ‘queen’ and her young. But on the whole, popular ‘sociobiologists’ do not write bestsellers about termites and hamsters. They prefer more glamorous species.</p>
<p>Most of our closer animal relatives, particularly primates – and specifically chimpanzees, with whom we share a full 98 per cent of our genetic make-up – are social beyond the direct
  biological needs of feeding, reproduction and child-rearing: they play, groom each other, compete and fight, cooperate, exchange a range of vocalizations and continue to have relationships with
  their own weaned – even mature – offspring. For most primates their social relations transcend immediate family groups. Like humans, it is apparently unnatural for primates to be
  alone.</p>
<p>Homo sapiens have one particular behaviour that is not shared with other primates – organized hunting. The collective hunt is, inevitably, a communal and social experience. It has
  even been suggested that it is hunting as a group that led to the development of language, and the anthropological and archaeological evidence strongly supports the idea that the original human
  societies were hunter-gatherers. Because of this there has been a tendency to compare ourselves and our social needs to other species who also hunt collectively – especially wolves and
  lions.</p>
<p>But in making the claim that being alone is unnatural because we are fundamentally like other primates and hunting species, it is important to take a wider view of a species’
  ‘lifestyle’.</p>
<p>Lion packs are female-led. However, a newly arrived male lion will kill all the immature offspring of his predecessor. We would not justify such behaviour in human societies on the grounds that
  it was ‘natural’.</p>
<p>Wolves are highly gregarious. But their social groups are organized on entirely familial lines. A pack usually consists of a group of sisters and their young and a single non-related male: if I
  set up house with my sisters, sharing a single man as a sexual partner and the father of all our children, this would not be seen as a ‘natural’ relationship.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the popular argument that it is somehow unnatural for human beings to be alone claims a scientific basis in the behaviours of primates and hunting-pack species. And to some extent
  this makes good sense: humans have a biological need for sociability, if for no other reason than that it takes so long for our young to become independent; our survival requires us to support and
  protect these generally pretty useless and vulnerable members, and that in itself needs some sort of social interaction (unlike, say, salmon, whose mothers abandon their eggs before they are even
  fertilized, let alone hatched). All the archaeological evidence of the earliest human societies, together with the anthropological studies of different societies, make clear that Homo
  sapiens is a social species and cements survival through a complex web of practical, kinship and cultural structures. It is ‘natural’ for humans to associate, cooperate and bond
  both emotionally and ritually.</p>
<p>But it is wrong to assume that this necessary sociability, even in the obviously complex forms that exist among primates, means that individuals of other species never spend time alone. This is
  simply not the case.</p>
<p>Gorillas sleep alone.</p>
<p>Gorillas, for example, despite living in groups, spread out and forage alone. They are capable of a range of vocalizations with distinct meanings – about twenty-five different sounds
  (‘words’) have been identified by researchers. One of the most common of these is a loud ‘hoot’, which can be heard for at least half a mile (0.8 km): obviously you do not
  need to communicate audibly over such a distance if you are never separate from the rest of your social group.</p>
<p>Gorillas also sleep alone. Each evening they ‘make camp’, constructing new individual nests either on the ground or in trees. A suckling baby gorilla nests with its mother, but as
  soon as it is weaned at about three years old, she teaches it to make its own nest and it sleeps there. Many animals sleep together even as adults, but the highly socialized gorillas (and other
  primates too) sleep by themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile orangutans, which are as nearly related to humans as gorillas, are far more solitary in their lifestyle. This species spends most of its daily life alone, although its young are more
  gregarious.</p>
<p>And not all lions or wolves live in packs: both species have a second form of organizational behaviour – individuals who live alone: the lone wolf and the nomad lion. Both lions and wolves
  may maintain this status for life, or move in and out of it, setting up new prides or packs. These less-socialized individuals are not rare and are not created by external or unusual traumas
  – they are, apparently, perfectly ‘natural’.</p>
<p>Culturally we like the idea of the close-knit social group, so we tend to ignore how much hunter-gatherer activity is best done alone. The socially organized big-game hunt is surprisingly
  inefficient: kill-rates vary from as low as 17 per cent up to about 40 per cent, which is not going to keep a community in food. Fishing, small-animal hunting and a great deal of vegetable
  gathering are frequently done alone. The more northerly, tundra- and taiga-based, hunter-gatherer societies are more dependent on meat, since there is less edible vegetation: their huge and
  famously complex reindeer hunts are highly socialized and collaborative – different small groups coming together to build elaborate traps and fences and runs to exploit the reindeer-herd
  migrations. But these spectacular events are seasonal (like the Common Shearing I discussed earlier) and can as easily be seen as ‘leisure’; most gathering and hunting and fishing is
  done more quietly alone.</p>
<p>The more, and the more sensitively, we look at what actually happens out there, beyond the boundaries of modernity – at the complexity of models and forms of social being – the more
  we will be sceptical about anything being purely ‘natural’ or ‘unnatural’. We will most certainly become increasingly aware that solitude, in greater or smaller
  quantities, is simply a normal part of how it is to be.</p>
