        <h3>¶ Censorship</h3>
<p>Censorship is one of the most frightening of all political restrictions, associated with tyranny, the banning of legitimate criticism, state-sanctioned abuse and dictatorship.</p>
<p>These are hugely legitimate concerns. However, they can make it harder for us to recognise a few ways in which certain kinds of censorship may be genuinely helpful to us and align with our best interests.</p>
<p>Good censorship starts from an admission that we suffer from a congenital weakness of the will (akrasia). There is so much we would like to do, eat, say and be, but we are horribly prone to be pulled towards less admirable patterns of behaviour. We give in to passing desires, we are defenceless before certain passions, and we end up acting in ways we profoundly regret. This isn’t a severe judgement about the failings of other people; it’s a frank confession of our own private inadequacies.</p>
<p>Good censorship takes our weaknesses seriously and wants to help us with them. It isn’t about a bossy instinct to clamp down on the rest of society; it’s the realisation that a well-calibrated dose of censorship might be of genuine assistance in our attempts to lead good lives. We may willingly give up the keys to someone else, surrendering to external authority in order to nurture our own best but fragile instincts.</p>
<p>We might, for example, end up profoundly grateful to live in a society that doesn’t make it too easy to eat the wrong things, to spend our money in fitful ways, to exploit other people through our purchases, to develop addictions, or to aggravate our febrile compulsive sides. It isn’t so much the authorities who might want this for us; it’s we who want it for ourselves. Good censorship limits our freedom to do anything in the name of liberating us to be who we want to become deep down. We may long for a little gently administered censorship to protect our best from our worst selves.</p>
