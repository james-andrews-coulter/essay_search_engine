        <h3>¶ Sexual Fetishes</h3>
<p>Sexual fetishes are points – parts of the body, clothes, scenarios – where our erotic excitement reaches a pitch. They are commonly frowned upon and understood as either entirely mysterious or very sinister. They are neither. They are closely connected with the deepest strands in our personalities and reflect some of our most sincere commitments and beliefs.</p>
<p>The things that turn us on are, at heart, almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we’d like things to be. They are small moments of Utopia enacted around points of our sexuality.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the fetish for rough sex. Modern life demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. But in our hearts, we might like to be very forceful occasionally, exploring a demanding and insistent side to us. We would like sometimes to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But in the real world, of course, this is made difficult by the fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status that would allow us to exercise power as we would want.</p>
<p>In our fetish, we dream that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint, no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fetish, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person.</p>
<p>Or consider the fetish for outdoor sex. We easily become shy about the public realm; we sense that we have to be guarded, on our best behaviour, out there in the elevators, public plazas, shopping centres and garage forecourts of the world. Even nature is seen as quite hostile – a cold, dangerous place where enemies may set upon us.</p>
<p>So the longing arises that we could be as much at ease in the outdoors, in public and in nature, as we can be at home. It would be a solution to a kind of oppression to have sex in the elevator, in the library stacks, out near the river … Sex outdoors is pleasurable for the same reasons as picnics are: they are ways of taming the world by taking the domestic out into it. Any activity that has become linked to the indoors can be blissful when done outside because it symbolises a conquest of our anxieties – it is a way of imagining being more at home in the world than we normally can be.</p>
<p>One can analyse almost any fetish (shyness, cardigans, flat shoes, boots, cigars, stockings, striped socks, etc.) and find similar structures: an anxiety and a corresponding longing, to which an erotic charge has become connected. Looked at like this, sexual scenarios can be explained to ourselves – and, crucially, to other people in our lives – in rational, sensible terms.</p>
<p>By talking like this, we can hope that sexual fetishes will become a little less shameful and a little less threatening – and our erotic solutions a bit more reasonable and, in their own way, a lot more logical.</p>
