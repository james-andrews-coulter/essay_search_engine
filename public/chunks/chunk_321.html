        <h2>7 Love</h2>
<p>In Book Ten of the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses, we’re introduced to one of the world’s more curious but telling myths: a Cypriot sculptor called Pygmalion has developed a problem with women. He has seen the daughters of a local man called Propoetus refuse to honour Venus, the goddess of love, and then turn to prostitution. As a result, he has decided he is ‘not interested in women’ and devotes himself to his work instead. But, for old time’s sake, he decides to carve a woman out of ivory, shaped into exactly the form he has always longed for. When she is finished, as he gazes up at her nakedness, Pygmalion discovers that he has fallen deeply in love. Bereft at the thought that she is merely a statue, he implores Venus to take pity on him. In exchange for a ritual offering, she turns the ivory figure into a real woman, who awakes and instantly reciprocates Pygmalion’s feelings. They fall into a rapturous kiss and he starts to explore her body (Ovid leaves the rest to our imagination). Soon after, Pygmalion and his lover decide to get married, have a child and live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Ernest Normand, Pygmalion and Galatea, 1881.</p>
<p>What is striking from a historical point of view is where and when this myth took off: Europe and North America in the second half of the nineteenth century. The story had always been known; now, suddenly, it became venerated. It was the second most painted subject in all of culture in this period — handled by, among others, Auguste Rodin, Jean-Léon Gérôme (four times), Edward Burne-Jones (five times), and Ernest Normand — as well as being interpreted by playwrights, songwriters and poets. The story’s popularity wasn’t a matter of chance; it coincided with a movement of ideas, known to historians as Romanticism, that flourished at this time.</p>
<p>Romanticism proposed a very different vision of relationships to that which had existed hitherto. It argued that passionate love was the only possible basis on which two people could form a good relationship: kindness, mild attraction, intellectual sympathy and a commitment to growing old in each other’s company were no longer enough. Nor was one meant to dwell on practical considerations such as views on money, household management, or the opinions of parents; such matters were now deemed ‘un-Romantic’. Romantics believed that true lovers would understand each other intuitively, without needing to use words; there would simply be a sudden sympathy of souls and a strong feeling that one had always known this person, perhaps in another life. Furthermore, love would be born immediately: one would lay eyes on someone and know at once. Through intuition, one could at a glance locate a person with whom to spend the rest of one’s days. The swifter and more dramatic the process, the safer the relationship was assumed to be. Thinking too much about love was a dangerous sign (and very un-Romantic too). There was certainly no need to have a conversation with one’s lover.</p>
<p>The Romantics assumed that true love involved a perfect combination of sexual attraction and spiritual sympathy; it was unimaginable that one wouldn’t be very turned on by a partner one loved, or find that one fancied someone whose character one found wanting (along the way, Romanticism turned adultery from a problem into a catastrophe). Romanticism reconfigured love as the entire meaning of life — not a passing adolescent fantasy or a species of madness, as it had until then typically been considered. No longer did friendship, work, religion, philosophy, hobbies, travel or politics hold out any promises: one’s happiness would be entirely dependent on locating a lifelong soulmate, who would render everyone and everything else superfluous.</p>
<p>One begins to see why the story of Pygmalion might have been rediscovered by Romanticism. He represented everything that this ideology believed in: his passion developed at first sight; he didn’t need to do any talking; he didn’t have to get to understand his statue-lover; he didn’t bother to find out about her views or aspirations.</p>
<p>Edward Burne-Jones, The Soul Attains, 1878.</p>
<p>Jean-Léon Gérôme, Pygmalion and Galatea, c. 1890.</p>
<p>He loved her completely and at the same time did not know a thing about her — beyond her shape. It was going to be forever and involve children, but not even a ‘hello’ was in order. Beneath a veneer of cultural prestige, the story was close to insanity or, more politely, just very Romantic.</p>
<p>Pygmalion’s influence on emotional culture was surpassed by only one other Romantic couple who also became a popular topic for late-nineteenth-century painters: Romeo and Juliet. Romanticism recategorised Shakespeare’s play from being judged among his weakest and most forgettable to his allegedly greatest work. London and Paris were not to be without a performance of the play throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. From a rather pitiful and implausible tale of teenage love, the play was re-evaluated as capturing everything that love was meant to be — for all people, for all time. The story of the boy and girl from Verona was meant to be a reliable guide to love for university graduates and recently qualified accountants; this was to be the compass by which married couples in Neuilly sur Seine and Leamington Spa were to navigate their emotions. This wasn’t simply entertainment; it was (the gory ending aside) a roadmap.</p>
<p>Ford Madox Brown, Romeo and Juliet, 1867.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Romanticism did not stay neatly within the confines of art and literature; it was not just an intellectual exercise. It began to influence people’s actual assessments of themselves and others. It altered what happened on trains and at parties, in bedrooms and in seaside resorts. One didn’t need to have read Ovid or Shakespeare to be affected; the Romantic influence pervaded one’s mind all the same. Its influence spread to every nation. Romanticism became the official religion of modernity, it filled in for our loss of faith in saints and deities and even encouraged us, not coincidentally, to call our lovers ‘angel’. The new religion’s victory became total. It could no longer be escaped or even thought about properly. It shaped the instinctive way in which a boy and a girl in downtown Manila might think of their emotions after seeing a film together, or guide a homemaker in Seattle in her assessment of her marriage.</p>
<p>People who didn’t feel Romantic emotions learnt to pretend they did — just to survive — and might feel that there was something very wrong with them for finding the Pygmalion story somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Along the way, Romanticism became the single greatest obstacle to our ability to have successful relationships; it became a disaster for love. To get a sense of the hurdles it created, we need only imagine how many problems Pygmalion and his carved wife might have run into in the years after their miraculous union — and how unprepared the cult of Romanticism would have left them (as it does all of us).</p>
<p>Romanticism works with a charmingly innocent view of our instincts — and the chances of their reliability. It forgets that what we call ‘falling in love’ tends to be a process of refinding a love that evokes for us the sort of emotional relationship we knew in childhood, which for many of us involved pain, distance, suffering, neglect and frustration. Our instincts tend to guide us not so much to a pure being who will finally make us happy so much as a troublingly familiar figure who will make us unhappy in just the way we are used to from childhood, and to whom we feel drawn by a psychological impulse to repeat patterns of suffering.</p>
<p>Not only does Romanticism venerate an instinct of which we should be hugely suspicious, it then drains us of any will to get to know our partners properly, because it suggests that we know them already. It makes conversation feel laborious. It associates patient analysis with pedantry: true lovers are meant to communicate by mysterious motions of the soul. The result is that, like Mrs Pygmalion, lovers end up as figments of each other’s over-hasty imaginations.</p>
<p>Abraham Solomon, First Class: The Meeting... and at First Meeting Loved, 1854.</p>
<p>This in turn leads us to outbreaks of sulking, whereby we become furious with our partners for having failed to understand us for things that we haven’t bothered to explain — so convinced are we that true lovers simply know what’s in their partner’s hearts. We develop unnecessarily militant views on sex; we imagine that we should be able to be totally honest about our desires but then find that sex and love can sometimes run in opposite directions — at which point we panic and may call time on otherwise perfectly sound relationships. So bewitched are we by the image of true lovers admiring everything about one another, we fail to see how much of love could be a business of two people gently guiding each other to become better versions of themselves. We insist, often crossly, that a true lover should accept us ‘for who we really are’ — a terrifying possibility at any point. We picture love as a feeling of awe at another’s perfection; we don’t remember that it might also be a species of patience and benevolence towards a partner’s frailties and less than admirable dimensions.</p>
<p>No wonder if the modern age has not only obsessed more about love than any other, it has also failed to help us embark upon and sustain relationships in which we can possibly succeed. The future won’t belong to Romanticism; it will belong to a proper analysis of Romanticism’s flaws, a historical post-mortem out of which will emerge a kinder, more thoughtful, more psychological and more benevolent approach. We will learn to send Pygmalion to therapy rather than the art gallery.</p>
