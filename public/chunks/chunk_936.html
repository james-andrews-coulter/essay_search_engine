        <h2>Better Love Stories</h2>
<p>We don’t particularly notice it day-to-day, but the stories our culture presents us with concerning love and relationships – via films, songs, novels and adverts – have a major subterranean influence on how we think and feel. They shape our sense of what is normal and hence of what is troublingly abnormal; they seed certain hopes and expectations and foster particular opportunities for disappointment, indignation or alarm.</p>
