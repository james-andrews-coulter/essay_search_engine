        <h2>THE MUSICAL PRELUDE</h2>
<p>As the guests enter the ceremonial space, solemn, ethereal music is played. It should be loud enough to encourage meditative silence in the audience. It is threshold music: we are leaving the familiar world of day-to-day concerns; there can be no more gossiping or cheery chat about parking. The mood is grave and solemn: something very sombre and serious is about to unfold.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, as the music comes to an end, the director enters and walks slowly to the platform and sits facing the audience. On a small table close to the director’s chair are two small books, two photographs and two rings; these will play important roles in the ceremony.</p>
