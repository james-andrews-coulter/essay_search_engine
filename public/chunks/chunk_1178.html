        <h2>4. Between the Ages</h2>
<p>Fascinating historical accounts of ageing are found in Thomas Cole’s The Journey of Life (Cambridge University Press, 1992) and David Hackett Fischer’s Growing Old in America (Oxford University Press, 1978). The Long History of Old Age, edited by Pat Thane (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), is wide-ranging and sumptuously illustrated, while Richard Sennett is an indispensable guide to the deep impact of The Culture of the New Capitalism (Yale University Press, 2007).</p>
<p>Betty Friedan provides a caustic view of America’s age segregation in The Fountain of Age (Jonathan Cape, 1993). The description of the female geriatric ward in a nursing home in Muriel Spark’s novel Memento Mori (Virago, 2010), where everyone is called Granny even if they’re not one, evokes ageing more effectively than any treatise, but Cicero’s De Senectute is still eloquent (W. Heinemann, 1989).</p>
