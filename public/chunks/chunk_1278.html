        <h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>It is the middle of the night in one of the largest cities in Southeast Asia. Maybe we arrived here in the late afternoon from another continent, or perhaps this bedroom on the forty-third floor is home. Either way, we are feeling lost. Sleep refuses to come. We open the curtains and see the city before us: 10 million people stretching out across kilometres from Petaling Jaya in the east to Pandan Indah in the west. The Exchange and the Petronas Towers light up the enveloping tropical night.
We feel restless, haunted and uneasy. Thoughts come at us from all directions: memories from our childhood, apprehensions about the future, snatched lyrics of pop songs and lines from films. Adverts blink at us outside, beseeching us to buy Sangkaya coconut ice cream and Subaru 4x4s. On the television, Shila Amzah is singing about forbidden love, there are reruns of old episodes of Manjalara and a camel race is coming in from Jeddah on Al Arabiya.
It’s easy to think it may just be us, that the problem must be some fragility in our own minds, but it can be therapeutic to hold on to another idea: that our occasional moods of paranoia, terror and isolation have to do with the intense peculiarities of modern cities. Nothing in our evolutionary history has prepared us to dwell in such places. Our particular upbringings may have given us a few distinct struggles, but a large part of our distemper can be attributed to trying to make ourselves at home amidst millions of strangers competing for attention, fighting for love, desperate to avoid humiliation and ruthless in their pursuit of status. For the largest part of our collective history, we lived in small groups: Our identity was assured, our roles were clear. No one asked us who we were or what we had achieved. There were no business cards Aas conferences. The mission was basic but mee evident; the options were limited, but so € risks of ignominy and exclusion.
We are so inured to modern cities that it can be hard to see just how much they ask of us and the toll they exact. They continuously excite in us fantasies of success, fame and lust and, at the same time, terrify us with threats of punishment and stigmatisation. They press us closely together and keep us meticulously apart. They leave us to stare out of high-rise windows at one another in the night, wondering what troubles or joys strangers may be going through, and sometimes longing to meet.
We easily fall into doubts as to our own significance and direction. Nothing we are and do can ever measure up to the brilliance of the famous ones. We are humiliated by the scale of the ambition and achievements glimpsed out of the window. Our nothingness is proved not, as in past ages, by the gods or by nature, but by our fellow human beings who put up the Kuala Lumpur Tower or run the Mid Valley Megamall.
The Greeks thought a civilised city should allow us to see the countryside from the central square, so that the human and the natural would always remain in harmonious co-existence. Here, we would need a helicopter to allow us to see to the end of the sprawl and the edges of the forest at Gunung Nuang. It might take days to cross the city on foot and, even then, we might never find a way out.
The therapeutic element is paradoxical; it isn’t that there is a particular solution. But there may be some relief in a diagnosis. We don’t need to shoulder all the blame. By coming to cities as extreme as Kuala Lumpur, we can more clearly understand dynamics that are just as present, though less in evidence, in more modest but equally challenging conurbations.
Whatever their freedoms and excitements, cities force our psyches to submit to degrees oF pressure we were not designed for. We aren’t randomly miserable or insane; we were just not
built for these towers of dreams.</p>
