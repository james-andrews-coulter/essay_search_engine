        <h2>11.Pretty Cities</h2>
<p>The majority of our days are spent on ugly streets. Ever since the development of concrete, steel and plastic, monstrosities have become the norm. Most of our cities are furiously ugly.</p>
<p>One (optimistic) view is that this might not matter very much. Perhaps we can be the same sort of people wherever we happen to be; the colour of the bricks or the design of windows surely leave the fundamentals of life unchanged.</p>
<p>And yet, as our travels show, we crave architectural and civic beauty, because we intuitively appreciate how much we are at the mercy of our architectural environments. We know we aren’t the same people wherever we go. In the middle of Frankfurt, Milton Keynes or Detroit, the ugliness hacks away at our souls. And in Trieste or Portland, Seville or Florence, our benign personalities expand</p>
<p>It would be a good deal easier if we could remain in much the same mood wherever we happened to be. It is maddening how vulnerable we are to the coded messages that emanate from buildings. In the best cities, the streets whisper of hope, dignity, community and friendship. They invite us to become the noblest versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>If we better understood the impact that ugly architecture has on our lives, its power to sap our spirits and give assistance to our worst selves, we’d surely legislate against it. But as yet, no politician who announced an intention to make the built environment more beautiful would prosper – or even be deemed sane.</p>
<p>In utopia, architecture would more fairly be interpreted as a branch of mental health, with a crucial role to play in public contentment. And bad design would – at last – be interpreted as the crime it is to the health of the collective spirit.</p>
<p>Until then, it is to travel – and the intelligent, soul-stirring streets of San Gimignano or Kyoto, Jaipur or Yangon – that we must direct our longings.</p>
