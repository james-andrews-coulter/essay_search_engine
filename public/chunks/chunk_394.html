        <h2>8. Respect Difference</h2>
<p>Recently there have been a number of books addressing this question of why extroversion seems to be valued so much more highly than introversion. Susan Cain’s Quiet:
  The power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking (Penguin, 2012) is a popular example and there are many others. My difficulty with most of these books is that they completely
  accept the totalizing binary division, but simply favour the opposite side: ‘it is entirely wonderful to be an introvert and you are somehow superior to the extroverts’. The
  Myers–Briggs Personality tests, which make introversion and extroversion a key division, and social dependence on them, has reinforced this oppositional approach. Nonetheless there are
  interesting differences and they are worth knowing more about.</p>
