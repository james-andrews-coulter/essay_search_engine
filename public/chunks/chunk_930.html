        <h3>2. Spontaneity vs Education</h3>
<p>Romantics have often been wary of teaching and instruction. They think that the best things in a relationship happen spontaneously; you don’t need to learn how to relate; you should follow your impulses. The idea that people might want to think rationally and exhaustively about who to be with or how to deal with the laundry or whether to have children strikes the Romantic as a misguided intrusion of education into things which should be natural (they like the notion of ‘love at first sight’).</p>
<p>Those of a Classical temperament don’t necessarily respect the current education system as we know it, but the abstract idea of education seems to them very important. They believe that training is vital if we are to avoid making too many mistakes in our emotional lives. The Classically minded person sees education as perfectly placed to make good the shortfalls of our wayward natures. We might need to learn how to understand our own needs, how to compromise and how to talk to, or have good-enough sex with, our partners.</p>
