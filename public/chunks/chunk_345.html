        <h3>1 Recalibration</h3>
<p>As European pioneers began cutting and shooting their way across the American continent in the early nineteenth century, one unlikely figure, a minor French-American businessman called John Audubon, followed in their wake. He was not after land, gold or bison hides. He was interested in birds, with which he had been fascinated since his childhood in Brittany, and he announced his intention to draw every species in America. In the end, he managed only 435 (there were 2,000 in total), which he etched on large copper engraved plates and collected together in one of the most successful books of the nineteenth century, The Birds of America, published between 1827 and 1838 (Queen Victoria had a copy, as did France’s Charles X and American President James Polk).</p>
<p>John Audubon, Mallard Duck, Plate 221 of Birds of America, 1834.</p>
<p>Many of Audubon’s birds were rare and unlikely ever to be seen in the wild by his audience. But one of his most popular illustrations was of one of the most common of all birds: the mallard duck. Mallards, with their bottle-green heads and white collars, are an immediately recognisable sight to almost anyone who has ever sat on a bench in an urban park in Europe or North America. Despite their ubiquity, it can be highly therapeutic to encounter one. Part of what makes them such a welcome sight is how entirely indifferent they are towards all of what and who we are. They’ll paddle around beside us, looking out for dragonflies or worms, without fear or favour.</p>
<p>Everything that we may think of as important, everything that agitates and stirs us, makes us feel shame or evokes longing, is of no concern whatsoever to a mallard. We may be an important person in society or one of the most insignificant or maligned; that is of no matter to the duck, who will as willingly take a bit of stale bread off the hand of a senior judge as off a convicted felon. The mallards care nothing for our turbulent histories, the dramas in our governments, the reversals in our economies, the shocks in the lives of our famous actors. Things have been progressing in pretty much the same way for centuries for them; the loss of the American colonies or Napoleon’s rout at Waterloo were not of any concern and nor are whatever emotions happen to be roiling and tormenting us today.</p>
<p>It could appear lonely to encounter such aloofness, but it is in fact the greatest relief from the agony of life in the human beehive, where everything that we say or do, all the gossip about us, our striving for reputation and our wounded pride, consume so much of our nervous energy and stir us in our uneasy nights. By enmeshing ourselves tightly with other humans, we not only cut ourselves off from fresh air, we deny ourselves the experience of ‘otherness’, of creatures who can put our own melodramas into perspective via their haughty disregard for our existence — and their laser-like focus on their own, utterly contrasting priorities.</p>
<p>Walking down a modern urban thoroughfare, the throb and dynamism of our benighted race is constantly on show. Our thoughts are drawn to what we have not yet achieved and what we still so badly want. The adverts implore us to shift our desires, the news enrages and perturbs us, information about our colleagues and acquaintances inflames our competitiveness. At this point, the mallard duck is not just another halfway interesting creature to spot while taking a pause on a walk. It’s a pillar of truth waiting for us in one of the ponds in Victoria Park or Lincoln Park, the Englischer Garten or Central Park, waiting to tell us something that almost nothing and no one else will in the large city: that not a thing about us, good or bad, regrettable or beautiful, is of any interest to anyone outside our own vainglorious bubble. In short, and very thankfully, they tell us that we don’t matter — and this is one of the most generous, kind and necessary messages that anyone in modernity could ever hear.</p>
