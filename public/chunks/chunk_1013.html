        <h2>A SPEECH ABOUT EACH PARTNER BY EACH PARTNER</h2>
<p>The aim is to explain some important things that you love and admire about your partner. You have decided to share a lifetime with them and this is an opportunity to tell them, others and most importantly yourself, as clearly as you can, what about them moves and impresses you.</p>
<p>Be honest rather than conventional. You might be attracted to things that aren’t usually thought of as loveable. Focus on details. Maybe they sometimes have a slightly shy smile that speaks of an endearing aspect of their character usually hidden under a more competent and confident surface; perhaps they become almost comically serious in conversation about certain topics and all their earnestness, which you find thrilling, comes to the fore. Possibly they are careful about how they arrange their shoes and you see in this an expression of their desire to take good care of things – you included, maybe.</p>
