            <h3>¶ Quiet Life, The</h3>
<p>A quiet life sounds like an option that only the defeated would ever be inclined to praise. The age is overwhelmingly alive to the benefits of active, social, complex and ambitious ways of living. Lauding a quiet life has some of the eccentricity of praising rain.</p>
<p>We are suspicious because the defenders of quiet lives have so often come from the most implausible sections of the community – slackers, hippies, the work-shy, the fired – those who seem like they never had a choice; people whose quiet lives appear to have been imposed upon them by their own ineptitude.</p>
<p>Yet, when we examine things further, busy lives turn out to have so many incidental costs that we have been collectively committed to ignoring. At the top, alongside our privileges, we may grow impoverished in curious ways. We may be able to shut down a factory in India, and our every word may be listened to with trembling respect within a vast organisation, but what we cannot do is admit that we are extremely tired and want to spend the afternoon reading on the sofa. We grow strangers to those who love us outside of our wealth and status, while depending ever more on the fickle attention of those for whom we are our achievements alone. Our children see ever less of us. Our spouses grow bitter. We may own the wealth of continents, but it has been ten years at least since we last had the chance to do nothing for a day.</p>
<p>At this point in history, we are so fixated on the idea that poverty must always be involuntary and therefore the result of lack of talent and indigence, we have trouble imagining that it might be the result of an intelligent and skilled person’s free choice based on a rational evaluation of costs and benefits. It might sincerely be possible for someone to decide not to take the better-paid job, not because they had no chance, but because – having surveyed the externalities involved – they did not think them worth it.</p>
<p>When we come to know the true price some ways of life exact, we may realise we are not willing to pay for the envy, fear, deceit and anxiety. Our days on earth are limited. For the sake of true riches, we may willingly, and with no loss of dignity, opt to become a little more reclusive, temperate and obscure.</p>
