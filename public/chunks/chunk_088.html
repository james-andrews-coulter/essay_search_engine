        <h2>‘Disaster is on the way; a catastrophe is coming’</h2>
<p>The inner critic loves to whip up terror; it keeps insisting that something appalling is about to arrive. You should beat this sadistic critic at their own game. Stop hoping that things are going to be fun and then allowing yourself to be scared of potential disaster. Pre-empt the attack. Yes, there may be problems, but in the end, so what? They can be dealt with. Life can go on even at a very reduced rate. People have been able to keep going with only one leg, or in exile, or down to one friend or a pittance. It can be handled.</p>
