        <h3>1Improving the instinct for completion</h3>
<p>We are not helpless before our instincts. By understanding the way they work, we can take steps to attenuate their worst consequences. We can learn to be intelligently suspicious of our first impulses, and submit them to reasoned examination before following their commands.</p>
<p>Not only do we need someone who possesses the qualities we need; we also require something else that our instinct fails to inform us about: a willingness in ourselves to hear the lessons and take the steps that will help us become the more rounded and balanced people we would like to be. The fact that the other possesses the relevant aptitude does not entail that we will be good at learning from them. Having the weakness doesn’t mean we’ll automatically be a willing and fast-learning pupil. We need to become better students of what we want the other to teach us.</p>
<p>Our instinct aims at completion but massively fails to register the difficulty of the process of being completed. Instinct might take us to someone who in principle has the strengths we’re missing, but the relationship becomes an agony when we grow offended by the idea of learning. We (understandably, but unfairly) feel we’ve got together with an oppressive tyrant who only notices our failings and is constantly on at us.</p>
<p>It’s not that instinct is stupidly wrong in the direction it points us to; it’s just that it is radically insufficient on its own. It is a good instinct, but, taken alone, it creates immense opportunities for relationship sorrows. A flourishing relationship should be a forum in which we teach each other many things and gracefully learn in turn. If we understand ourselves properly, we will know that there are many sides of us that need improvement. Love aims to be a safe arena in which two people can gently teach and learn how to grow into better versions of themselves. Teaching and learning does not symbolise an abandonment of love: it is the basis upon which we can develop into better lovers and, more broadly, better people.</p>
