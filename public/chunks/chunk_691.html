            <h3>¶ Teasing</h3>
<p>Teasing done with affection and skill is a profound human accomplishment. There is nasty teasing, of course, in which we pick away at a sore spot in someone’s life. But there is a genuinely valuable affectionate version, generous and loving, which feels good to be on the receiving end of.</p>
<p>All of us become a bit unbalanced in one way or another: too serious, too gloomy, too jokey. We all benefit from being tugged back towards a healthier mean by a well-aimed, tenderly delivered tease. The good teaser latches onto and responds to our distinctive quirks and is compassionately constructive about trying to reconnect us with our better selves – not by delivering a stern lesson, but by helping us to notice our excesses and laugh at them. We sense the teaser trying, with love, to give us a useful shove in a good (and secretly welcome) direction.</p>
<p>The best teasing remarks emerge from genuine insights into who we are. A person has studied us, put their finger on a struggle that’s going on in us and has taken the part of the highest – but currently under-supported – side of us. This feels so good because, only too often, others simply don’t see past the forbidding or off-putting front we assume for the world; they have no imagination to detect the kinder self beneath the tricky surface. They simply think we are gloomy, stern, angry or obsessed. The teaser does us the favour of recognising that the dominant front doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Teasing is a subtle, powerful mode of teaching. It builds on a hugely important insight about human beings: criticism of any kind is exceptionally hard to absorb; we are slow and reluctant learners, with well-observed tendencies to ignore and turn against those who try to lecture us. By amusingly exaggerating our exaggerations, teasing combines criticism with charm. The negative point is real, but it is carefully wrapped in kindness and disguised as entertainment – and is therefore much easier to take on board. It seduces us into virtue. (‘If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they’ll kill you’, knew George Bernard Shaw.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the most instructive question we can ask – the one that teaches us most about the value of affectionate teasing and of the path we still need to take towards emotional maturity – is simply: what do I need to be teased about?</p>
