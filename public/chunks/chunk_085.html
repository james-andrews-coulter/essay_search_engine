        <h2>‘Everyone else knows how to live apart from you’</h2>
<p>Another characteristically harrowing suggestion. In fact, we don’t know about others. We only know people from the outside, from what they decide to tell us, and naturally they hide all the bad bits that we’re only too aware of in ourselves. Almost certainly, others are going out of their minds and are racked by guilt and fear. Naturally, a few people appear to have perfect lives, but that’s only because you don’t know them well enough. No one is normal or very happy from close up. Life is a struggle for everyone. Stop comparing what you know of your deep self with the advertising hoardings others have put up about their lives.</p>
