            <h3>¶ Sulking</h3>
<p>Sulking combines a powerful symbolic articulation of anger with an intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about. One both desperately needs to be understood and yet is profoundly committed to not making it easy for another person to understand one.</p>
<p>The stance is no coincidence. One remains silent and furiously gnomic because having to spell out the offence another has caused feels contrary to the spirit of love, interpreted in a Romantic sense: if the other requires an explanation, it is proof they are not worthy of being granted one. After all, true love should be about mutual speedy intuition, not laborious articulation.</p>
<p>In a sense, it is an odd privilege to be the recipient of a sulk, for one tends to fall into a sulk only with people whom one feels should understand one, in whom one has placed a high degree of trust, and yet who appear to have broken the contract of the relationship. We would never dare to storm out of a room, call someone a shit and stay silent the rest of the evening in an upstairs room unless one was with a partner whom one believed had a profound capacity to understand one, which they had – strangely, probably out of spite – chosen not to use on this occasion. It is one of the stranger gifts of love.</p>
<p>Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, yet in practice catastrophic, Romantic ideal of love: that of being understood without needing to speak. At a deep level, the structure of the sulk reveals a debt to earliest childhood. In the womb, we never had to explain what we needed. Food and comfort simply came. If we had the privilege of being relatively well parented, some of that idyll may have continued in our first years. We didn’t have to make our every need known; someone guessed for us. They saw through our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions, and found the explanations when we didn’t have the ability to verbalise them. The sulker continues to want to be interpreted the way they once were.</p>
<p>The cure is a dose of pessimism. We should be reminded of the unfairness of wanting every aspect of our souls to be grasped without us needing to say a word. It is not necessarily an insult to be misunderstood and called upon to communicate. When our lovers fail to fathom us and unwittingly barge into our more tender sides, it isn’t an immediate sign that they are heartless. It may merely be that we have grown a little too committed to not teaching them about who we are.</p>
