        <h2>Pedalino</h2>
<p>Ideally, we would agree to live only where lemon trees grow, a favoured zone between the 40° parallel in the north and the 40° parallel in the south, which includes California, Uruguay, South Africa, Italy, Spain and Greece. The trees have intuitively put their roots on certain of the ideal ingredients for fulfillment. They need nine hours a day of sunshine, a temperature of between 20° and 25° Celsius, little wind, protection from frosts, a good amount of room from their neighbours and occasional gentle pruning. Under such conditions, they will from their fourth year on reliably produce some sixty lemons a tree for thirty years.
Here in Sicily, it will be the Siracusa or femminello lemon, the skin of which is particularly delicate and flavoured and which can be eaten whole. The lemon was said to have been brought to Sicily by the Arab Emir Ibrahim II early in the 10th century, having first been grown in Assam in northeast India. It has sunk deep into Sicilian culture. Its relief is sculpted in several churches on the island, it has had songs dedicated to it and it has acquired a saint, St Lucia and special powers of revenge. (Supposedly it’s possible to make an enemy fall ill by taking a lemon to Mass, sticking pins in it and throwing it into a well.) It anchors a range of recipes Sicilian lemon cake, lemon marinade, lemon pappardelle, granita, salmoriglio but it works as well squeezed into some cold water or directly onto the tongue.
As usefully, it is an object for contemplation. It’s a perfect symbol of hope. It has condensed the hours of sunshine it has grown in and beams these back to us, even in midwinter, from a window ledge or a bowl, in a way that can alleviate our dejected moods and remind us of reasons to endure. The lemon understands pain well enough. It isn’t a cosseted and overly delicate fruit. It grows in hard rocky soil, its skin is somewhat mottled and its shape irregular, but it insists on cheerfulness nevertheless. Its yellow is always vivid, and its taste reliably vibrant and tart.
It’s easy for an attitude of hope to fall under suspicion. It can seem close to naivety. Sadness and alarm can seem the more grown-up and prestigious options. But after we have cried all we need to, and spent a good deal of time under the covers, hope reasserts its importance. It is what we need to rely on to return once again to fractured relationships, frustrated business plans or unsatisfactory families.
To walk along the rows of a Sicilian lemon orchard on a clear morning, catching the combined scents of thousands of fruit, can be enough to challenge even the most entrenched melancholy. Of course much has gone wrong; it always does (though we too seldom have an appropriate grasp of just how widespread difficulties are in every life), but there remain small pockets of beauty and kindness. The lemon is our mind’s ally in its never-finished quest to ward off tides of despair. It is the guardian of confidence and trust. In a perfect religion, the lemon would be the chief sacred object, deified and often in view, reminding us of life’s potential; an imaginary repository for all that we too often lose sight of in our moods of fear and exhaustion.</p>
