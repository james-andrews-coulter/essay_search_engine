        <h2>Salginatobel Bridge</h2>
<p>The Salginatobel Bridge is a 133-metre-long reinforced-concrete span that connects the villages of Schiers and Schuders in the canton of Graubiinden in eastern Switzerland. It was designed in 1929 by the 57-year-old Swiss engineer Robert Maillart and carries a road over a 90-metre gorge through which runs the Salgina Brook and around which golden eagles circle, on the lookout for squirrels and marmots below.
Until the 20th century, all bridges that our species ever made relied on stone, wood or steel, but Maillart found a way of using concrete to convey an impression of lightness and ease even as his three-hinged arch bridge hangs over a precipitous drop.
The bridge models for us how we might be both powerful and tender. It can carry a procession of school buses or tanks on its back in safety; it can function uncomplainingly through the deepest winter snows, in the heaviest downpours and when the wind is howling along the valley. But it understands how not to make a fuss: it discreetly avoids letting on how difficult its task really is. If this were a person, it wouldn’t let its partner know all the strenuous things it sometimes does for them. It wouldn’t sigh and explain: I listen to you when I’m slightly bored; I got your sister a nice present at Christmas, even though I find her irritating; I agreed to go camping, though it’s my least favourite kind of holiday; I can’t stand the pile of newspapers and magazines you keep on the kitchen table, but ! don’t clear them away because I know you like having them there. It would undertake the labours of love without letting the loved one know the efforts it had made: it might not admit how many times it had stayed up late worrying or had cried itself to sleep with frustration. It Says less than it needs to.
The bridge is an emblem of how technology can intervene in the natural world without destroying it. A human creation need not always ruin the landscape it sits in. The grandeur of the gorge is enhanced, not wrecked, by Maillart’s bridge; its elegance joins with what we love in the ancient pine trees and the steep rocks of the sides and the cascades of the stream.
The underlying feat of the Salginatobel Bridge isn’t to link a couple of alpine villages; it’s to help us feel proud of ourselves. Here is a massive strength that can leap like an ibex over a gorge or can carry us on its shoulders like a loving parent bearing a child over a swollen river. The human stamp, even on a large scale, can sometimes show off what is best in us.</p>
