        <h2>Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs</h2>
<p>They got into a fight one day, 83 million years ago, on a bleak ridge in what is now the Gobi Desert, 600 kilometres south of the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar which was then part of a lush forest teeming with Therizinosaurus, Ankylosaurus and Velociraptor and echoing at night to the martial cries of Protoceratops and armoured Tsagantegia. It’s unclear what got them into their conflict. Perhaps they were arguing over a nest of flavoursome Quaesitosaurus eggs, or both had their eyes on an identical baby Nemegtosaurus. Whatever the dispute, it proved to be the end for both of them: they took bites out of each other’s thin necks with their sharp toothless beaks and then fell into a mortal tangle, their bodies disappearing into the sandy ground until their discovery by an all-female team of Polish palaeontologists from Warsaw in the early 1970s.
Today they have pride of place in the main hall of the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs (formerly the Lenin Museum) in central Ulaanbaatar. Beside them stands a perfectly intact skeleton of a Tarbosaurus bataar, the Asiatic twin of the more famous Tyrannosaurus rex, as well as a full skeleton of an Oviraptor, known for its unusually large brain and tenderness towards its children (they have been found hunched protectively over nests full of eggs).
Mongolia’s desert floor is a graveyard filled with the corpses of Achillobator and Udanoceratops, Pinacosaurus and Erketu. None of these were a brief presence; they collectively thrived in the region for 79 million years (between 145 and 66 million years ago), until the disastrous day more coldly known in science as the K-Pg extinction event, when an asteroid 10 kilometres wide slammed into the Gulf of Mexico and brought matters to a sharp close.
Our brains aren’t well suited to holding
on to the idea of how precariously positioned
our species is; we assume things to be more or less solid. We’re not expecting anything to fly in from outer space. We think it’s an achievement that we date back 200,000 years. Those 6-metre-long Gallimimus combatants in the Ulaanbaatar museum held out for 17 million years, yet still they have gone. There have been five mass extinctions since the earth began. Five times, a majority of living things have been wiped out and most of complex life has had to begin anew. Any sober assessment of our future has to acknowledge the unlikelihood that we will make it in the long term.
Sooner than we might think, we will be dug out of the earth and shown off in an exhibit and may appear as puzzling and as incidentally sweet to our successors as the parrot-beaked Psittacosaurus and speedy little Mononykus seem to us.
The Ulaanbaatar museum isn’t trying to make us give up; yet it might well encourage us to approach ourselves and our squabbles with a little more generosity of spirit and lightness of heart, underpinned by an awareness of how ridiculously and inconsequentially brief it
will all be.</p>
