            <h3>¶ Androcles and the Lion</h3>
<p>A traditional fable tells of a lion prowling villages at night, roaring horribly. Everyone is terrified, so they want to kill the beast to feel a bit safer. One day, in the nearby hills, a shepherd gets caught in a sudden storm and seeks shelter in a cave – where the lion has made his home. The terrified shepherd called Androcles imagines he’s about to be ripped to pieces. Then he notices there’s a thorn in the lion’s paw: the creature is in agony and his terrible roars are his way of trying to express his pain. The shepherd takes a risk: he goes up and removes the thorn. The lion stops roaring, becomes gentle, licks the shepherd’s hand and they become friends.</p>
<p>In the fable, the ‘lion’ represents someone who frightens us. We assume they are determined to destroy us. But the story suggests an alternative explanation: the frightening person is suffering (psychologically rather than physically). It is their pain that drives them to behave in ways that distress and scare us. If we can be brave enough to notice, acknowledge and in some very tender manner address their suffering, we start to take away the cause of their aggression.</p>
<p>The French philosopher Émile-Auguste Chartier (known as Alain) was said to be the finest teacher in France in the first half of the 20th century. He developed a formula for calming down himself and his pupils in the face of irritating people. ‘Never say that people are evil,’ he wrote; ‘You just need to look for the pin.’</p>
<p>What he meant was: look for the source of the agony that drives a person to behave in appalling ways. The calming thought is to imagine that they are suffering off-stage, in some area we cannot see. To be mature is to learn to imagine this zone of pain, despite the lack of available evidence. They may not look as if they were maddened by an inner psychological ailment: they may look aggressive or full of themselves. But the ‘pin’ simply must be there – or they would not be causing us harm.</p>
