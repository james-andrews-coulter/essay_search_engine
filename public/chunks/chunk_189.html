        <h1>4. The Finer Connections</h1>
<p>‘It is possible to spend a lifetime in a magellanic voyage around the trunk of a single tree.’</p>
<p>(EDWARD O. WILSON)</p>
<p>We tend to become familiar with our home habitats first and the regulars that will be found there. This familiarity is what makes it easy to spot change. Think of your
  favourite song, one you know off by heart and have listened to a thousand times. If an artist released a remix of this song, the change would be instantly noticeable to you – it might even
  jar. But to someone who was unfamiliar with the original, the new version would be harder to distinguish. Once we learn to recognize the background sounds, we start to pick out each new note
  instinctively.</p>
<p>I live in the South Downs; it is chalk country and beech forests abound. Inevitably, I have become familiar with the dependable cohorts of these shady woodlands: grey squirrels, deer, pheasants,
  orchids and the beech-loving fungi, like the saffrondrop bonnet, Mycena crocata. These organisms form the expected canvas, but I will be quickly intrigued by anything that stands out as
  less than common. A pheasant will not drag my eyes upwards for long, but a white-tailed eagle would.</p>
<p>Nature is a series of specialists and their partners. Fungi and forests work in tandem; vast subterranean networks of fungi fix nitrogen for the trees that offer the perfect habitat for them. If
  we spot the specialist, we will likely find the partner. For example, the cinnabar moth caterpillar can only feed on ragwort, so if we spot one, we can be confident of finding the other.</p>
<p>From the rodents that colonize the London Underground, through the ‘railway poplars’ that screen many urban railway lines, to the bright green lichens that cling to the wind-scoured
  rocks of the mountains of north Wales – no habitat is off-limits to the inquisitive mind looking for specialist species. Studies have been done into the microhabitats that are cemeteries and,
  rather wonderfully for lovers of all things vampire, these areas have been found to offer important insect-rich feeding areas for bats.</p>
<p>If you spend enough time in a place, the regulars introduce themselves, and their reason for choosing that place is usually easy to work out. Sometimes it is a little trickier, but then the
  sport of puzzle-solving commences. There is a peculiar satisfaction in cracking nature’s riddles: why do these pigeons always use exactly the same flightpath? Aha! They are following the road
  below. Pigeons, like many other birds, follow lines in the ground like motorways and rivers.</p>
<p>When the shapes and colours of a habitat become familiar to us and the individual species attract our curiosity, we will be confronted with an important and much-dreaded
  hurdle: species identification and names. More people have felt an early interest in nature snuffed out by the tyranny of species names than probably any other single factor.</p>
<p>Depending on your experience, you may have sensed a mild dismay on encountering the Latin name of the fungus, Mycena crocata, at the start of this chapter. I deliberately squeezed it in
  there to help make this point. I don’t know whether it is the way many subjects are taught at school that sows a long-term loathing of such things, but most people find subjects with a lot of
  new names forbidding. The study of the natural world is absolutely stuffed with them: common names, Latin names, nicknames and names that are impossible to pronounce. But however unpalatable the
  words Mycena crocata may be at first, we do need some way of differentiating between species.</p>
<p>If names feel like a stumbling block, then there are a couple of fun ways around this problem. Firstly, banish fear of getting something wrong, because it is impossible. There are no rights or
  wrongs, just invented words. Names are a convention, a very useful one for many of us at times, but if they are not proving useful for you at any one time, then they serve no purpose at that
  moment. The only time you are likely to fear getting a name wrong is when you are trying to convey the identity of something to another person, and there are many other ways of doing this. If you
  want to call something ‘that stringy green thingy with a white flower that looks like a gramophone’, then that is as correct as calling it hedge bindweed or Convolvulus sepium,
  for that matter. After a few times using that long expression, you may start to see a little beauty in the shorter names, but if not, so be it!</p>
<p>Sadly, the natural world is not short of people who believe that rattling off Latin names incessantly makes them appear clever, whereas most of us know instinctively that this suggests
  insecurity at best, but possibly social and sexual dysfunction as well. If somebody corrects you sternly by using an obtuse name for something, they probably know neither human nature nor any other
  kind very profoundly.</p>
<p>When I teach people how to use the stars to find their way, one of the first things I say is, ‘Shapes and the way these shapes move in the sky are very important for natural navigators.
  Names never have been and never will be. Call it the Plough, the Big Dipper, the Saucepan or part of Ursa Major – you will not change the way it looks or the way it can be used to find the
  North Star.’</p>
<p>The second fun way to beat names at their own game is to don a deerstalker hat, light a pipe and enjoy the clues within. The common names of most plants and animals will contain interesting
  indicators as to the characteristics of their owners, and these can offer rewarding insight. Instead of viewing names as an obstacle to experience, with practice they come to be seen as a gateway.
  The saffrondrop bonnet fungus mentioned earlier bleeds a rich orange when bruised, and once you have seen the gore of this orange blood you are unlikely to forget this fungus or its name
  quickly.</p>
<p>Names are dead words until we find meaning in them, but as soon as we do, the species behind them can find new life in our imagination. Take the words ‘ghost orchid’. We may know
  what an orchid is and we may be familiar, from Scooby Doo if nowhere else, with what a ghost is. However, ‘ghost orchid’ isn’t likely to stick in our minds for long
  unless we find some meaning to that pairing. If a friend returns from a walk in the woods and announces that they saw a roe deer, a brown owl and a ghost orchid, then they may possibly be a little
  underwhelmed by our response of, ‘That’s nice.’</p>
<p>Once we learn that ghost orchids earned their name because they are one of the rarest plants in Britain and can disappear from a site for whole decades at a time, before reappearing briefly, the
  name comes to life a bit. The next time someone announces they have seen a ghost orchid, we can oblige them by falling off our chair in the expected manner.</p>
<p>Finding the North Star.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to see a very rare plant or animal, but that does not on its own give us a connection. It might be a good idea for us to draw a couple of the strands together at this point.
  Imagine you are walking down a country lane in May and someone next to you points to a yellow flower and says, ‘Look, St John’s wort is out already,’ you should not feel ashamed
  to find yourself unmoved. Nor is there any need to offer a gruff retort in the form of, ‘Do I look bothered?’ Instead, take a moment to look at the flower, enjoy peering at its little
  yellow spikes and then, at your leisure, investigate the name. The next time you walk down that same country lane you will be able to turn to a new walking companion and explain that St
  John’s wort earned its name because it was traditionally known to flower on St John’s day, 24 June. The flower’s Latin name, Hypericum perforatum, makes more sense once
  you have held one of its leaves up to the light. They have small oil glands in them, which do give them a perforated appearance. The word Hypericum comes from the Greek words
  hyper and eikon, ‘above’ and ‘picture’, from the tradition of hanging a plant over a picture to ward off evil on St John’s Day, this being a plant
  that has a reputation for doing just that. St John’s wort is widely used to treat depression, and there is scientific evidence backing its use for certain cases.</p>
<p>If your friend finds this interesting, you might choose to reveal the fruits of your further research. It was once believed that a childless woman could walk out naked to pick the St
  John’s wort flower, and this would lead to her conceiving within a year. And if your friend raises an eyebrow, you might add, ‘However, it is possible that the flower played only a
  small part in these fertility trials: walking about naked in midsummer might have been a good way of introducing new mates into the equation. Varieties like winter heliotrope are unlikely to have
  earned such a reputation, as naked rambling in December might be considered mad, not licentious.’</p>
<p>The elusive ghost orchid.</p>
<p>By this point there is a danger that your companion will be making judgments about your own social skills, so it will be time to move on to the next exhibit.</p>
<p>You will, however, have demonstrated to your own satisfaction that, with a little curiosity, dead words spring to life and the name of this one plant allows us to feel a connection with history,
  medicine and sex. The name has allowed it to metamorphose in our minds from a yellow flower into a calendar and then a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Nature is often like a painting that seems dull until you start to learn more about it. Van Gogh added yet more piquancy to the vibrancy of his art by cutting off part of his ear. His paintings
  change in our minds, without changing physically, when we learn more about the story that surrounds them.</p>
<p>Take a look at the two flightless birds on the opposite page and assess how you feel looking at these two creatures. Granted these are motionless black-and-white photographs, but it is hard to
  feel for either subject in each case.</p>
<p>Let me give you a little backstory on these two birds. The first, the male emperor penguin, will allow his hungry partner to go off and feed after she has laid the egg, while he fasts so that he
  can protect their egg for four months. He will endure winds of 120 mph and temperatures that fall to lower than –40°c. He is the only male penguin to do this without help from the
  female.</p>
<p>A penguin and a cassowary. Do you feel anything?</p>
<p>The second, the cassowary, is another large flightless bird. Its second ‘toe’ is a lethal nail-like spike that can tear flesh – a cassowary once killed a 16-year-old boy by
  piercing his neck. Look back at the photographs. It is a little easier to feel something with some background. You can see it in their eyes now, can’t you?</p>
<p>No longer intimidated by apparent disorder, it is time to heighten the senses, to detect the anomalous: peer deeper, listen more hungrily and sniff for change. We are at the
  stage where we can look forward to fresh discoveries, to finding new keys to unlock our surroundings.</p>
<p>The competitive pressure of survival is tough on new life, but kind to the naturalist, because it means that each species we find has a story to reveal about the place where we stand and the
  time we spend there. If we walk through a dense woodland we will not be surprised to find plants that can thrive in the shade. In spring we might be treated to a carpet of bluebells, but alert
  senses may help us to spot stronger clues to time and place.</p>
<p>The winter aconite flower is an early bloomer, as its name suggests, but getting to know this flower reveals more than a clue to the time of year. If, peering closely, we notice its petals
  furled in the early morning and unfurled in the afternoon, we can take some satisfaction in having observed one of nature’s many thermometers: the winter aconite’s petals only open when
  the air temperature rises above 10°c.</p>
<p>In another patch we may find wood anemone, wood sorrel and woodruff. Each of these plants is a poor colonizer and together they indicate that a woodland habitat is ancient. A picture begins to
  build of place and time, one that has always been there, but which is seen by few, or, as the French philosopher Henri Bergson put it, ‘Disorder is simply the order we are not looking
  for.’</p>
<p>Our senses can also reveal which animals have come to share each moment with us. There is a strong tradition of ‘birding by ear’, that is, identifying birds by their calls and then
  building a picture of a territory by the sounds of the birds. This may sound steeply technical at first, but it is accessible and fun to try. The full art takes years to hone, but the general
  approach can be understood with the help of a few words. The yellowhammer calls with a rhythm that can be evoked with the sentence, ‘a little bit of bread and no cheese’.</p>
<p>Strange, but you get the sound-picture. And the name-detective in you may already have deduced that this is indeed a bird with yellow feathers: hama is an Old English word for skin,
  covering or feathers.</p>
<p>There are other word games that can help us build a different picture. ‘Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain’ will win few prizes as a history lesson, but it works better as a neat
  way of remembering the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet sequence in a rainbow. No matter how many times I see a rainbow, I still love checking the outcome of that particular
  conflict. History does indeed repeat itself.</p>
<p>Ears and eyes cocked to the skies for birdsong and rainbows, we may find our feet trying to tell us about a much smaller creature. It is common in summer to find a stickiness on the ground under
  Lime trees. This is the work of the aphids that gorge on the tree’s sap and then drop the excess sugars below them as a honeydew. There are moulds that thrive on these sugars and form dark
  patches on cars that park regularly under lime trees. Note to selves: do not park under trees with leaves that are heart-shaped with toothed edges.</p>
<p>Almost everything that our senses pick out is eager to tell us a story that will help us make a connection. The constellation Hercules is itching to boast all about the times he slayed a lion,
  an eagle and a swan. These victims will be found in the nearby constellations of Leo, Aquila and Cygnus. The plant Danish scurvy-grass, which tolerates salt, earned its name after it was eaten by
  sailors returning from long periods at sea to satisfy their mortal craving for vitamin C. It has more recently come to colonize the verges of major roads, where we have accidentally created coastal
  conditions by spreading salt in winter.</p>
<p>It does not take an encyclopaedic list to demonstrate that these finer connections are out there, everywhere, waiting for us to find them. The important thing for us to remember is that nature
  is a set of keys and interlocking connections. It sometimes takes a little patience to work out how to open a new lock, but the keys are there and the reward on the other side is a recipe for a
  form of alchemy. Once we see the way all of nature is interconnected we have a way of turning time in the fresh air into a richness of experience. And, unlike the alchemy of old, it works.</p>
