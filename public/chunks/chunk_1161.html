        <h2>FROM THE PARENTS ON BOTH SIDES</h2>
<p>A parent has known this person from infancy. They knew them when they were gauche, vulnerable and entirely at the mercy of others. They understand who they were and in powerful ways still are. Parents are the agents of one particular kind of love. They loved this person when the love couldn’t be equal. Here are some guidelines for such a speech:</p>
<p>Your child is an adult now. But for a long time they weren’t. They’re not simply the person they are today; they are still also the child they were. We need to know about the child.</p>
<p>In what ways were they endearing when they were little? Describe something you loved doing with them.</p>
<p>What difficult things did you have to do for them – things that were no fun at all but that you did out of love for them? You did so much (probably).</p>
<p>Perhaps a lot of the time, you did it with good will, but maybe not always. In what ways were you a bad parent? How did you fail them? What pressures in your life made you a problematic adult to be around? What might you do differently if there was another opportunity?</p>
<p>You are reminding everyone that love involves sacrifice but also failure. We are imperfect beings, and cannot get by without ample forgiveness.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be funny or very wise or give advice. Indeed, you should refrain from doing so. Jokes are especially problematic. You are here to provide information.</p>
