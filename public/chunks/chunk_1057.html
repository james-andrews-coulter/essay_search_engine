        <h2>5.Small Pleasures</h2>
<p>To generalise, our age believes in Big Pleasures. We’ve inherited a romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find or deeply unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. We subtly like high prices. If something is cheap or free, it’s a little harder to appreciate.</p>
<p>The approach isn’t wholly wrong, but unwittingly it exhibits a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary and the small-scale.</p>
<p>Yet the paradoxical aspect of pleasure is how promiscuous it can prove to be. It doesn’t neatly collect in expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us in the big museum. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods.</p>
<p>Travels are often filled with small pleasures. Perhaps it was the rye bread on the terrace of the hotel, the field of dandelions near the canal, a conversation with someone washing clothes at a fountain, the sound of the city heard on a walk through the park at night…</p>
<p>Such things can lack prestige or social support. They sound rather minor. They wouldn’t be what one would ordinarily pick out as highlights of a journey.</p>
<p>Yet a pleasure may look very minor – eating a fig, saying a word in a new language, browsing in a spice shop – and yet be anything but. If properly grasped and elaborated upon, these sorts of activities may be among the most moving and satisfying we can ever hope to have.</p>
