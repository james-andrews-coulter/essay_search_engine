            <h1>Physical Activity</h1>
<p>To stay sane we need to increase the good stress that is generated by engaging not only in more intellectual pursuits but also in physical activity. The brain needs oxygen and the more oxygen it gets the better it functions. Two studies have demonstrated this clearly. In the first, two groups of sedentary elderly people were tested in four areas: memory, executive functioning, concentration, and the speed with which they could perform various physical tasks, from threading a needle to walking along a line. For the next four months, those in the first group walked for twenty minutes a day; those in the second group carried on as normal. Then they were tested again. Group 1 showed significant improvements in the higher mental processes of memory and executive functions that involve learning, planning, organization and multi-tasking. The implication is that exercise might be able to offset some of the mental declines that we often associate with the ageing process. The second study was carried out on patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. The first group was given medication alone, the second exercise alone and the third medication and exercise together. The results showed that exercise is as helpful as medication in combating depression, as all three groups showed statistically significant and identical improvement in standard measurements of depression.</p>
<p>It is often the case when we are considering embarking on a new activity (be it ballroom dancing, meditation or other new ventures) that we feel in two minds about it. However, if we decide to override that part of us that is reluctant to change (instead of merely trying to override it), and undertake a new regime anyway, we give ourselves the chance to experience the difference that new regime makes to us. If we are not feeling more stimulated, more interconnected, more alive, no harm will have been done and we can drop it. Starting a new habit means feeling the impulse to maintain your current way of being, but beginning the new regime anyway: it can feel like a wrench. We usually start to send ourselves messages – like ‘this isn’t really me’ – clock such excuses and decide to persevere with establishing a new habit anyway.</p>
