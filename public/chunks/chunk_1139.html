        <h2>Alfriston, Sussex</h2>
<p>It looks at first sight like a terrifying disaster, The River Cuckmere, normally so placid and so picturesque, has ignored the limitations set down by nature, burst its banks and spread its flood waters and its mud across miles of ordinary countryside, inundating fields and footpaths where animals and humans only recently passed.
However, closer inspection and local knowledge reveal that this is nothing of the sort. The River Cuckmere lies in a long-established and well-marked floodplain. Rains and mud are expected here, not necessarily every year, but often enough. Acres of farmland have deliberately been left so that, should the river burst its banks after torrential rains and high tides, they can turn into gigantic lakes for a time without suffering any damage. The humans in the area have long memories, and they know what this apparently placid river can do. It might be quiescent for a while, but sure enough, it will flood once more and woe to anyone who had thought of building themselves a house with a veranda, let alone setting up a power line, in such terrain.
There is, in this curious accommodation of the powers of nature, a psychological lesson on offer. A flood does not need to be the end, so long as we have prepared for it have carefully dug drainage ditches, evacuated livestock and moved everything delicate onto higher ground. A good life is similarly one in which we can expect much to go wrong, and should not be banking on anything remaining trouble-free for long. The point isn’t to try to avoid flood waters or to try to create impermeable dams to stop them. It’s to cede to problems with grace when we need to and then mitigate their effects. We might have to surrender a lot of territory: the land around the River Cuckmere indicates as much. We might have to write off an entire portion of our lives. We might have to go to hospital or waste many days in bed, but we can do so in the knowledge that we were never assured an easier, unproblematic path.
Mental unwellness, terror, loneliness, loss and anguish belong to the business of living. We cannot hope to avoid them; we can only grow wise about how to drain and manage them. Not all the days in our diaries will be ours to enjoy; substantial numbers of them will be lost to despair and confusion. There should be nothing unusual or too painful in the thought. We can take courage from the example of those who work on the banks of the River Cuckmere; we should live with floodplains in our minds.</p>
