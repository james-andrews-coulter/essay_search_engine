        <h4>6. Connecting</h4>
<p>Only connect.</p>
<p>(E. M. FORSTER, HOWARD’S END)</p>
<p>It’s surely clear that good relationship decisions are based on knowing far more about a partner than whether they simply tick the headline demands of our wish-list. To
  return to the ‘love funnel’ metaphor, the more we filter down our options to fewer possible partners, the more we need to aim for a broader and more extensive understanding of each
  one.</p>
<p>For there’s an addendum to the earlier-mentioned jam experiment. Repeats of the research suggest that the ‘shopping mentality’ problem is not only down to too much choice but
  to too little information. Increase our knowledge about each jam (that is, each partner) and choice becomes not only easier but also more accurate, more emotionally intelligent, more successful.
  So, as we recognize which partners may be right for us, we need to view them from different perspectives, to witness them in different situations, to learn about them and allow them to learn about
  us – in short, to connect. The slow-river approach again, but this time trawling the deeper waters.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the simple fact of meeting. Once upon a time, we knew we were smitten because our eyes met across a crowded room (or at the village well, or as we were tilling the
  fields). The natural, biologically driven ritual of partner choice is founded on real-life contact.</p>
<p>Yes, some historical courtships were pursued at a distance. Europe in the Middle Ages was awash with ambassadors journeying from royal court to royal court while bearing portraits of beautiful
  princesses in the hope of arranging advantageous marriages. But without meeting, such long-distance strategies often went horribly wrong: King Henry VIII of England failed to even consummate his
  marriage to fourth wife Anne of Cleves because when she arrived for the wedding, he realized that ‘she is nothing as fair as she hath been reported’.</p>
<p>To really connect with – and make a decision on – a partner, we need to see, to hear, to literally feel them. It was anthropologist David Givens who in 1978 mapped out for us the
  instinctive process of natural attraction. We glimpse a potential partner from afar, then engage by eye contact, then by talking, then touch, eventually getting close enough to smell, taste and, if
  the stars align, be sexual. At each stage we parallel our conscious appraisal by unconsciously rating the other’s physical appearance, the way they move and speak, their hormonal invitations.
  At this early stage, closer and closer contact filters partners, not only because of what they say and do, but also because of the way they say it and do it. (Those who make the cut are likely not
  only to attract us but to be attracted to us; if face-to-face connection leads to a ‘yes’, it’s likely to become a virtuous, circular reinforcing ‘yes’.)</p>
<p>Twenty-three days</p>
<p>Actually, we know all this. We intuitively trust face-to-face contact because we realize it gives us essential knowledge on which to base judgement. We are reluctant to develop
  a relationship before meeting someone, because we know that without face-to-face contact we can’t make a full assessment. Which is why when it comes to the distance dating of new technology
  we may be fascinated but we’re also wary; traditional partner choice follows a ‘meet–look–talk–touch’ model, while new technology follows the new pattern of
  ‘view–read–write–talk–meet–touch’, which leaves the really important bit to almost the very end.</p>
<p>Question: How can that work? Answer: It often doesn’t. We may find that, after crashing the internet with reciprocally enthusiastic emails for several weeks, when we finally get close to
  our online crush it’s loathing at first sight. Moreover, studies suggest that disappointment when face-to-face rises in direct proportion to how long we’ve been in other sorts of
  contact before meeting. In other words, whether our expectations are met depends almost entirely on how long we’ve been stacking up those expectations. The key number here, according to a
  recent study at the University of South Florida, is twenty-three days of email; after that, a suitor would have to be a deity-come-to-earth in order to measure up face-to-face.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that the site- and app-developers, having made their mark promoting a form of dating that was literally at a distance, are currently putting huge effort and budget into
  trying to reduce that distance and replicate the natural first step of crowded-room eye-catching. The current direction is not just for increased accessibility through profile pictures, audio and
  video, but for meet-ups, social evenings, dance classes and singles holidays, as well as apps that reveal which of those sitting in the same coffee bar are looking for love tonight. The litmus test
  will always be the ‘close enough to smell’ connection.</p>
<p>Distance benefits</p>
<p>That said, we’re wrong to be wholly wary of distance in a dating medium. For when it comes to thoughts and feelings, being apart can actually be more trustworthy and more
  revelatory. A study from Cornell University suggests we’re more likely to tell the truth in an email than in a voice conversation, because we know our words are literally down in black and
  white and can be checked. We’re also more likely to open up about significant thoughts and feelings online than face-to-face, because being less close to a prospective partner lowers the fear
  of rejection and leaves us more able to be authentic. The adrenalin rush that comes with the ping of ‘you’ve got mail’ stems not just from the potential of a new relationship but
  from the fact that the mail in question may contain deep emotional revelations – and the fact that we can respond in kind.</p>
<p>So here’s how to drive distance dating to best effect. Benefit from the larger numbers to spot possible candidates, but rather than staying with ‘winks’ or ‘likes’,
  move to email as quickly as possible. Then, at that email level, without getting over-demanding, dive below surface chat; ask serious questions, give serious answers, open up and let partners do
  the same. The deeper revelations will help gauge the deeper compatibility; if it’s there, move on to phoning and meeting – the gold standard of real life.</p>
<p>Proximity and chemistry</p>
<p>For contact makes everything tangible, not only physically but also emotionally. It adds in all the wonderful elements which circumvent our logical brain – there’s a
  reason why Eros is shown with an arrow of love which pierces straight to the heart. It’s almost a cliché, that total fixation of gaze and suspension of logical thought. Think Maria and
  Tony in West Side Story, stepping across the dance floor to touch each other. Think Marius and Cosette in Les Misérables, stopping in their tracks at the Luxembourg Gardens
  as their eyes meet for the first time.</p>
<p>This isn’t, contrary to what we might think, only about desire. It’s also that simple proximity matters hugely and biases hugely. Once there’s a basic attraction, the more time
  we spend close to someone, the more they will seem appealing, lovable, simply better. And the longer, more frequently, more regularly we spend time with them, the deeper the impact. A 1930s study
  of 5,000 American couples showed that 45 per cent of them had got together when living within a few blocks of each other, which – while not as surprising in the 1930s as it would be nowadays
  – is still remarkable.</p>
<p>A word here about ‘chemistry’, a factor so prized and persuasive that an entire online dating site is named after it. We’ve surely all experienced the sort of heartfelt mutual
  liking which leaves us feeling good about ourselves as well as about the other person. But it’s difficult to pin down – and research hasn’t shown – what exactly chemistry
  is, let alone what causes it. Basic biological urge? Complex psychological fit? And should we factor it into our choice strategy? Without chemistry most of us would hesitate to take things further
  with a partner, and many commentators feel its absence is a deal-breaker; the founder of eHarmony, Neil Clark Warren, states uncompromisingly that unless you feel the urge to kiss a prospective
  partner by the third date ‘you’re probably never going to feel it’. But other dating experts join with many traditional cultures in judging chemistry as no predictor of
  partnership success; perhaps the only thing that chemistry guarantees is chemistry. If so, then maybe instead of demanding it as a prerequisite for a relationship, we ought to be seeing it as a
  distracting delusion.</p>

<p>Decision-making strategies</p>
<p>Which is why – unromantic though it may seem – it’s good to add in some more measurable, more strategic, less instinctive criteria for judging. It’s a
  wise exercise, as first meeting evolves into regular contact, to ask yourself what evidence you use as you form your opinion. (It may help to consider here how you judge not only partners, but
  anyone close – friends, colleagues, even family.)</p>
<p>Do you reach conclusions about a person because of . . .</p>
<p>. . . how they look?</p>
<p>. . . what they say?</p>
<p>. . . what they actually do in practice as opposed to what they say?</p>
<p>. . . what their general reputation is?</p>
<p>. . . what the important people in your life think about them?</p>
<p>. . . how you feel emotionally when you are with them?</p>
<p>. . . how you feel emotionally when they are not there but you are thinking about them?</p>
<p>. . . your sexual contact, if any?</p>
<p>. . . what their friends and family are like?</p>
<p>. . . how they interact with their friends, family, colleagues?</p>
<p>. . . how they interact with your friends, family, colleagues?</p>
<p>. . . their previous life in general?</p>
<p>. . . their relationship track-record in particular?</p>
<p>. . . what your gut reaction tells you?</p>
<p>Try dividing the elements into those you would always check, and those you’d never bother with because they seem unlinked, irrelevant, impossible to judge. Next, put the
  list in chronological order, according to those checks you pay attention to first, those you usually leave for later, and those you never attend to. Are there any surprises there?</p>
<p>Then think back. How has this decision-making strategy of yours actually played out? If less than perfectly, how could you improve? Perhaps you could prioritize the elements that until now
  you’ve left until later. Perhaps you could place less reliance on some kinds of evidence and more on others. Perhaps you need to extend, to use a wider range of checks and balances so your
  decision-making’s more effective.</p>
<p>An interesting thought about initial moments: one of my early psychology tutors suggested that the first experience we have of a partner provides a snapshot of our entire future relationship,
  sets the scene, writes the script for later plot development. So, if in their initial meeting Mary finds herself listening to Tom hammer on about his ex, she could find that Tom’s past
  dominates their future relationship. If in their initial meeting Tom and Mary find themselves agreeing easily about where to go to eat, they’re likely to have a cooperative time ahead.</p>
<p>So have there been any first meetings that, in hindsight, should have told you to turn and flee? Have there been any first meetings that, in hindsight, you should have taken as the starting
  point for something important? No regrets – the past is over – but maybe such meetings can be a touchstone as you go forward.</p>
<p>Three elements</p>
<p>If face-to-face compatibility’s confirmed and what we want is a simple liaison, we need demand very little more than passion and opportunity. If we are seeking something
  deeper, the criteria are more complex; below the intensity and the delight, there’s a need for a deeper compatibility. As Joanne Woodward apparently said of her five-decade marriage to Paul
  Newman, ‘Sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades. But to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day . . . that’s a real treat.’ So, can we get – can we
  give – that kind of treat, whether through laughter or otherwise, with our partner?</p>
<p>If we can, we’re likely looking at connection across three elements: values, life goals and personality traits:</p>
<p>•   Values: what makes our existence most worthwhile: safety, excitement, social recognition, happiness, self-respect, status.</p>
<p>•   Life goals: the achievements we crave during a lifetime: career success, financial security, travel, adventure, marriage, children.</p>
<p>•   Personality: a combination of character and temperament: honesty, mental acuity, kindness, generosity, bravery, commitment to hard
          work.</p>
<p>There’s a numbers problem here. I’ve just enumerated a longish list of examples to cover all three elements, but I could have devoted an entire chapter (or indeed a
  whole book) to each. For, while a full tally of a partner’s hobbies is typically achievable on the fingers of one hand, the possible subcategories of these three deeper levels might number
  more than the hairs on one’s head. Far too many elements to keep count of, let alone keep in mind as a benchmark for partner choice. Better to explore these issues more broadly to reveal
  what’s really important.</p>
<p>Three questions</p>
<p>The next exercise lets you attempt this broader exploration. It has as its starting point a somewhat morbid topic, but it’s useful to help you reflect. Imagine you are on
  your deathbed. You are looking back on a good life. You’ve experienced what you were meant to experience, done what you were meant to do, are ending as you are meant to end. Now ask yourself
  these questions:</p>
<p>He wondered how long it would take his partner to join him at the summit, given that they’d set off in different directions to begin with.</p>
<p>1. What three values made your life most worthwhile? (Think benefits such as safety, happiness, etc.)</p>
<p>2. Which three goals have you achieved in your life that you are most satisfied with and proud of? (Think aims such as career success, adventure, etc.)</p>
<p>3. What three personality traits do you most want other people to praise you for when you have gone? (Think descriptors such as honesty, generosity, etc.)</p>
<p>Answer these three questions, get your nine answers, and you’ll have a top-line list of what is deeply important in your life and thus what needs to be deeply important
  to your partner in his or her life. If one of your key values is status, you’ll want a partner to rate that too. If your dream is to parent an entire football team of offspring, your ideal
  partner will be one who shares that goal – forgive the pun. If it matters to you to work hard, you’ll need a partner willing to pull all-nighters alongside you, or at the least give you
  a genuinely appreciative hug when you finally come to bed at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Proofs of love</p>
<p>Nine words are a great start, a good snapshot. Problem is, almost always we’ll choose words that – while meaningful – are also abstract, indefinite, lacking
  detail. Example: almost everyone who does this exercise mentions the word ‘love’. But what particular flavour of love is that – and what if it’s not to a prospective
  partner’s taste? What if our idea of ‘love’ consists of huge amounts of free time apart, and theirs is 24/7 gazing into each other’s eyes? What if we agree with St Paul that
  ‘love is patient, love is kind’, while our partner is more of the Woody Allen school of thought that says ‘love is suffering’.</p>
<p>Fanfares please for counsellor Gary Chapman’s bestselling book The Five Love Languages, which makes just this point. He suggests we each have our own vocabulary of ways we feel
  cared for, as does our beloved – but discrepancy between our respective visions creates relationship booby traps. Chapman’s list of five languages is as follows: words of affirmation,
  quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, physical touch – though there are surely more one could creatively add to the list. And it’s pretty clear where the traps might lie. If
  our partner’s top love-language is gifts and ours is words of affirmation, then however many delightful presents they bring home, we’ll still feel unappreciated if they don’t say
  those three little words. If our top criterion is quality time spent together, while our partner defines love as acts of service, then however many romantic weekends we surprise them with, they
  won’t be satisfied if we don’t occasionally take the rubbish out.</p>
<p>What are your proofs of love? Define them as concretely as you can. Then list just as concretely the ‘proofs’ of all your deathbed answers. What do you mean by ‘safety’
  – is that financial, practical or emotional? What are you thinking of when you talk about ‘career success’ – promotion, work satisfaction or appreciation from your team?
  What do you have in mind when you talk of ‘generosity’ – is that giving of your time, your money, your energy? Think through these deeper meanings so that, when the time’s
  right, you can explain them to a partner and teach them how to be good for you.</p>
<p>Sameness</p>
<p>It’s clear that we need a partner to accept, appreciate and approve of these elements of us. But do we need them to copy, to match exactly, to be a ‘bird of a
  feather’ that ‘flock[s] together’? Here we call on the insights of psychiatrist Hellmuth Kaiser, who in the 1940s, while watching identical twins ice-skate in perfect harmony,
  suddenly realized that the audience’s rapt fascination was due more to the synchronicity of the siblings than to their technical skill. We human beings like sameness. It makes us feel secure;
  babies even a few minutes old gurgle with glee when adults mirror their movements. It makes us feel validated; imitation is flattering, so strengthens our good feeling about ourselves.</p>
<p>This good feeling’s reciprocal, a virtuous circle; if we worship a partner because we’re alike, they’ll probably worship us back. Which is why most dating systems, from online
  to matchmaking, pair clients based on likeness. And certainly when it comes to values and life goals, this approach is quite correct. Pair with someone who’s taking the same track in life and
  we’ll be content; if we’re on opposite tracks we’ll either move apart at speed, or play tug-of-war. Love, as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry famously wrote, consists ‘not in
  two people looking at each other, but two people looking outwards in the same direction’.</p>
<p>With personality it’s slightly more complicated, the research is more contradictory and it’s possible opposites really do attract. Yes, same-personality partners may make good
  buddies. But there may not be enough spark for interest, let alone romance, not enough complementarity for day-to-day teamwork, let alone home-building, child-rearing and balancing all the spinning
  plates of a practical life together. As an example, in Little Women, Louisa May Alcott’s novel about girls growing up in Civil War America, Jo March makes a fast friend of Laurie,
  the boy next door. Their bond is close and strong, but when Laurie falls in love with Jo, she is sensible enough to realize that their similarly masculine attitudes and hot-tempered personalities
  mean they could never make a good match. Instead, she moves to New York and there meets academic Friedrich Bhaer, whose tender character complements rather than copies her own; under his guidance
  she fulfils her potential, while Laurie ends up equally happily married to more feminine, less tempestuous Amy March. The lesson Alcott offers us – and one which relationship-advice books
  have repeated down the ages – is that we should choose a mate with similar values and goals, but with a different personality.</p>
<p>That said, recent research from the University of Columbia suggests it’s more complex than that. Apparently a better answer is to ask a further question: What do individuals want? Those of
  us who feel good around similarity will thrive with a partner as like us as possible. Those of us energized around difference will thrive with a dissimilar mate. It’s not the dynamic itself
  – all variations can theoretically work – it’s our comfort level that dictates success.</p>
<p>What about the ‘men are from Mars, women are from Venus’ issue? We might wonder whether, if similarity is so very important, but X and Y chromosomes are so irreversibly unlike, all
  different-gender relationships are going to be fraught. Here’s the reassurance: men and women are actually very similar. Some psychologists even suggest there are only two built-in gender
  differences – verbal skill and aggression – while anything else is down to nurture not nature and therefore adaptable. So if a relationship ends unhappily we shouldn’t blame the
  gender difference, or point accusingly at ‘men’ or ‘women’. And if a relationship seems well advised, we shouldn’t worry that it’s all doomed just because our
  beloved is of a particular gender. To put it another way: ‘Men are from earth, women are from earth. Deal with it.’ (The original of that quote is claimed by at least a dozen people,
  but it was far too apposite to omit from this book just because its author can’t be identified!)</p>
<p>Disrobing</p>
<p>Values, life goals, personality. Given honest conversation, we can probably guestimate these three elements in the first few meetings with a potential partner and – as we
  should – bail out if there are reasons for doubt . . .</p>
<p>But real proof at this level takes a while, and it’s as important to talk as it is to listen. Revealing what matters to us, doing the things that fascinate us, exploring the past and
  planning the future together will over time remove more and more individual ‘veils’, and, along with that disrobing, our judgement of each other will become more and more accurate.
  Studies suggest that goals will become obvious first, values next, with personality revealed last of all. To slightly hasten the process, you might try raising the ‘deathbed questions’
  as a topic for mutual discussion; crassly posed, they may bring the conversation to a shuddering halt, but used at a stage where both partners are sufficiently at ease to go deeper, they’re
  exceedingly good for highlighting compatibilities.</p>
<p>‘Commitment is an act, not a word.’ – Jean-Paul Sartre</p>
<p>Embroidery</p>
<p>Speaking of veils, is it wise to ‘embroider’ them in the early going, perhaps omitting certain details and subtly altering others for effect? How should we present
  ourselves in order to attract a mate? Answer: don’t ‘present’, simply be. Of course it’s tempting to massage the headline figures – online, apparently women often
  lower their age and weight, while men increase their height and salary. And of course it’s courteous not to be so ‘open and honest’ that we spend the first few dates revealing
  intimate details of our most recent relationship-breakdown or the exact figures of our current financial crisis. But if we’re not at least factually truthful to begin with, and if we’re
  not emotionally truthful very soon after, we’re in grave danger of ending up with a partner who wants what we say we are, not what we actually are.</p>
<p>Which is why I’m no fan of dating systems such as The Rules, which advise a ‘play hard-to-get’ approach to partner choice. I have to admit to feeling faintly nauseated
  by a book which, as early as line nineteen of its introduction, promises a way of acting around a guy so he becomes ‘obsessed with you and wants to commit’ – surely patronizing to
  both genders. But my objections are not only ideological but also pragmatic – any suitor, male or female, who is only enthralled by the thrill of the ‘hard-to-get’ chase will
  likely lose interest once the hunt is over. Although being authentic may feel scary, the more authentic we can be – about what we believe, what we want, who we are – the more chance
  we’ll have of eventually meeting a suitable prince or princess, even if that also means that en route we drive off a lot of incompatible frogs.</p>
<p>What if, conversely, we wonder if a partner is being inauthentic? This isn’t so much about whether they are lying – if we suspect they are, we’re almost certainly right. But
  what if nerves are holding them back, or lack of self-confidence is making them hide true thoughts and feelings. Usually only time, trust and the opportunity for in-depth conversation will tell.
  But – though it isn’t under our control and shouldn’t be magicked up to order – an external drama or crisis will often make it clear, snapping us out of early courtship
  timidity, giving us a reason to step out and show who we really are, for bad or for good.</p>
<p>I am remembering one client whose turning point for leaving a boyfriend was when she was involved in an accident and he suggested she call a cab to take her to A &amp; E as he was ‘too
  tired’ to drive her there. More hopefully for one’s faith in human nature, I’m remembering another client who suffered a burglary; her partner’s absolute support, practical
  action and complete understanding of how traumatized she was sent her rightly over the edge into commitment. It was sad about the burglary, but for the relationship, it was a result.</p>
<p>Soothe then solve</p>
<p>The two stories above, highlighting two very different responses to the emotional needs of a partner, bring us neatly to another kind of connection. And if you’re reading
  this book in the hope of a single ‘top tip’, here it comes. Without this element in a relationship, all the compatibility in the world won’t keep us afloat; with it, all the
  alarms, excursions, dramas and crises won’t sink us. Professor Sue Johnson, on whose work this section of the book is based, even hints that every other single factor involved in partner
  choice may be irrelevant. Get this right and you’re sorted.</p>
<p>I’m talking about emotional responsiveness – a partner’s ability to pay loving attention to our emotional needs, and our ability to pay attention to theirs. Note the
  reciprocity. As well as needing to choose a partner who values our feelings, we need to choose a partner who motivates us to value theirs. However wonderful a suitor, if they don’t inspire us
  to respond, they’re the wrong choice.</p>
<p>We all have emotional needs. Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs – that triangle at whose base sit the human physical requirements for air, water, food, clothing, shelter and
  safety – has on its higher storeys the need for belonging, acceptance, security, respect, love. We generate much of this inside ourselves as we mature, but the meaning of John Donne’s
  cry that ‘no man is an island’ is that none of us can do the job alone. Knowing our partner will respond when we need them, knowing we’ll respond when they need us, is at the
  heart of the love bond.</p>
<p>So what is this responsiveness? Here’s a definition which you may find useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being able to notice, pay attention to, reflect on, soothe and express our own emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to notice, pay attention to, reflect on, soothe and respond to a partner’s emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to reflect on and discuss the interaction between 1 and 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to do all the above even when a partner can’t, won’t or doesn’t want to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice what’s missing: any mention of solutions. Solutions may be vital, but a partner’s unlikely to even hear them, let alone do anything with them, until emotions
  are being honoured. So first soothe. Only then, solve.</p>
<p>At home by the fire</p>
<p>Let’s look at this another way, not as a list but a story. One of my favourite books is Thomas Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd – where headstrong
  Bathsheba Everdene turns down a proposal from good-hearted employee Gabriel Oak. Instead she marries dashing Sergeant Troy and, when he abandons her, accepts the courtship of reserved neighbour
  William Boldwood. Just to be clear, while there’s tragedy, there are no absolute villains in this story. In their own way, everyone does their best.</p>
<p>But only one man – Oak – is worthy of Bathsheba. That’s not just because he supports her practically through his work on the farm, but also because he is the only one who can
  stand firm emotionally. Sergeant Troy’s passion seduces Bathsheba but his feelings are unreliable, while Boldwood is emotionally crippled. Only Oak is capable of empathic generosity; in
  Hardy’s words, ‘the [things] which affected Gabriel’s personal well-being were not the most absorbing and important in his eyes’. If you’ve read the novel,
  you’ll know the ending. If not, then take a clue from Gabriel’s proposal to Bathsheba – which at first she rejects as uninspiring, but later learns to treasure: ‘at home by
  the fire, whenever you look up there I shall be – and whenever I look up, there will be you.’</p>
<p>Emotional engagement</p>
<p>Which makes it all sound very simple. But this kind of maturity is a big ask. It means, as Gabriel Oak knows, being there for a partner over time and under all circumstances. It
  means staying calm even when sad, angry or anxious. It means staying engaged even when our partner is sad, angry or anxious and we are sorely tempted to tell them to get a grip. It means staying
  rock-solid even when our partner is firing negative emotions, with us as the target – as they will do from time to time in even in the most loving relationship. Easy? Not at all.</p>
<p>So are we warranted in making emotional responsiveness a benchmark for partner choice? So long as we give back, surely it’s entirely reasonable to expect a potential partner to deliver
  emotional support, entirely justifiable to walk away if they can’t or won’t. Science is on my side in this. A landmark fourteen-year study by Professor Ted Huston of the University of
  Texas at Austin suggests that where partners aren’t emotionally concerned about each other during courtship, then even if they decide to wed they’ll probably part in the end. If couples
  are consistently kind, warm, sympathetic and empathic from the start, they’re hugely more likely to stay the course. We not only can, but should, make emotional responsiveness a relationship
  deal-breaker.</p>
<p>Adam realized at once that this relationship was going to be emotionally demanding.</p>
<p>You may at this point be wondering about the widespread belief that such demands could never be made of those with the Y chromosome. So can men respond emotionally? The answer is absolutely yes.
  Any male wariness of emotion is not because men feel it less – physiologically they actually experience it more strongly, more painfully, hence the wariness. Men’s main handicap is
  conditioning; little boys are told not to cry, big boys are told to ‘be a man’, but what they’re rarely told is how to manage their emotions. But another study from the University
  of Texas suggests that when told empathy is attractive and that emotional responsiveness makes for good relationships, men are totally capable of stepping up. I know this first-hand. I have had as
  clients many men who fully take on board this particular relationship challenge, reach out to their partners and respond to their partners reaching out to them. These men are certainly brave
  – but they’re not unique. There are lots of them out there.</p>
<p>Proofs of responsiveness</p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, we needed to get very specific about values, goals and personality – thinking through what our definitions were, deciding what ‘proof’
  there might be that we can deliver what a partner might need and vice versa. In the same way, it’s good to get specific about emotional responsiveness – what we mean by it, how we would
  know it if we saw it – or we again risk a relationship minefield where what one partner wants is not what the other can give.</p>
<p>How to unearth your definition? One good way is to think of the last time you actively felt emotionally supported; what did people say and do (or not say and do) to bring you back into balance?
  As contrast, when did you last feel unsupported; what went on that left you disappointed and discouraged? What were the differences between those times that made such a difference in how you
  felt?</p>
<p>Can we tell if a potential partner is capable of responding? It’s unwise to even try to judge this in the early going, when heavy-duty emotional interaction is rarely appropriate, let
  alone needed. That said, the following are excellent signs, their absence worrying: if a suitor listens with concentration when we are speaking, reveals emotional awareness when they are speaking,
  and – a sneaky one, this – shows empathy to those in the vicinity, even though these people are clearly not the object of courtship attention. One of my friends married a woman who on
  their first date behaved well to a waiter when he accidentally spilled soup in her lap. Another friend instantly dumped a beau who was rude to a nervous server. On both occasions my verdict was:
  good choice.</p>
<p>Serious tests of this dimension will likely come when strong and uncomfortable emotions first bite – on occasions that might be as huge as a bereavement or as small as a hellish commute
  from work. A partner may be able to listen, comfort, sympathize and soothe – and we may accept that from them, or not. We may be able to listen, comfort, sympathize and soothe – and a
  partner may let us in, or not. We need to pay close attention, for it’s here that both sides will show their true colours. And it’s here we will find the answers to the two questions
  which Sue Johnson claims are most crucial to relationship success: ‘Can I be there for you? Can you be there for me?’</p>
<p>Paul and Linda</p>
<p>What if the answer to the first question – can I be there for you? – is actually ‘no’? If we don’t feel inspired to deliver emotionally to a
  partner, we need to ask ourselves why and then listen carefully to whatever reasons our minds and hearts give back. ‘Because I’m just not motivated enough with this person’ is
  extremely useful information, even though it probably signals an ending.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question – can you be there for me? – may be unclear. We may sense a partner’s willingness but the way they respond to our ‘bids’ for care
  may not be quite what we need – a loss of attention, a turn away, an unresponsive comment. Is this just cause for dismissal? If all other signs are good it’s surely unfair to call a
  halt without giving a partner at least a chance to step up. So perhaps we ask, clearly and without criticism, for the response we need when we’re emotional? Listening or cuddling. Asking
  questions or staying silent. Looking on the bright side or joining in the pessimism. Giving time alone or being willing to stay for a while. While we’re on the subject, we might even turn the
  conversation to asking what response a partner might need from us when they are distressed. Just so we know.</p>
<p>This depth of conversation may not be possible at once. And those few preceding paragraphs may seem more like advice on how to relate to a partner than advice on how to choose one. But a huge
  element of successful decision-making is finding out whether each partner is both able and motivated to actually learn what the other person needs and what the relationship may demand. If either of
  us can’t or won’t learn then, harsh as it may sound, there is no future. If we’re prepared to study, the future is shining bright.</p>
<p>Apparently when Paul McCartney and his first wife, Linda, married, they made a private vow: ‘I will never put you down’. To my mind, this didn’t only mean that they would never
  insult or disparage each other. It didn’t only mean that they would never betray or abandon each other. It meant that they would never stop being aware of each other’s feelings, never
  stop giving attention to each other’s needs, never fail to open up to each other, never fail to reply. Emotional responsiveness at its best.</p>
<p>Four tendencies</p>
<p>We come now to perhaps the most intricate of all issues by which we may assess relationship potential – how we relate, not just when one of us has an emotional need but
  when the connection between us threatens to fray.</p>
<p>Because all of us will inevitably, at some point in our relationship, feel insecure, even unloved. Where we differ is what we do with that. At the heart of understanding what we need in a
  partner is understanding just how we differ, and how that plays out.</p>
<p>For which insight, we thank psychologists John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth and their work on child development (which, for easier consumption, I’ve here simplified). Bowlby began, in the mid
  years of the twentieth century, with a simple but innovative idea: that for humans, life is insecure. This starts early. We lose trust when we are propelled at birth into a world that is totally
  unlike the safe and comforting womb we just left. We lose more trust when, however devoted our carers, they’re sometimes too distracted, busy or stressed to give us the attention we need.
  Yes, we survive, and largely we survive well. But underneath it all we’re still mistrustful, fearing that we won’t be loved and if we are that love will disappear – when such
  insecurity hits, we fall back on our own individual coping mechanisms, ‘attachment’ tendencies, as Bowlby called them.</p>
<p>Mary Ainsworth built on this theory with an in-depth study of seventy-six toddlers and their mothers, exploring more fully what these coping mechanisms might be. Mum and baby were shown into a
  room full of toys and with a research assistant on hand. Once toddler was happily playing, Mum left the room three times for three-minute intervals – during the last time the research
  assistant also left. Some little ones cried at first, then calmed, seeming ‘secure’ that Mum would come back. Some became ‘anxious’, and when Mum returned, clung on in case
  she went away again. Yet others protested by cutting off, ignoring Mum on her return, punishing her for her absence; Ainsworth called this ‘avoidant’ behaviour. Others got angry with
  Mum for leaving; I’m naming this tendency ‘attacking’. Four toddler reactions, four emotional strategies, four tendencies to behave a particular way when feeling insecure, unloved
  and wary that love might never return.</p>
<p>As adults . . .</p>
<p>A few decades on from Bowlby and Ainsworth’s work and we see a growing realization that these tendencies don’t just fade as a child grows up. As adults, we’re
  certainly more secure because we’re more in control of our world, but we also repeatedly learn – often through the route of heartbreak – that we can’t always trust that
  world to deliver. And we still harbour those four attachment tendencies, sometimes majoring in one, mostly doing mix-and-match to differing degrees. When we are ‘secure’, trusting in
  ourselves and others, we handle love situations with calmness and confidence – even if in the end a relationship dies. When ‘anxious’ we are worried by love, unsure of our
  competence and needing reassurance. As ‘avoidant’, we fight shy of emotional engagement, pull away if commitment looms. ‘Attacking’, we feel an inner frustration, perhaps
  creating conflict in order to connect.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, you’re right. We all have all these tendencies in different proportions. We may not manifest the more challenging ones except when we feel insecure or feel
  a relationship connection weakening – but they’re there in all of us. For that, no blame, no shame; attachment tendencies are the human condition.</p>
<p>Which of course is why so many characters in literature and film display them (aside, of course, from the ‘secure’ tendency, which is so mature and wise that it has zero dramatic
  potential). The other tendencies, however, provide endless raw material for compulsive characters and angst-driven plot. For ‘anxious’, see Bridget Jones’s romantic insecurity and
  her readiness to cling again and again to Daniel Cleaver even when he behaves badly (though thankfully, in the end, she sees the light and walks away). As an example of ‘avoidant’, we
  might turn to the butler Stevens who, in Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel The Remains of the Day, is so wary of the relationship that might develop if he showed his true feelings for
  housekeeper Miss Kenton that he fails to admit his love over a period of several decades. For ‘attacking’, we need look no further than Heathcliff and Catherine in Emily
  Brontë’s novel Wuthering Heights; while they think of themselves as one – ‘Whatever souls are made of, his and mine are the same’ – they are nevertheless
  endlessly intense with each other and Heathcliff in particular can often only express his love for Catherine through absolute rage.</p>
<p>These tendencies have had an undeserved bad press. As is clear from the last paragraph, particularly when they’re presented in art rather than real life, they’re often seen as being
  all downside, fault and weakness. ‘Secure’ is, rightly, viewed as the poster child for happy and mature relationships. But the other tendencies have their upsides too. Being anxious may
  mean we’re motivated to ride out a partnership storm, stay loyal, stay committed. Being avoidant may mean a certain emotional independence, the ability to give partners space. An attacking
  tendency can mean being comfortable with dissension, or being able to summon huge intensity and passion.</p>
<p>So, to what extent do you stay calm and serene, trusting in life and love to give you what you need? How far do you stay loyal – even though you also sometimes cling? How far do you
  maintain your emotional independence – albeit you may get accused of not caring? How far do you engage energetically – granted that you occasionally pick fights? How do you respond when
  you feel love sliding away from you? What, in short, are you going to bring to the partnership table when you feel less than fully connected?</p>
<p>Partner tendencies</p>
<p>And what will a partner bring to the table? Discovering that is never going to be as simple as gauging height and weight, values and life goals, or a capacity for emotional
  responsiveness. Crucially, attachment tendencies may not kick in at the start of a relationship because at that point we likely feel perfectly loved and perfectly secure. So how can we make at
  least a top-level guess on a beloved’s tendencies in time to make a reasoned decision?</p>
<p>Here’s a useful diagnostic. Sex. Sex is one of the arenas where a person is most themselves, and reveals that self most early and openly in a relationship. It is Sue Johnson who here again
  offers guidance. She suggests that sex which involves a healthy balance between physical pleasure and emotional bonding might be called ‘synchrony sex’ and reflects a secure tendency.
  Sex used largely for comfort and as a way to calm doubts or conflicts, which Johnson terms ‘solace sex’, suggests a tendency to be anxious. Sex that is self-focussed,
  performance-oriented, with little emotional openness, could be labelled ‘sealed off’ sex; it signals avoidant tendencies. I would add that energetic, forceful, ‘fight it all
  out’ passion is what one might call ‘squabble sex’ and might reflect an attacking tendency.</p>
<p>Again, these are tendencies, not types. All of us make love in all the above styles – with emotion, for reassurance, as self-gratification, to let out frustration – in fact my guess
  is that if you mixed all four together what you’d get would be sex labelled ‘normal’. But a noticeable preponderance of one type or the other can act as a Rorschach test,
  revealing who a potential partner is and what a potential partnership with them might be like.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry</p>
<p>What do attachment tendencies suggest for partner choice? Similarity can work. When both of us are anxious or attacking we’ll understand each other and thrive on our
  mutual need for security or strong engagement. When we’re both avoidant – that is, if we ever manage to get together in the first place – we may feel constant gratitude for the
  reciprocal freedom.</p>
<p>Dissimilarity can play well too. If we compensate for each other, some anxious dependency may strengthen the bond; a small amount of avoidant independence may stabilize interactions; a little
  attacking engagement may mean issues get put on the table and dealt with in healthy short order. (A good exercise, at this point, is not only to remember your own past relationships but also look
  at the ones you see around you, as acted out by friends, family or colleagues. Playing ‘spot the attachment tendency’ is not only good practice for understanding partners-to-be but also
  good fun.)</p>
<p>But do be wary of extremes. If we meet a partner who pushes for commitment on the first date, one who’s never had any relationships longer than a few weeks, or one who picks a fight within
  minutes of meeting, beware. We are facing respectively an off-the-scale anxious, off-the-scale avoidant and off-the-scale attacking personality. Unless we’re totally convinced we can handle
  it, we shouldn’t even try.</p>
<p>The more subtle, and often less easily spottable, combination from hell is when partners of different tendencies date but can’t accommodate. Initial attraction may be strong –
  contrast makes for interest – and when we’re safely in love there may be no trigger for attachment wobbles. But fast forward a little: inject any kind of stress or insecurity and the
  dynamic will make both sides crazy. Anxious plus avoidant means one of us clings, the other pulls away. Avoidant plus attacking means one of us runs, the other pushes to engage. Attacking plus
  anxious means one fights, the other fears. The result can be a Tom and Jerry cartoon-type chase, with A emotionally pursuing B round the room of the relationship. If you’ve ten years of
  commitment behind you by the time this sort of thing creeps in, it’s absolutely worth taking time, energy and counselling to resolve it. But if it’s happening a mere ten days or weeks
  into a new relationship, run for your life.</p>
<p>The ideal</p>
<p>The ideal here – and it is an ideal – is that mostly we are secure with each other and that at least one of us is secure most of the time. Yes, there’ll be
  bouts of wobble – but in terms of choosing a partner, what to look for is someone largely honest and direct, who communicates clearly and is not into game-playing. Someone who is aware of
  emotion, not afraid of intimacy and is open to the possibility of commitment. In other words, human, but largely sorted.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem. What I’ve just described can easily be experienced not as ideal but as boring. Remove the emotional roller-coaster tendencies of anxiety, avoidance and attack,
  and what’s left can feel all too calm. It’s easy to get confused and think that because someone isn’t any kind of a problem, they are no kind of a partner. I have had clients who
  in the same breath as describing their relationship as ‘the most secure I’ve had’, express doubts that it is ‘the real thing’; clients who, while reporting
  contentment, worry that what they’re experiencing is too effortless to be true love.</p>
<p>In fact, secure is good, contented is something to be glad about, and the occasional tempest is exhilarating but constant storms are exhausting. If in the past we have experienced a feeling of
  secure contentment with a partner but didn’t choose them, that was our loss. And if in the future we experience that kind of security in a relationship, then – assuming all other boxes
  are ticked – we should offer up heartfelt thanks and hang on for dear life.</p>
