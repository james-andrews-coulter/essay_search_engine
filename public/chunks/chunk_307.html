        <h3>8 Nature</h3>
<p>Pre-modern people lived in close proximity to nature; they knew how to recognise shepherd’s purse and make something edible out of pineapple weed. They could tell when sparrows showed up and what sounds short-eared owls make. They venerated nature as one might a deity. But moderns don’t tremble before the night sky or feel a need to give thanks to the rising sun. We have freed ourselves from our previous awe at natural phenomena; we are alive to the sublimity of technology rather than of waterfalls. The emblematic modern locale is the twenty-four-hour supermarket, brightly lit and teeming with the produce of the seven continents, proudly defying the barriers of geography and of the night. We will eat pomegranates from Jamaica and dates from the Sahel.</p>
