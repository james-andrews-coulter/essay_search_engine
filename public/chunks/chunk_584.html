        <h3>¶ Emotional Intelligence</h3>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is the quality that enables us to confront with patience, insight and imagination the many problems that we face in our affective relationship with ourselves and with others.</p>
<p>The term may sound odd. We are used to referring to intelligence as a general quality, without unpicking a particular variety that a person might possess; therefore, we do not tend to highlight the value of a distinctive sort of intelligence that currently does not enjoy the prestige it should.</p>
<p>Every sort of intelligence signals an ability to navigate well around a particular set of challenges: mathematical, linguistic, technical, commercial. When we say that someone is clever but has messed up their personal life, or that they have acquired a fortune but are restless and sad, or that they are powerful but intolerant and unimaginative, we are pointing to a deficit in what deserves to be called Emotional Intelligence.</p>
<p>In social life, we can feel the presence of Emotional Intelligence in a sensitivity to the moods of others and in a readiness to grasp the surprising things that may be going on for them beneath the surface. Emotional Intelligence recognises a role for interpretation and knows that a fiery outburst might be a disguised plea for help; that a political rant may be provoked by hunger; or that concealed within a forceful jolliness may be a sorrow that has been sentimentally disavowed.</p>
<p>In relation to ourselves, Emotional Intelligence shows up in a scepticism around our emotions, especially those of love, desire, anger, envy, anxiety and professional ambition. The Emotionally Intelligent refuse to trust their first impulses or the wisdom of their feelings. They know that hatred may mask love, that anger may be a cover for sadness, and that we are prone to huge and costly inaccuracies in whom we desire and what we seek.</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is also what distinguishes those who are crushed by failure from those who can greet the troubles of existence with a melancholy and at points darkly humorous resilience. The Emotionally Intelligent appreciate the role of well-handled pessimism within the overall economy of a good life.</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is not an inborn talent. It is the result of education – specifically in how to interpret ourselves, where our emotions arise from, how our childhoods influence us and how we might best navigate our fears and wishes. In the Utopia, it would be routine to be taught Emotional Intelligence from the youngest age, before we have the opportunity to make too many mistakes.</p>
<p>Our Technical Intelligence has led us to tame nature and conquer the planet. A wiser, saner future for the race will depend on our capacity to master and then seductively teach the rudiments of Emotional Intelligence – while there is still time.</p>
