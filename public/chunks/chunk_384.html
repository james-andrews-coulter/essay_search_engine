            <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>There are two important theoretical books about being alone: rather annoyingly they are both called Solitude. One is by Anthony Storr (Flamingo, 1988) and looks
  psychoanalytically at solitude, loneliness and creativity, and concludes there are other routes to fulfilment and psychic well-being than intimate relationships; creative work may satisfactorily
  replace these. (The book was originally titled ‘School for Genius’.) The other is by Philip Koch and is subtitled ‘a Philosophical Encounter’ (Open Court Publishing Co.,
  1994). Both are deeply affirmative and helpful.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous book about being alone is by Henry Thoreau. Thoreau (1817–1862) was a nineteenth-century American author, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax-resister,
  surveyor, historian and leading transcendentalist. In 1856 he published Walden, which is an account of the two years he spent living alone in a hut in a wood near Concord in Massachusetts.
  It has become a major classic, and together with Wordsworth’s ‘The Prelude’ – and much easier to read – it is the great book linking solitude and nature.</p>
<p>Isabel Colegate has written a lovely history of hermits called A Pelican in the Wilderness (Harper Collins, 2002). She defines ‘hermits’ in non-religious terms, but most of
  her subjects take a fairly extreme path of solitude. Peter France’s Hermits: insights of solitude (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1996) is more focused on prayer and spirituality, but is
  beautifully written and illuminating about what people have gained from being alone through the centuries.</p>
<p>Richard Byrd (1888–1957) was a US admiral, early aviation adventurer and explorer. His book Alone (Shearwater Books, 2003; originally published 1938) describes his time alone in
  Antarctica. This expedition was not altogether successful: a faulty stove leaked carbon monoxide into his hut and he became seriously ill. The attempts to rescue him take up a good deal of the
  book. However, before he got sick he wrote some of the most beautiful prose about the beauty and solitude he found there. It is an inspiring read.</p>
<p>The figures from the 2011 Census for the UK have now been published by the Office of National Statistics in various forms, both online and print. They make a fascinating background to many
  discussions, including those contained in this book. Here is a pie chart showing the numerical size of households:</p>
<p>Notice how large the segment of single-person households is. It is not odd to live alone. Pin this graph up somewhere visible and if you find the idea of ‘being
  alone’ alarming, look at it and take comfort from the knowledge that you will not be alone in being alone!</p>
<p>Quakers (more formally called the Society of Friends) are a religious denomination founded in the seventeenth century. They are famous for their commitment to pacifism, their refusal to take
  oaths, their radical stand on a wide variety of issues, their complete lack of a leadership structure and their ‘meetings for worship’, which are predominantly silent. There will be a
  Quaker Meeting near you, and if you are uncertain whether it is silence or solitude you are most in search of, you might well find some clues by attending one. You will be made welcome and not
  pressured to ‘join’.</p>
<p>Trappists are an order of Roman Catholic monks who live under a ‘reformed’ version of the Rule of St Benedict, which incorporates a great deal of silence. The monks communicate in a
  form of simplified sign language. Thomas Merton (1915–1968) was a Trappist and The Seven Storey Mountain (published in the UK as Elected Silence, Hollis &amp; Carter, 1949)
  describes the life of the monks. There are no Trappist monasteries in the UK, but there are various contemplative (more or less silent) orders, especially of women, and it is possible to visit many
  of them. Making a private visit, often called a ‘retreat’, is a very safe and structured way to experience being on your own, although surrounded by experts and well looked after. Most
  such communities welcome visitors; you do not have to be a Christian and will not be required to attend services. There is a comprehensive list of retreats available at www.retreats.org.uk.</p>
<p>My own A Book of Silence is published by Granta. Although, as I say, it is more about silence than about solitude per se, it is more or less impossible to write about one without
  writing about the other and it contains very full references to a great many books and individuals who have practised the two together.</p>
