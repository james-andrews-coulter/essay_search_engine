        <h2>SMALL IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>Much work seeks to have an impact on a large scale over an extended time period, involving hundreds and perhaps millions of players.</p>
<p>Given our fragility, we might be counseled away from vast and complex efforts. We need tasks that can leave us feeling, at the end of every day, as if we have made a small but notable difference in someone else’s life. Perhaps we have in a modest way improved their command of a language, or cleaned up their garden, or given them something nourishing to eat. We may not have pushed the boundaries of knowledge or be remembered in a thousand years, but we’ll have done something more substantial still: kept ourselves steady against enormous odds and made an honest contribution to the welfare of a few ailing fellow humans.</p>
<p>12 Pessimism</p>
<p>It may be hard to imagine that the word “pessimism” could have any role to play in mitigating the effects of mental illness. But that would be to underestimate the covert persecutory aspects of its opposite, optimism. The expectation that our life should be well, that we should be forever free of anxiety and despair, paranoia and loneliness, is both understandable in its ambition and confidence and yet quietly tormenting.</p>
<p>Those of us who have been visited by severe mental illness need to cling to darker counsel. We, members of a not insubstantial minority, have been stricken by a fragility that will not lightly ever leave us alone again and so we need to be ready henceforth always to greet life with particular care: grateful for whichever days go well, serene in the face of those that don’t, appreciative of the small gains we are capable of, and permanently vigilant as to the possibility of relapse. We have been denied the easy-going lives we would have loved to lead and should not add insult to injury by continuing to regret them. They should be mourned rather than lamented.</p>
<p>We should accept with grace that things are, naturally, not as we would wish them to be. We will have to hobble when we would have loved to gambol freely. We’ll need to be creative about exploring how life could be bearable in circumstances far less rosy than anyone would have wished. We will have to give up our pride: that is, our assurance in our own competence and automatic right to dignity. We have been humbled and ridiculed by our own minds.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should take steps to make ourselves at home in the darkness. We should willingly expose our reason to our worst, nastiest, and most invalid thoughts rather than let them steal up on us at a time of their choosing. We should practice thought exercises that strip our fears of their unexamined hold on us.</p>
<p>The anxious should defiantly accept that they can never eradicate certain risks but that these can be shouldered—and a habitable life made among the ruins. Our relationships may never go right, certain family members will always resent us, particular enemies will never come over to our side, we cannot correct mistakes in our career, there will invariably be doubters and outright sadists. But none of this should surprise us and we should not let undue innocence aggravate our mood. We should explore the unbudgeable sadness on sunny mornings, when our reasoning faculties are lively and calming, instead of letting matters unnerve us in 3 a.m. confrontations when we are too groggy and worn down to know what to answer our demons.</p>
<p>We should heed the fact that it has already been very bad and, if it were to be so again, we would cope as we have already done. We should take comfort from the thought that we have suffered what some would consider to be the worst scenario—we have actually gone “mad”—and yet we are still here, more or less coherent, still able to enjoy one or two things, still capable of gratitude and occasional appreciation. We should, simply on the basis of what we have survived, not be very scared of anything much at all again.</p>
<p>We must accept with grim cheer that it wasn’t to be our fate to belong to the mentally robust cohort. When the angels were distributing brains in the upper atmosphere, we were accorded one of the more sensitive, erratic, brilliant, tumultuous ones, which we will have to continue to watch like anxious nurses for the first signs of fracture till the day we die.</p>
<p>But the troubles we feel so personally are not in reality ours alone. We are a community of the ailing and the more we can discover and connect with its other fascinating, consoling members, the less our troubles will weigh on us as singular punishments. The mood of society as a whole may tend remorselessly toward cheeriness. We have access to a dark cheerfulness of our own, shared among fellow sufferers, who are equally resolute in meeting a fate they never asked for, do not deserve, but refuse to be cowed by.</p>
<p>13 Skepticism</p>
<p>Few things come more naturally to us than trust in our own minds: their first impressions, the feelings they summon up for us, their judgments about people and situations, their assessments of who we are, what we are worth and what the future may be like for us. It feels right and normal that we should accept, without hesitation or compunction, whatever response our minds put forward to our consciousness. Why would we go to the trouble and tedium of starting to doubt what we innately and automatically think and feel? We must surely be able to trust our very own thinking machines.</p>
<p>Yet at the core of recovery from mental illness is the continually bewildering realization that our minds are, at key moments, objectively extremely unreliable and illogical. And, to compound the problem, they give us no sign at all that they might be any such things. They insist on their reasonableness even while they are behaving in what we can only much later deduce, with great patience and effort, is a foolish, harmful, or demented way. We have a grave enemy and deceiver right between our ears.</p>
<p>For example, these minds will tell us with total sincerity that the future holds something entirely awful for us and will thereby ruin decades of our lives in paranoid obsessions and compulsive rituals. They will tell us with supreme confidence that we face grave danger by doing something that actually doesn’t imperil us at all, and might even bring us a chance to flourish. They will encourage us to sabotage relationships filled with love and possibility, driving willing partners from our arms. They will tell us to give up on hugely promising work projects for fear we’ll annoy someone and will inform us that there is grave danger in building up faith in ourselves.</p>
<p>Our brains cannot think straight because they are reasoning via experiences in the past that were anomalous, unfair, unrepresentative, and unreliable. These brains claim to know that we are useless because that is how we happened to be viewed by one or two caregivers when we were very small and our neural networks were being laid down. They have complete assurance that achieving success will be dangerous for us because it once was, for a little while, around a jealous and inadequate relative who died many years ago. These brains keep sabotaging our relationships because of one relationship that hurt us immensely when we were too young to know how to defend ourselves. Or they keep us in a subservient position vis-à-vis someone in the present because this was once the safest way to be, when we were under five.</p>
<p>Our flawed brains are fateful generalizers from their earliest moments. They take the raw material of our young lives and extrapolate universal theories from it which can destroy our chances of responding adequately to the diverse and novel conditions of adult reality.</p>
<p>Recovering mental health depends on doing something utterly counter-intuitive: doubting our first thoughts on pretty much all topics through an appreciation of our innate biases, how they are structured and where they come from. We should put a large distance between ourselves and any impulse that washes over us. Strong feelings—that we have found our ideal life partner after ten minutes, that we must leave a person immediately, that we are about to be destroyed, that everyone hates us, that disaster is upon us—should invariably be resisted, placed in a safe zone and inspected with the utmost rigor, calm, and skepticism. We should develop an ingrained suspicion of our greatest, most spontaneous certainties, asking a whole series of questions of them: Is it really true that they told me they hate me? Did they actually say they wanted to end the relationship? Is there real evidence that everything is over?</p>
<p>It’s a curious way to live, and a humbling one too, to have to pass our certainties through a constantly skeptical sieve and to demand that we sleep on conclusions and discuss them with a reliable friend before acting on them.</p>
<p>At given moments, especially when we are tired, we should realize that we are not capable of thinking correctly and should therefore stop thinking altogether rather than mangle our conclusions any further. We should hold on to the idea that when we are especially distressed and upset, we will have lost our hold on the fragile thread of reason.</p>
<p>There will be certain ideas that enter consciousness with which, politely, we should just refuse to engage—because we have done so too many times before and know they are futile and disconnected from anything real. There really is no point in thinking, for the millionth time, about how ugly we are, how bad we are, how guilty we are. These aren’t thoughts that have anything sensible to tell us about our lives today. With due respect to our minds, we’d be better off putting on some music, counting to a hundred or calling up a friend.</p>
<p>We’ll be on the road to recovery and sanity when we see that one way to be properly reasonable is to appreciate how much of the time we aren’t able to be so. We aren’t disrespecting ourselves; we’re properly honoring our complex histories and the congenitally flawed thinking patterns they have unwittingly led us to.</p>
