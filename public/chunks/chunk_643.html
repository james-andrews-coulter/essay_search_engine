        <h3>¶ Oral Sex</h3>
<p>Understanding the pleasure of oral sex is central to grasping why sex as a whole might be enjoyable – and why it sometimes inspires us to do what may, on the surface, be some fairly implausible things.</p>
<p>Sucking on another person’s genitalia is not, at a physical level, necessarily satisfying in and of itself. The reason why it tends to be experienced as so pleasurable is to be found at the psychological level: it can be ecstatic because it is bound up with the idea of extreme acceptance. Genitals are normally the most private part of ourselves, which we are careful to shield from others, for fear of being judged or of offending. Our mouths, by contrast, are highly visible and respectable elements, the gateway to language and of the expression of rational thought. For someone to allow our mouths to roam freely around their genitals is a supreme sign of having been given unusual access to their deeper selves. It is evidence of being intensely trusted and liked.</p>
<p>A lot about our erotic excitement is bound up with a longing for closeness. Even when we do ‘dirty’ things (anal play, watersports, BDSM, etc.), the satisfaction is at heart to do with finding someone who is willing to lower their defences and let us into the most guarded spaces of their being.</p>
<p>We are constantly drawn to the idea that sex is primarily about the body but, at its core, sex is a psychological phenomenon. It is the delighted meeting of two previously isolated minds, enacted with the help of limbs and organs performing calculatedly rule-breaking manoeuvres.</p>
<p>Oral sex is exciting first and foremost as a promise of an end to loneliness.</p>
