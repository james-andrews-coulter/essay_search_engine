<p>How to make the perfect home: drawing out an archetype.</p>
<p>A picture, and a word</p>
<p>We all know what home is, don’t we?</p>
<p>Ask a child to imagine a home, and they will always draw the same one. There will be a path leading from the garden gate to a front door flanked by square windows, the facade surmounted by a
  triangular pitched roof. Look on top, and there will probably be a chimney, complete with billowing smoke.</p>
<p>It’s a ubiquitous image that we all encounter as children, in story after story. It’s the cottage from which Little Red Riding Hood sets out to meet the wolf, or Jack to sell his cow
  for a handful of beans. It’s the house into which Goldilocks creeps to eat her porridge, or, made of gingerbread, that tempts Hansel and Gretel into the clutches of the witch. Go inside, the
  smoking chimney seems to tell us, and you’ll find old Mother Goose telling her stories by the fireside.</p>
<p>It’s a ubiquitous image for grownups too, repeated in the windows of estate agents, or along the streets of suburbs from the forest villages of Germany to the golf-course developments of
  Shenzen. It’s an image that haunts architects, developers and builders who return to it again and again as the default form of home.</p>
<p>It’s a simple building, detached from the world by a garden, guarded by four stout walls, sheltered under a roof, and warmed by a fire. It’s a place of stability and order,
  guaranteed by the symmetrical placement of doors and windows. It’s the sort of building we call a house.</p>
<p>In Mandarin, the character for it, pronounced ‘shè’ is even drawn like one: . In Italian, Portuguese or Spanish we might call such an image casa;
  maison in French, or Haus in German. It’s deceptively simple, both the drawing, and the word we use to name it. No wonder children can draw it so well. No wonder it gets
  everywhere.</p>
<p>But start using the word ‘home’ and things become more complicated. Homing pigeons fly back to the place from which they came. Sports teams play at home or away, in Britain
  there’s a Home Secretary, and in the United States there’s a department of Homeland Security. When the French want to say they’re at home they say chez nous; the German
  Heim, like ‘home’ itself, means something quite distinct from Haus. In Hindi, the word for house, grha, also means ‘family’, and, with an accented
  ‘a’, a domestic servant. The modern Greek word for house, spiti, is derived from the same root as the word ‘hospitality’. In Hungarian, they call home
  otthon: our place of origin. Home, these words seem to say, is where we come from, and where belong.</p>
<p>Pull apart the child’s drawing, and you’ll find a similarly knotty etymology. The house is the building from which we begin, and it’s been around for so long, and has evolved
  over so many centuries, that it’s hard to imagine where it might itself have begun.</p>
<p>The symmetrical facade is an invention of the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries – not coincidentally the age in which our modern conception of the theatre was
  born. It is, as the word implies, a mask, a theatre set, that disguises the messy reality of home behind an illusion of formal grandeur (go round the back of most houses, and you’ll find the
  symmetry has fallen away). It suggests that the well-run house has a role to play in the maintenance of public order as well as private domestic harmony.</p>
<p>That the house should have two floors is a notion not much older than the facade that masks them. Once upon a time, in Europe anyway, most people lived in single-storey buildings that contained
  only one room. It was only in the later Middle Ages that other ones began to appear. As late as the eighteenth century, few of these rooms were given specific functions; and it was not until the
  nineteenth century that the bedrooms retreated from the public spaces of the main floor to an upper level all of their own. If the symmetrical facade of the house tells a story about the public
  face of home, the multiplication of rooms inside tells the opposite tale, of home as a place of private refuge.</p>
<p>The chimney was one result of this development. When the house consisted only of one room, people would make do with a hole in the roof and a fire directly below on the floor; but once the house
  acquired more and smaller rooms on several levels, such a casual approach became impracticable. The fireplace and the chimney were newfangled machines, designed to divert the sooty smoke out of
  specific rooms, and up to the top of the roof.</p>
<p>And that leaves the roof itself. It is much older than anything else. In Britain, the longhouses of the Anglo Saxons were almost all roof, and so were the homesteads of the Celts and the Iron
  Age people that preceded them. The African Kraal is all roof, as are the thatched houses of the marsh people of southern Iraq. Their similarity is the result of a pragmatic strategy rather than
  cosmic coincidence. It’s much easier to make a triangular structure stand up than a rectangular one.</p>
<p>Take the words we use for home, take our child’s drawing, and take them to pieces. Strip away the symmetrical facade, knock the rooms together, lop off the top floor, take out the
  chimneys, and what do we have? An almost conical thatched hut, with a fire smoking in the middle of the floor. It might look nothing like your home, or mine, but it’s where they both
  began.</p>
<p>Hearth and home: origins</p>
<p>Even at the height of their empire, the Romans kept such a hut alongside the temples and palaces of the Forum to remind themselves of where they had come from. The thatch kept
  on burning down, of course, ignited by sparks from the open fire that burned in the middle of the floor, but they rebuilt it every time, just the same. They called it the Tugurium Romuli:
  the house of Romulus, the legendary founder of their city, and their first king.</p>
<p>And more than two thousand years ago, in his treatise on architecture, Vitruvius used the Tugurium Romuli to speculate on the origins of architecture itself. He lived in a world in
  which histories of ancient times were remembered in myths and legends rather than archives and records and so his was an imaginative reconstruction, told, like all those fairy-tale accounts of
  cottages in the German forest, as a story.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, he wrote, people lived like wild animals, wandering the wilderness. Then one day a lightning strike started a fire in the forest, and people started to gather together around
  it, in a circle, to warm their hands. Standing together, for the first time, in a single place, they started to talk to one another, and to share ideas about how they might settle down:</p>
<p>Some made them of green boughs, others dug caves on mountainsides, and some, in imitation of the nests of swallows and the way they built, made places of refuge out of mud
      and twigs. Next, by observing the shelters of others and adding new details to their own inceptions, they constructed better and better kinds of huts as time went on.1</p>
<p>The Tugurium Romuli, observed Vitruvius, was the last relic of those immemorial days; but it was also something else, for to speculate on origins, especially mythical
  ones, is also to speculate on essences. The essence of the home, Vitruvius’ story implied, lay not in the marbled halls and magnificent facades of his time, but in something simpler: a group
  of people warming themselves in the wilderness, standing and sitting around a fire, and talking to one another.</p>
<p>The Italians still have a special word for home: focolare. Search for the origins of this word, and you’ll find the Latin name for hearth, which is focus. ‘Hearth
  and home’ we say; and when we teach children how to draw a home, they cap it off with a chimney. More than a millennium after the last copy of the first house, the Tugurium Romuli,
  disappeared in an undocumented fire, it lives on, in a word, and a childish doodle.</p>
<p>Go west: homes for pioneers</p>
<p>Home is our focus, our point of origin; and wherever we are, and whoever we are, its own point of origin remains with us still. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright is
  credited with being one of the inventors of the modern house. He couldn’t, on the face of it, have been more different from the savages of Vitruvius’ ancient myth and their primitive
  huts.</p>
<p>Wright imagined his clients as pioneers, staking their claim to the leafy Chicago suburb of Oak Park with bricks and mortar, just as their predecessors had done to the prairie with their covered
  wagons; and he pioneered new houses for new people, people whose parents had run away from the old world to the new to make new lives for themselves, unencumbered by the weight of the past.</p>
<p>‘Prairie houses’, they were called, in reference to the wide empty spaces of the New World that stretched out in front of them; and with their daring cantilevers, their open-plan
  living spaces and their wide windows, they were places for pioneers who had left old-fashioned conventions behind them.</p>
<p>When Wright decided to build himself a home, he too struck out West: ‘a voluntary exile, into the uncharted and unknown’,2 and being a
  Midwesterner himself, he found himself, ironically, going home, to the hill in the valley in Wisconsin from which he had originally come. ‘[It] was one of my favourite places when I was a
  boy,’ he wrote, ‘for pasque flowers grew there in March sun while snow still streaked the hillsides.’3</p>
<p>Wright returned to his own place of origin; but for him it was a double returning. He called his house Taliesin, a Welsh name, in honour of the country from which his grandparents had sailed
  from the Old World to the New. Like an imagined America itself, the hill in the valley at Taliesin was wild and uninhabited; and Wright had no intention of disrupting its native beauty. He designed
  himself a house that ‘would belong to that hill, as trees and ledges of rock did; as grandfather and mother had belonged to it’.4 Taliesin
  was ‘a house of the north. The whole was low, wide and snug, a broad shelter seeking fellowship with its surroundings.’5 Sheltered under
  enormous roofs, anchored by heavy stone chimneys, literally rooted to the spot, Taliesin was everything that our child’s drawing strives to be. It was home.</p>
<p>A myth: the poetics of houses</p>
<p>For children and for grownups, for ancient Romans and modern Americans, images of house and home remind us of where we’ve come from, and of who, therefore, we think we
  are. What’s more, as we’ll see, home makes us who we are. If we want to understand one, we must also try to understand the other.</p>
<p>In The Poetics of Space, published in 1958, the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard made the point: ‘A house constitutes a body of images that give mankind proofs or illusions of
  stability’,6 and that, perhaps, is why that child’s drawing is so compelling: it represents somewhere and something that is, unlike the
  world beyond the garden gate, unchanging.</p>
<p>The Poetics of Space is ostensibly a rummage through a typical house, with a cellar, two floors for living in, and an attic; but it is also a meditation on how we use such a house to
  make ourselves a home in the wider world. ‘Our house,’ wrote Bachelard, ‘is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word.’7</p>
<p>And that cosmos is no abstract philosophical idea. ‘The house we were born in is physically inscribed in us,’ wrote Bachelard, as ‘a group of organic habits. After twenty
  years, in spite of all the other anonymous stairways, we would recapture the reflexes of the “first stairway”, we would not stumble on that rather high step . . . the feel of the
  tiniest latch has remained in our hands.’8</p>
<p>We imagine that buildings are passive objects made by human hands; but, Bachelard argues, in fact the very reverse happens. The way our hands (and by extension the rest of our bodies) feel their
  way around the spaces we live in is formed by the first space they ever touched, the building from which we begin: home. Like the Hungarian Otthon, or the Italian Focolare, home
  is our point of origin: the navel of the world we each grow to inhabit.</p>
<p>‘A great many of our memories are housed,’ wrote Bachelard, ‘and if the house is a bit elaborate, if it has a cellar and a garret, nooks and crannies, our memories have refuges
  that are all the more clearly delineated.’9 Try to imagine the house he is describing: it’s a slightly more elaborate, picturesque version
  of the child’s drawing we started with. One is tempted to think of some turreted nineteenth-century house in the provincial suburbs of northern France: the very sort of house in which
  Bachelard himself grew up.</p>
<p>But the form of this imaginary house was not just the result of autobiographical musing. Bachelard was something of an apostle of psychoanalysis, and his home was constructed as metaphor for the
  id, ego and superego and all the rest of it. ‘The conscious acts like a man,’ he quoted Jung as saying, ‘who hearing a suspicious noise in the cellar, hurries to the attic, and,
  finding no burglars there, decides, consequently, that the noise was pure imagination. In reality, this prudent man did not dare venture into the cellar.’10</p>
<p>And that lends a very particular structure to Bachelard’s imaginary house. In the middle is a ‘conscious’ region of the house – the ego – in which daily life is
  lived. It is framed by two other spaces: an attic above, cluttered with the desiccated memoriae of the superego; and a cellar below, whose damp and dark excite the unnameable terrors and
  insatiable desires of the id.</p>
<p>Home represents stability in an unstable world. Home is a metaphor for the self. Home is the storehouse of memory. Home is made by, and makes us, what we are. Home is where we can be ourselves.
  There’s nothing naive about that child’s drawing, with its brick box at the end of the garden path, with its triangular roof and its smoking chimney; and it’s not just a drawing
  of a building. It’s a drawing of who you think you are.</p>
<p>A reality: superimposed boxes</p>
<p>But like the farmyard noises with which urban children who’ve never seen a cow or heard a duck learn to speak, the archetype of the house they learn to draw (and which we
  dream of building as adults) is a rarity. Very few of us can afford to build ourselves a home that stands in a garden, as a building on its own, with two floors, and a roof, and a chimney.</p>
<p>How to make a home in the modern city: apartment living in contemporary Shanghai.</p>
<p>‘In Paris,’ wrote Bachelard, ‘there are no houses, and the inhabitants of the big city live in superimposed boxes.’ He didn’t approve: ‘The number of the
  street and the floor give the location of our conventional hole, but our abode has neither space around it nor verticality inside it.’11 That
  is to say, the mass-produced housing in which most of us live lacks the psychological breadth and depth of a detached house.</p>
<p>Your dream home might still be a house, detached from the world, sitting in a garden with a roof and a chimney; but it’s becoming increasingly unlikely that you or I will live in one. In
  2014, the World Health Organization noted that 54 per cent of humanity now live in cities. That is a figure that has grown by 20 per cent since 1960,12 and it is projected to keep on growing. Inside those cities individual houses are themselves increasingly rare. For example, London might once have been a city of terraced
  houses, but as property prices rise in relation to income those houses have been subdivided into flats, and new dwellings are built in shared blocks rather than as individual units. In much of the
  world, from the insulae of imperial Rome to the khiva villages of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, urbanites have been living in flats since ancient times.</p>
<p>Bachelard’s link between house, home and self might work for the forest-dwelling, hut-building savages of Vitruvius’ myth, or the tiny elite who can afford to commission a Frank
  Lloyd Wright to design and build them a Taliesin, but it’s not going to work for the rest of us. If you live in a flat, it’s unlikely that it was built with precisely you or me in mind.
  Most of us make ourselves at home in places which were never really designed for us in the first place.</p>
<p>But, somehow, making do, keeping what we must, changing what we can, we manage. We change what we find, and in doing so, make it our own.</p>
<p>Altered states: time and the architecture of home</p>
<p>Around the same time that Wright was dreaming up Taliesin, Adolf Loos, the author of our story about the rich man, decided to advertise a tour of the homes that he had designed
  in Vienna. He was working in the crowded, twilit capital of an ancient empire rather than on an empty prairie; and the homes he’d made were quite different to those that Wright had designed.
  They weren’t even much like the home he’d conjured up in his story.</p>
<p>At Herr T’s apartment on the second floor of 19 Wohllebengasse, on the corner with Alleegasse, was a smoking room lined with mahogany panelling, and an integrated sideboard ‘with
  many corners’13 to mask the crookedness of an existing party wall. He’d created Herr L’s dining room on the third floor of 13
  Opernring by knocking two rooms together.</p>
<p>‘The cross beam was clad with mahogany,’ Loos reported, ‘and, for the sake of symmetry, this cladding was repeated, thus creating a ceiling with wooden
  beams.’14 Herr S’s smoking room on the fifth floor of Elizabethstrasse was created by knocking together two rooms, too, and the junction
  between them was disguised with a fireplace. In Herr K’s apartments on the second floor of 13 Nibelungengasse, the old bathroom was converted into a new vestibule, and painted yellow and
  white.</p>
<p>Wright was a romantic who dreamed of every home as an individual work of art. The homes in Loos’s description, on the other hand, were all contingent affairs, cobbled together from party
  walls set at funny angles that had to be disguised with cleverly designed sideboards or fireplaces, or structural beams that must be clad in timber, or bathrooms that must be converted into
  vestibules.</p>
<p>Loos might have been an architect, but the homes he’d created weren’t really the product of architecture at all. They were acts of improvisation, alteration, and negotiation with
  what already exists. Loos’s genius lay not in inventing new buildings, but in taking existing, generic ones – the superimposed boxes of Bachelard’s disapproving description of
  Paris – and turning them, somehow, into individualized spaces created for individual people: into homes.</p>
<p>Deep time, deep home</p>
<p>If you’re reading this in the inner suburbs of London, or Paris, or New York, or Melbourne, Mumbai or Buenos Aires, then Loos’s apartments will sound familiar to
  you. It is likely that, like the tenements of the Vienna Ringstrasse, your home is older than you are, and that the people who designed it – and the people for whom it was designed, along
  with all their foibles and customs – are long gone. Not only was your home not designed for you, it probably wasn’t even designed for the society you live in.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the terraced or semi-detached houses of suburban London. They are ordinary enough and the majority of Londoners live in buildings like them, as do their counterparts in the
  inner suburbs of many other cities. Think of them as they are now, opened out to the garden at the back with a deck or a terrace, the front room knocked through to the room behind it to create a
  family room, heated, lit, connected to Wi-Fi, television and the sewage network.</p>
<p>And think of them a hundred years ago, when the garden was a drying green and the place for the outside lavatory (there wasn’t an inside one), the front room was a gloomy overstuffed
  museum of bric-a-brac kept for best, damp streamed down the windows and walls in the morning, and light flickered from smoky gas lamps. Visit the very house you live in today when it had just been
  built, and it would most probably seem utterly alien, if not uninhabitable.</p>
<p>And that’s just an ordinary house only a century old. Imagine living in an apartment building in Rome. The flats at the Via del Teatro Marcello were built as a public theatre in the time
  of Augustus, and those on the Salita del Grillo have been converted from a medieval castle, which was itself built on top of the ruins of ancient shopping centres. The apartment buildings of the
  Piazza Navona started out two thousand years ago as the seats of an ancient race track.</p>
<p>Give it enough time, and time makes a curious nonsense of building a home, since it proves that we can build our homes anywhere, and anyhow. Houses last longer than the life of any single person
  or any single style of life, and as a consequence, the correspondence between the form and the function of any home can only ever be temporary. The homes we make in them are ephemeral affairs that
  remind us that building a home often involves rebuilding somebody else’s.</p>
<p>So where does that leave Bachelard’s neat idea that the house and the self correspond with one another? What has happened to our child’s drawing?</p>
<p>The passage of time was something of which the psychoanalysts, like Carl Jung, who inspired Bachelard, were well aware; and when Jung argued that the self was like a house, he was keen to show
  that there was nothing eternal, or stable, about either of them. He described instead a model for both that was nothing like our neat little box of a house. The upper storey of his house
  of the self, he explained, was Victorian, built on an older, sixteenth-century foundation:</p>
<p>A careful examination of the masonry discloses the fact that it was reconstructed from a dwelling tower of the eleventh century. In the cellar we discover a Roman foundation
      wall, and under the cellar a filled-in cave, in the floor of which stone tools are found and remnants of glacial fauna in the layers below.15</p>
<p>Blackbirds and cuckoos</p>
<p>Both our concept of self and of the house possess many layers of reinvention and re-creation. They are entirely specific to our own presents, and rooted in pasts that are much older than we are.
  They survive by being passed from generation to generation, preserved and altered with every passing.</p>
<p>So making yourself at home isn’t as simple as building a building called a house. We often call homemaking ‘nesting’; but that old idea has to take a new turn. When you make
  yourself a home, you are not the blackbird building a nest of your own, customized to your every whim and foible. You are the cuckoo, who makes a speciality of occupying the nest that someone else
  has made, and altering it to suit your own needs. It’s something we all do, and, in turn, someone else will to do it to us, too.</p>
<p>When we make ourselves at home, we take an existing building – individual or mass-produced, new or old, permanent or temporary – and by hook or by crook, we find a way of living in
  it. As we shall discover, we do this by installing furniture, hoarding objects, painting the walls, or scrubbing the floor. All of these enterprises are acts of making home; but they aren’t
  acts of building a building: they are acts of altering one.</p>
<p>Whatever children draw – a house, a building, architecture – cannot, on its own, make a home. They are just the beginning.</p>
