        <h3>Retreat to a hut</h3>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of traditional Chinese culture is the dignified recognition that there might come a time when, for reasons eminently worthy of respect, we will need to leave town and go and live in a hut on a hillside somewhere far away.</p>
<p>In premodern China, it was well understood that politics and public life were a treacherous and unsteady business. Reputations could quickly be made and just as quickly unmade. Rumours might arbitrarily surround a person and render all further public service impossible. One was permanently at risk of falling foul of court factions, of the machinations of enemies, of economic cycles and of military defeats. To expect to lead a long life and not to fail was contrary to any intelligent or subtle understanding of how the universe worked. Good people could – and should – expect to fail, suddenly and definitively.</p>
<p>The question was what might happen next. Chinese culture did not see failure as the end of the story: they were as interested in its consequences as they were in those of success. They understood a need to limit the anxiety that might emerge from a rigidly meritocratic worldview – and the solution they arrived at was the concept of an honourable retreat to a hut. There was room in the Chinese imagination for what were known as yinshi (hidden men), yimin (disengaged people) and chushi (scholars-at-home). These were terms of great affection and esteem for people who had left imperial Beijing and other centres of power, who no longer occupied any prominent place in the social hierarchy, but who still retained a solid claim to honour and respect. These ‘disengaged’ people could go into the mountains, build themselves small dwellings and then devote themselves to the observation of nature, to the writing of poetry and to the contemplation of the great sacred Buddhist texts. There was understood to be nothing squalid or shameful about their materially modest lives. They had not failed because they were ‘bad’, but because the way the world was structured meant for constant ebbs and flows of power and influence.</p>
<p>In China’s Ming dynasty (1368–1644), government and politics became especially turbulent and prey to arbitrary reversals – and it was at this point in particular that Chinese poets and artists celebrated the idea of a retreat to a hut. In exquisite paintings by great artists like Xiang Shengmo (1597–1658) or Tang Yin (1470– 1524)(see overleaf), we find inviting depictions of rural lives – huts that seem to truly compensate for an alienation from the glamour of the city. In valleys shrouded in mist we see yinshi living in beautiful, small wooden houses, often near a stream or by a lake. There are birds overhead, neatly tended gardens and inside the huts, perhaps a scroll with a Buddhist inscription about the futility of all worldly goods or the necessary dissolution of the ego. The once-powerful official is dressed simply but elegantly, usually cross-legged, contemplating the sky or reading a book, fully reconciled to his new existence.</p>
<p>We have made it unbearably hard for ourselves to fail because we have – collectively – been so reluctant to imagine what dignified failure might look like. We quite literally don’t know what to do with the failures in our society. We have nowhere for them to go. We don’t give them hillsides and huts and Buddhist texts – we expect them to disappear and not spoil our success-oriented vistas.</p>
<p>The Ming Chinese, infinitely wiser in this regard, knew how to budget for failure from the outset. They gave failure a place in their art because they had accepted it as a legitimate occurrence in their lives.</p>
<p>When we fail, we may not need to live in an actual hut. It’s what the hut stands for that counts: the acceptance of a life that is simultaneously modest and secluded – as well as dignified and unworthy of contempt. Our hut might be on a hillside in southern Andalusia or in a valley in Sicily or a desert in northern Texas. Or it might just be a place in our minds – a place we can retreat to and enjoy peace without self-hatred.</p>
