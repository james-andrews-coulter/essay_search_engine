        <h2>Rightness vs. scepticism</h2>
<p>Romantic voters believe it is possible to understand a situation or issue so clearly that one can be sure of complete justice and rightness. Therefore, those who don’t agree don’t have to be listened to politely. They are evidently wrong – and can be silenced or sidelined as required.</p>
<p>Melancholic voters are extremely alert to the possibility of error in their own and others’ analyses of policy. They are, therefore, committed to hearing and tolerating dissenting views – in which they suspect a portion of the truth may always be lodged.</p>
