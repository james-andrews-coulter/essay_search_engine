        <h3>2The problem with our instinct for endorsement</h3>
<p>The Romantic script of love tells us that a true lover will and must understand us without us needing to speak. They will endorse our lonely, confused, hard-to-reach aspects just by intuition.</p>
<p>This is very touching, but a huge problem in the long-term. It dissuades us from the difficult but necessary task of explaining ourselves: what we want, how we feel, why we are sad, what irritates us. We start to believe that a good lover should simply know the contents of our minds without us doing anything to share them. The fact that they understood parts of our minds so well, and so naturally, at one particular point leads to the counterproductive feeling that they should therefore understand the whole of our minds at all times – breeding a marked reluctance to explain (it doesn’t feel very Romantic, we might say).</p>
<p>The background problem is that we are deeply complex creatures. Realistically, no human being will be able to feel their way intuitively into all areas of anyone else’s mind. This means that in many situations that are very important to us, and in which we’d ideally like wordless understanding, we will not find rapid or easy endorsement from the person our instincts lead us to. In many cases, our unformulated needs will simply be met with deep, blank incomprehension or irritating error.</p>
<p>One of the great dangers of our Instinct for Endorsement is that it leads, when frustrated, to an outbreak of sulking. Sulking is a highly distinctive phenomenon within the psychology of love. Crucially, we don’t sulk with just anyone. We reserve our sulks for people we believe should understand us but happen not to on a given occasion. We could explain what is wrong to them, of course, but if we did so, it would mean that they had failed to understand us intuitively and therefore that they were not worthy of love.</p>
<p>A sulk is one of the odder gifts of love. Our incensed background belief that a good lover should just know explains why on the evening when they unwittingly cause us offence at a party, we will sit quietly in the car on the way home and will reply with a simple ‘Nothing’ when they enquire if anything is up. When we get home, we’ll disappear straight into the bathroom and bolt the door – and when they ask again, ‘Please tell me what is wrong’, we’ll remain silent with our arms folded, for we implicitly believe that a true lover – someone really worthy of our affection – would be able to read our intentions through the bathroom panel, through our outer casing and into the caverns of our burnt and pained souls.</p>
