        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>We need to build compassion for ourselves. Try answering these questions:</p>
<p>•   How should we treat ourselves?</p>
<p>•   If we saw a friend treating themselves as we treat ourselves, what would we advise?</p>
<p>•   Looking forward, how might we dare to respond if someone one day decided we were really rather lovely?</p>
<p>•   Could we forgive someone who did not have contempt for us?</p>
<p>•   How might we overcome the nauseous feeling of realising that we were admired and adored?</p>
<p>The phrase ‘self-love’ misleads us when we imagine that searching for it would mean striving to acquire a conceited, pompous view of ourselves. True release from self-loathing tends to be a great deal more modest: we are only after a sane, fair and more accurate perspective on our ordinary earthly nature. We can, with kindness and good humour, accept that being silly is entirely normal; wasting opportunities is universal; average sexuality is to be expected. Self-love shouldn’t be predicated on the competitive idea that we must pull off extraordinary feats of courage or intelligence. True love is only ever the compassion of the fallen for the fallen; it’s the search by one radically imperfect being to express their tenderness at the sight of the struggles and pains of another. We should – henceforth – allow ourselves enough self-love to be able to endure a little kindness.</p>
