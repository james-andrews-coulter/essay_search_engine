        <h4>3. Looking Back</h4>
<p>Study the past if you would define the future.</p>
<p>(CONFUCIUS)</p>
<p>When we actively search for a long-term partner, most of us tend to think ahead. We map out goals. We create aims. And the more serious a partnership we want, the further ahead
  we tend to think – not just to meeting a new date, but to moving in, to getting wed, to which gender our first child will be. There’s wisdom in that. To choose well we have to gauge
  what the long-term will deliver.</p>
<p>But there’s wisdom too – as Confucius says – in first putting attention back to the past. How has it made us who we are? What does that mean for who we choose? It’s not
  only that our past partnerships have been preparation for this moment, giving us both ability and vulnerability around loving. It’s also that every event in our past – from the moment
  we were born, let alone from the moment we began to date – has taught us messages about partnership and partnership choice. Whom we choose may be our decision alone, but why we choose will be
  influenced by a whole lifetime’s cast of characters and scenes.</p>
<p>Your influences</p>
<p>It’s an interesting exercise to look back at our personal cast-list and our personal life-plot. Was it our mother, father or neither who taught us, by what they said or what they did,
  which kind of relationship we should aim for and which we should avoid? Was it our siblings, our friends, our teachers or our culture that told us we should choose a partner for their intelligence,
  their earning power, their beauty or their biddability? Was it being brought up in a conflict-ridden family or being a member of the debating society that has made us believe so completely that
  perfect partners either never argue or that, conversely, they regularly do? Is it our parents’ ruby wedding anniversary or our own recent relationship break-up that leaves us convinced either
  that love lasts for ever or that it is utterly impossible? And what role do Jane Eyre, James Bond, Fifty Shades of Grey or The Selfish Gene have in all this?</p>
<p>So review. Who have been your biggest influencers on how best to choose a partner? What has most shaped your thoughts and feelings about the kind of person who will be the best mate for you?</p>
<p>•   Parents, siblings, extended family</p>
<p>•   Religious or cultural leaders, teachers</p>
<p>•   Your peer group and their partners</p>
<p>•   Your past loves, requited or unrequited</p>
<p>•   The media, be that news, books, films, the internet, television</p>
<p>•   Traumatic events in your own life or the lives of those close to you</p>
<p>•   Positive, affirming events in your own life or the lives of those close to you</p>
<p>Now take this further. Consider what messages all of these have passed on to you. What definitions, expectations and presuppositions have you learned about the kind of
  relationship you should want, and so what kind of partner to pick? It may help to complete the following sentence: ‘I learnt from <strong><em>_ that the best relationship is </em></strong>_ and so I should
  choose a partner who ____’, and to complete that sentence at least ten times to get a range of differing messages. Then, see if there are any patterns, any surprises, any wake-up calls. Most
  crucially, how have these life lessons affected the partner choices you’ve made up to now?</p>
<p>Love maps</p>
<p>For more insight let’s turn to sexologist John Money, who calls these lessons ‘love maps’ – templates of how we see ideal partnership and how we see our
  ideal partner. Money suggests that we gain love maps instinctively and early – often between the ages of about five and eight – as if we’re picking up an accent in our native
  language. So we don’t question, perhaps hardly even notice, the internal image we’re building of relationships, the specifications we’re drawing up about the kind of partner we
  want – often down to race, height, build and manner. When we find someone fitting that map, we’re compelled. Yes, we may know on a logical level that an alternative mate may be just as
  good for us; but somehow this person just feels right.</p>
<p>Navigating one’s way through the highways and byways of the heart can take concentration, courage and an accurate road map.</p>
<p>Very often, the person feels right because they remind us of someone who felt right earlier in life or because we believe that with them we can reclaim the ‘right’ life events. One
  way of describing this would be ‘transference’; we ‘transfer’ affection from someone who was important to us in the past to someone important to us now – or to someone
  we want to be important to us in the future. A tone of voice, a sideways glance, a certain strength, a certain gentleness – all of a sudden, typically without knowing why, we feel we’re
  safe. No matter that we don’t know this person and they don’t know us; we feel inevitably drawn in.</p>
<p>It makes absolute sense to gravitate to the people most like the ones who have made us happy in life, and much of the time that’s a wonderful strategy. But get expectations confused, and
  it can go wrong. We can end up assuming a prospective partner will deliver the same kind of wonderful experiences that our parents (or our best school friend, or our very first ‘crush’)
  gave us. But partners don’t necessarily deliver, because they’re not that person and this isn’t the past – realizing this and accepting it is a key lesson of partner choice.
  Professor Sue Johnson tells how when she met her husband almost the first words he said to her were, ‘I am not going to live up to your expectations’. In the face of such insight how
  could she do anything other than marry the man?</p>
<p>Think back to when you were very young – say just starting school. Now identify three figures – perhaps parents, teachers, siblings – or events – successes, wins,
  triumphs – that at that period in your life made you feel deeply valid and loved. You’ll not only consciously look for a partner who holds out the promise of replicating those feelings
  but also be unconsciously drawn to any potential partner who holds out that promise. Good idea, with just one caveat. You may also be drawn to any partner you believe can deliver, even if
  they can’t. So try before you buy.</p>
<p>Bad experiences</p>
<p>There’s an added twist and it’s this. Sometimes we get drawn to partners not because they could give us something wonderful but because they could give us something
  terrible – in the hope that they may also give us the chance to overcome that terror. So we may choose someone who reminds us how withdrawn our father was or how dominating our mother was,
  someone who creates demanding situations that remind us of exam failure in school or the time we got made redundant from work. We find all this painful but familiar, troubling but known; we aim,
  this time, to resolve, to cope, to survive.</p>
<p>And it often comes good. Often, we get to turn things round, to cope with challenges in later life in a way we didn’t in earlier life because we are now older and wiser. And the fact that
  we cope not only gives us victory here and now, but helps to resolve the previous sense of failure. The Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai wrote that ‘people use each other as a healing for their
  pain’ – but in this case we are actively choosing each other for the pain, in hopes of getting the healing as part of the package.</p>
<p>Again, think back to your early life. Which people or events made you feel unloved or taught you hard lessons about what it means to relate to others? Do these memories link to your adult
  partners and the experiences you have had with them? What does that tell you about your partner-search strategies?</p>
<p>There is also, of course, the impact of life events so traumatic that they create a deep vulnerability in us, so we end wary, grief-stricken, furious or in some way simply too wounded to make
  good partnership decisions. We may be confused about what love means, unable to recognize it when it happens, unresourced to take it when offered or give it when needed. The obvious – and
  publicized – traumas are bullying, abuse and violence, but other seemingly less serious occurrences can wound us too. If our world rocks on its axis – perhaps from a house move, a
  hospital stay, an absent parent – we can end up thinking love will let us down. If as a child the only way we got any attention was when we were punished for bad behaviour, we may end up
  prone to tantrums in our relationships. The shock has not only broken our spirit, but dented our capacity to make good partner decisions.</p>
<p>Moving on</p>
<p>All the above works both ways. For our partners too the ‘past is prologue’, as Shakespeare wrote, and what happened in a partner’s life before the scenes they
  write with us affects not only who they are but also who they are when with us. Partners steer their course by their own love maps, make their own transferences, have their own stream of
  negative or traumatic characters and episodes from their own lives. So they may choose us because our ways of being wonderful remind them of wonderful people and events in their past, or because
  our ways of being difficult remind them of difficult people and events in their past. They too may need to align their expectations, to work through the difference between their hallucination and
  the reality that is us – and to cope when we deliver the pain that they unconsciously wanted to resolve through being with us. If a partner seems to be reacting in a way that says more about
  their history than about the present reality of our relationship, it’s worthwhile paying close attention.</p>
<p>It is not all bad news. Though it’s tempting to believe that everything that comes to us from the past is detrimental, it’s not so. Normal, kind, human love from those around us
  – whether given in childhood or in adulthood – not only provides us with solid ground for loving but goes a long way to redress any harm that comes our way. And while single intense
  experiences of betrayal can wound us, similar experiences of happiness, acceptance, success and security can emotionally vaccinate us against mistakes. For most of us, past bad experiences are not
  a car crash on the relationship road, but simply a bump on the way.</p>
<p>Plus, we don’t have to bring the past with us into the present. We can keep the bits that seem more helpful and most healthy; the others we can throw overboard. To which end, you may want
  to look back at all the lessons you’ve ever learned about love. Which messages are horribly outdated and need to be junked? Which are irrelevant to you now you’re a grown-up? Which
  messages are so idealistic or perfectionist that no one has the slightest chance of matching up to them, and by continuing to try to match up, you are simply feeding your guilt monkey? Which were
  taught to you by people whose experience is not yours, whose word you no longer believe, or whose life you have no intention of living? Which lessons did you learn through events that were so
  painful that you need to cull them from your memory bank?</p>
<p>We can cull. With new awareness we can unbelieve our past beliefs, let them go and take on board a new and more helpful set. And if we can’t do that alone, it’s entirely possible
  – and utterly wise – to get help; there is a wealth of knowledge and guidance to help us overcome relationship issues. So if you suspect that some events or people have left you
  vulnerable to wrong choices or misguided decisions, let me encourage – even beg – you to see a professional. We can’t change the life we’ve lived, but we can rethink it,
  understand it differently and so resolve the pain.</p>
<p>Confucius said that the past needs to be studied in order for us to define the future. Once studied, though, we may want to complete the lesson and move on.</p>
