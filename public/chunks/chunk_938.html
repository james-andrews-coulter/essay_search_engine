        <h3>3The problem with our instinct for familiarity</h3>
<p>a) The Repetition Dynamic</p>
<p>We are led by instinct to potential partners who feel familiar. In many ways, adult love is a search for a rediscovery of emotions first known in childhood. In order to prove attractive, the partner we pick must re-evoke many of the feelings we once had around parental figures.</p>
<p>However, parental figures may not merely be associated with tenderness and understanding; they may have mixed up their love with a host of problematic components. For example, they might have been depressed, unreliable, humiliating or chaotic. These qualities may now be the very things we need to find present in someone before we can experience ourselves as ‘in love’ with them. We may reject candidates without particular flaws and not even know why, simply saying that they are ‘too nice’ or ‘a bit boring’. These are code terms for: ‘unlikely to bring me the sort of problems that feel necessary in their familiarity’; or ‘unable to make me suffer in the ways I need to in order to love’.</p>
<p>We might go so far as to say that we don’t primarily want to be happy with the partner we choose. We want a partner to feel familiar – and this may mean that we are driven to seek out unhappy circumstances, if the affection we knew as children was connected with certain sorts of pain.</p>
<p>Following patterns laid down in childhood, we might say: I feel I’m in a close relationship when the other person bosses me about a lot, doesn’t pay me much attention and tends to withhold affection, gets irritated by minor things I do or don’t do, feels intellectually superior to me and lets me know it, or makes me feel furtive and ashamed about my body.</p>
<p>The Repetition Dynamic is what we call the odd tendency in relationships where we repeatedly go for partners with a very flawed nature who don’t allow us to flourish or find happiness. This tendency is very hard to see in oneself but far easier to spot in others. It seems like a mistake, but it’s far more intentional than this. At an unconscious level, we have no option but to follow a path of unhappy love laid down in childhood.</p>
<p>There is no blame here. Many people who cared for us had problematic aspects that they didn’t choose. If they caused us trouble, it wasn’t because they meant to. Still, we have to deal with the legacy.</p>
<p>b) The Recoil Dynamic</p>
<p>Challenging past experiences can also shape our relationship instincts in a very different way. Instead of being drawn to an adult who reminds us of a parent, our instincts may turn emphatically in the opposite direction. Something in our younger experience was so difficult that any sign of similarity between a parent and a prospective partner becomes deeply off-putting. We call this the Recoil Dynamic.</p>
<p>The reason why this can turn into a problem is that almost all parents have good as well as bad sides. When we suffer from the Recoil Dynamic, we may want to escape the bad but, along the way, can end up developing allergies to a lot of what was good. Maybe a parent was deeply creative, but had an appalling temper: now we can’t stomach anyone creative. Maybe a parent was very clever, but humiliating: now we can’t stomach anyone clever. Maybe a parent was good at business, but emotionally cold: now we can’t stomach anyone who succeeds in commerce.</p>
<p>We may therefore have no internal option but to end up with people who are without qualities that would actually have benefited us, that would have nurtured us and with which we are by nature in sympathy. Our friends can find this puzzling. They may ask how someone so creative – and whose mother was too – could be with a partner like that. Or how someone from such an economically competent family could have ended up with this kind of layabout. In such circumstances, we should look for telltale evidence of the Recoil Dynamic.</p>
