        <h2>Preparations for Love</h2>
<p>One of the alluring but terrible deceptions our societies try to sell us is that the predominant challenge of love lies in finding ‘the right person’. Once we have – after a long chase and many auditions – discovered this elusive character, we will apparently then be able to relax our efforts and settle into long-term contentment.</p>
<p>On the back of this idea, we have collectively built an industrial-scale economy focused on ways of bringing people together. This is billed as ‘finding love’, but really all it provides us with is the opportunity to meet someone – while the vastly more complex and challenging task of knowing how to love them continues to go unaddressed.</p>
<p>Yet the reality is that, however many enticing people we are connected up with, we will have little chance of building a successful relationship with them unless we have first mastered the psychological virtues required to sustain affection. There is no point in ‘dating’ until we have understood the nature of loving.</p>
<p>Even before anyone enters our lives, there is therefore value in developing our capacity to love – and in honing our understanding of the five skills essential to its flourishing.</p>
