        <h2>18 Nature</h2>
<p>The modern age has manhandled nature like none before it. Previous eras may not have treated it with too much respect — the ancient Greeks stripped most of their coastline of trees by late Antiquity, and the Romans deforested large chunks of North Africa and killed off all its larger wildlife for food and gladiatorial fights (the Roman historian Pliny lamented how the nobility had destroyed Africa’s elephants to feed their appetite for ivory bedsteads) — but the old world lacked the new one’s sheer relentlessness, as well as its power saws, dynamite, pesticides, guns and processing plants. As the railways cut through the American continent, nature was hacked down with unsurpassed thoroughness. There had been twenty-five million bison in North America in the sixteenth century; there were fewer than a hundred by the nineteenth century. There had once been a billion trees across the continent; by 1900, eighty-five per cent were gone.</p>

<p>Across modernising countries, people knew something important was being lost and many urgent attempts were made to slow the extinctions. The Yosemite Valley was protected by Abraham Lincoln in 1864; Congress established Yellowstone National Park in 1872; President Wilson created the National Park Service in 1916. In England, the Lake District was protected by legal force in the late nineteenth century; in Australia, the Royal National Park was established in 1879; Switzerland created the first European National Park in 1914. On a smaller scale, modern cities created free parks for their inhabitants: Munich’s Englischer Garten was founded in 1789, London’s Victoria Park in 1845, Chicago’s Lincoln Park in 1865, and New York’s Central Park in 1876.</p>

<p>When trying to justify why nature might be so important, there was always one answer put forward by promoters of national and urban parks: industrial society, with its factories, crowded streets and tightly packed tenement blocks, made it imperative for people to have a chance to get out into nature for fresh air and exercise. Trees and habitats had to be preserved so that we could keep fit. Though self-evident, something else — less often mentioned and harder to put a finger on — was also at stake: the idea that nature might be necessary for what a few voices still dared to call our ‘souls’, and others more plainly our psyches. It seemed that nature was as important for treating the psychological ills bred by modernity as it was for addressing its physical ones. Modernity had made us mentally unwell — and nature held some of the cures. What, then, might the therapeutic benefits be? At least five themes suggested themselves.</p>
