        <h2>II: THE DOMESTIC ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>There is a kind of fight that repeatedly occurs when two lovers are convinced that what is at stake is far too petty and small to have an argument about.</p>
<p>No well-educated, intelligent, enlightened soul would, it is assumed, spend any time in conflictual discussion with their partner about what to do with a wet towel, where dirty socks should go, how to cut a loaf of bread or how many cotton buds to order online. These themes belong to squalid, old-fashioned lives mired in the humdrum and the mediocre. Lengthy discussion might be allowed when it comes to themes of metaphysical importance – the direction of the state, the role of the free market, the rightful place of religion – but only fools would bother to discuss when and how the fridge should be cleaned.</p>
<p>None of this makes conflict over domestic issues less likely. It just means that when conflict does occur, it is handled impatiently, with a certainty that it shouldn’t be occurring and a determination to end it as soon as possible. Unconvinced of the legitimacy of our domestic disagreements, we end up bullying and nagging on the one side, and shirking and waving away complaints on the other. One person gives up teaching in order to insist and assert; the other gives up listening in order to abscond and evade.</p>
<p>Successful discussion relies on a sense that there is something profound to be processed. But in our squeamishness about the tensions of domesticity, we refuse to take our complaints seriously, and so our arguments end up scrappy, lazy and oblique.</p>
<p>A more fruitful course would be to recognise that the deepest themes can flow beneath so-called trivial externals. A dispute about the laundry isn’t really about sheets and clothes; a heated exchange about fizzy or still water isn’t really about cost. The ostensible focus of the argument (the butter, the bins, the umbrella) is a symbol. It stands for something larger and more profound, which is currently out of sight but is making its powerful presence felt in an indirect way.</p>
<p>We should imagine that there might be an unexpectedly large fear connected to things that agitate us domestically, and accept the initially implausible notion that what is making our exchanges vicious is that we are scared. For one person, haunted by a fear of excessive compliance, being asked to do the laundry first thing on a Saturday may symbolise a life wasted through drudgery. But to another individual who has had too much experience of disintegration, it might stand for a heroic victory over the forces of chaos. An ostensibly trivial fight about washing underwear can be more accurately reframed as a poignant battle against two competing terrors.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that we are rarely imaginative enough to discuss the psychological themes that stir beneath the domestic, and so we concentrate our disputatious energies on the surface points of contention instead.</p>
<p>We should learn not just to nag and shirk around the ‘small’ flashpoints, but to become forensic and generous investigators of our annoyances: to ask ourselves why we are triggered by a discussion of the shopping, what a dirty towel represents or what the symbolic meaning of crumbs on a table might be, given our emotional histories. Accessing our fears and seeing how profound and all-encompassing they can be offers us relief from the fear of pettiness; our agitation isn’t surprising, because genuinely significant issues are at stake. We can come to see the domestic sphere for what it really is: a superficially trivial arena in which we meet, in disguised form, the most important themes of psychology – the tension between the longing for freedom and the fear of entrapment, the horror of constraint and the desire for protection, the risks of rigidity and the anxiety of chaos – themes that deserve all the sympathetic and intelligent discussion we can muster.</p>
