        <h2>The Museum</h2>
<p>It’s late at night, when the tourists are gone and the repair work and rehanging begins, that the underlying strangeness of museums comes to the fore. Most of the time, we have little option but to passively agree to the value and importance of what we are shown and to walk obediently around the exhibits, guidebook in hand. But in the silent hours, we can dare to ask a few larger questions. We may note that a lot of what is now displayed in the pristine galleries once resided in chapels and churches whose walls were abruptly denuded by art dealers flush with dollars in the late 19th century. The pictures were made by artists who, above anything else, were driven by their faith. They didn’t care in any isolated way about the beauty of what they were fashioning; they wished for the delicate flowers on the dresses of their divinities and the golden halos over the heads of saints to assist believers in acts of worship. They weren’t simply making art to be looked at as part of a history lesson they wanted it to heal souls. For them, it had a therapeutic function; it was a tool. The Madonna needed to look down with infinitely kind eyes in order to lend her tenderness and understanding to the sad and the lonely. St Peter had to look statuesque and wise so as to convey his encouragement to those ready to give up or act immorally. St Francis had to help us to surrender our envy and hard-heartedness so that the world could grow more pure. These were objects in front of which we were meant to fall down on our knees and beg. To those entrusted with the works today, and who feel that they love them most, such behaviour would seem close to insanity; a security guard could be counted upon to usher out a beseeching pilgrim at great speed. We are meant to know about art, not use it to cry with. But we have bought our soberness and disengagement around art at high cost. Our art is no longer able as it once was to console us and lend us a new perspective at our moments of difficulty. We have not found a way for culture to replace scripture; our museums are our new cathedrals only in terms of their scale and cost rather than the sincerity of their missions. And yet, if only we allowed it to, art could still play a role in our healing. It remains a resource for our emotional evolution. The Madonnas still offer us their grace; there is still hope and courage in landscapes and portraits; there is guidance on offer in small studies of flowers or in abstract canvases of swirling blues and greens. Art remains a form of therapy, but we have not allowed the museum to present it to us as such, and thereby we deny it the central place in our hearts that we have accorded it in our public pronouncements. Our contemporary difficulty explaining what art might ultimately be for explains the forlorn look of the sacred works on the gallery walls; they have been transplanted into an alien realm which, while it accords them perfect degrees of humidity, disregards their essential original purpose and intent. We need museums to help us get better; we should remember to ask of them much the same as we once knew to ask of a basilica or a devotional chapel.</p>
