        <h2>11. WHY DO I CONTINUE TO FEEL SO STUCK?</h2>
<p>This is for those among us who continue to feel secretly stuck. We may feel very drawn to staying, occasionally tempted to leave, and unable to resolve the dilemma one way or the other. We alternate between periods in which we manage to convince ourselves that it might, after all, be bearable, and recurring crises when we acknowledge that we are – by remaining – well on the way to ruining the one life we will ever be granted. Torn between intense shame and untenable claustrophobia, weak in the face of our conundrum, we may start to fantasise that someone or something else – a parent, the government, a war, an illness, a divine command – might magically resolve the problem for us; like desperate children, we hope against hope that something might just show up.</p>
<p>But because it behoves everyone eventually – and with nothing unkind being meant by this – to try to become an adult (that is, a person who can alter their circumstances through their own agency) we may benefit from a few ideas to strengthen our resolve.</p>
<p>For a start, we are here not because we are evil, fickle or unlucky, but because we probably had a challenging childhood. This could sound like an odd idea to bring up, but the matter does appear evident in structure, however impossible the repercussions can feel in practice. Anyone can end up in an unhappy relationship. But those who get badly stuck in them, those who cannot find the courage to have a difficult conversation and move on, those who spend years feeling intensely ashamed of what they want and doubting their right to aim for anything more satisfying, these creatures are a particular subcategory of humans.</p>
<p>They are the ones who, when they were little, probably never learnt the art of confident selfassertion; they are liable to be creatures who never felt they had much right to tell others what they needed and to stick up for their vision of contentment, whatever the short-term troubles that might ensue. We, the stuck ones, were the good children, the under-loved ones, the ones who were scared of angry parents or overly anxious about fragile ones. We are the ones who, too early on, learnt to comply and obey, to worry about everyone else, to fit in and to smile. Now, decades later, we are the ones who cannot get up and leave because we would, at some level, rather die than make a fuss.</p>
<p>But however appealing that can sound, there’s a small part of us that won’t let us die like this; a part of us that awkwardly refuses to shut up and be stifled; a healthy part of us that won’t let us continue without the kind of love we crave; a part of us that is like a germinating seed with strength enough to move aside a one-tonne concrete slab in order to reach the light.</p>
<p>We endlessly question the legitimacy of our aspirations. Is it fair to want what we want? Is it normal to seek whatever it is that’s currently missing: more love, more intellectual stimulation, more friendship, more sex, more solemnity, more laughs? We would, in a way, love someone to tell us that we were plainly wrong. But the reality is that there can never be an objective measure in these matters. We want what we want and no amount of arguing with ourselves can make our appetites go away or delegitimise our needs. The way forward is not to call ourselves difficult and shut up but to learn to honour and adroitly defend our own inner complexity.</p>
<p>Stuck people are agonised to the point of paralysis by the prospect of causing difficulties; they possibly already have a lot of hesitation about asking strangers where the bathroom is. So now they worry whether their partner would ever recover, what friends would say, or how the family would deal with it. The last thing that occurs to them is how much, in the end, everyone copes. The frightening yet liberating truth is how little anyone actually cares. Even the hurt lover will recover and come to appreciate the benefits of freedom as opposed to enduring a constant emotional tourniquet around their heart. An orderly life is a fine and beautiful thing, but it can only ever be so when it sits on top of a flourishing relationship, rather than when it is fostered as a substitute for one. Better to blow up a home than to continue in one unworthy of the name.</p>
<p>The way to start getting unstuck is via a strangesounding move: by valuing ourselves more. We must accept that the point of a relationship is not to suffer, that some things are necessary but fewer than we think – and that no one will congratulate us on our deathbeds for having thrown away our lives. We are not suffering because we need to, but because we have grown up to be people for whom suffering feels horribly and compellingly familiar. We may need to take the entirely unknown step of telling the world what we truly want.</p>
