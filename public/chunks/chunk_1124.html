        <h2>Illinois Centre</h2>
<p>It’s common to think of the office as the place where we, sadly, cannot be ourselves. Here we have to wear formal clothes; we have to put things very carefully to others; we have to watch everything we say. Whereas home is, by delightful contrast, the place where we can let our true selves emerge. Here we can speak our minds; here we can lounge as we need to: here we can shout what we please.
It sounds in theory as if the advantage must lie solely at home. But we may reach a stage when, privately, we come to a rather different conclusion, and look forward to the office precisely because this place doesn’t allow people to be ‘themselves’ without inhibition. We may acquire reverence for the rules of professional decorum that stop people uttering whatever they happen to be thinking, that inhibit us from sharing every whim and fancy, that force us to be circumspect, respectful and diffident. A place that allows people to be themselves can, in reality, turn into its own small version of hell.
As we cross the threshold of the gigantic corporation and put on our lanyard, we assume a professional manner which, while it isn’t the deepest truth about us, is nevertheless a far more liveable version of who we are, both for others and for ourselves, than the untrammelled sincere one we are at home. Our office personas are tight-lipped about most of their agonies and longings; they don’t let on about their envy and their lusts, their irritation and their sense of failure. They have no time for idle speculation on what might have been or regret over paths not chosen. They have no opportunity to worry about the long term or speculate on what strangers might be saying. They try to be helpful. They don’t assume that other people will immediately know what they mean without having been told. They make an effort to teach. They’ll induct novices carefully into their wishes.
They won’t simply bang the table like a tinpot ruler and shout, ‘Because | say so!’ When they are feeling hard done by, they won’t pick on the nearest person and throw their bad mood over them like slurry. They won’t grunt. They’ll try to make sense. They’ll force themselves to be civilised. It may be fake but that might, at points, be a very fine thing to be.
We’re used to thinking of the office as the hard bit of life: here we come to work out how to ship lumber from Riga to Singapore, or to amortise loans from a pension scheme, or to settle rules on the use of acrylamide in potato crisp manufacture. It sounds complicated and it has its quirks, but over time, we’re likely to realise that this is the simple part. What child’s play financial engineering or company law are next to the infinitely more daunting tasks of trying to get someone to understand the way we need to be loved, or convincing a 14-yearold that we are, firmly, on their side. These are the truly nightmarish missions which we are never properly educated in. We may have done seven years of legal training, but at home we have never been offered even a single lesson in coping with the burdens of domestic existence. No one has any respect for the complexities of what they are trying to do; everyone assumes it should be easy and grows enraged and intolerant when it turns out it conclusively isn’t.
No wonder we secretly long for the smell of cheap coffee, the bright overhead lighting and the efficient beginnings to yet another narrowly purposeful day. The office has its challenges, no doubt, but next to what might be waiting for us at home, this may be the holidays.</p>
