            <h2>FOREBODING VS REMEMBERING</h2>
<p>Mental illness—which doesn’t present itself as an illness to us of course, it’s far too clever for that—frequently leads us to worry incessantly about the future: about bankruptcy, disgrace, physical collapse, abandonment. What is pernicious about this kind of worrying is that it attaches itself to genuine features of the here and now, presenting itself as reasonable. But on closer examination it clearly isn’t. There is always something to be alarmed by: turbulence in the economy, things that go wrong with our bodies, reputations rising and falling . . . But what should eventually alert us to the peculiarity of our position is the duration, scale, and repetitiveness of our worries. We should learn to see that we are essentially worried all the time about something. The focus may shift, but what is constant is our insecurity about existence. It is in such situations that a therapist may make a hugely useful intervention, pointing out that the way we worry about the future is in fact telling us a huge amount about our past. More specifically, we are worried right now in a way that mirrors the panic we once felt as children; we are greeting the challenges of the adult world with the defenseless panic of the child we once were. What we are doing in the process is exchanging the pain of remembering the difficult past for a sense of foreboding around the future. The catastrophe we fear is going to happen has already happened.</p>
<p>So sealed off are our memories, we project them forward, where they greet us as apprehensions of what is to come. Instead, we should identify them as legacies of unmasterable past anxiety. The good therapist becomes aware of the correct source of the anxiety—and doesn’t let go of their insight. They will listen politely and generously to our description of our current panic: What will happen in our job, have we studied enough, what if our enemies gang up on us? But then they will gently try to shift the conversation to the past, to show us that the future looks so fearful because we are being counterproductively loyal to the terrors of an earlier age, which we now need to remember, to feel sad about, and then eventually to mourn and move on from. We should be disloyal to those who brought us up in an atmosphere of fear in order to save what remains of life from always appearing doom-laden. We may be trying to stay close to them by continuing to panic alongside them, but we owe it to ourselves to break the circle of worry and to make our future different from the past by remembering, localizing, and mourning what belonged to yesterday even as it pretends to be about tomorrow.</p>
