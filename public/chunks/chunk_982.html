        <h4>How to Make a Home</h4>
<p>We started this journey with a story. You’ll remember what happened. There was a man who, despite owning everything, did not possess that one thing that anyone who has
  everything should rightly possess in order to be happy: a beautiful home.</p>
<p>You’ll remember what happened. He asked for advice. He hired an architect, and the architect built him a house which was perfect, and in which every room</p>
<p>was a symphony of colour, complete in itself. Walls, furniture, and fabrics harmonized in a subtle manner. Each article had its place and formed the most marvellous
      combinations with the others. The architect had not forgotten the least thing. Ashtrays, cutlery, candlesnuffers – he had composed everything, but everything. And it wasn’t just
      common or garden ornament, every form, every nail expressed the individuality of its owner.1</p>
<p>And we started our exploration about how to make a home with the same assumption – it’s a natural one to make in a book of domestic advice – that somehow, you
  can make your home better. Perfect, even.</p>
<p>We started with the building that must surely house any home – the house itself – and considered how, as Gaston Bachelard put it: the house we were born in ‘is our first
  universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word’.2 We reflected on the reflection of Frank Lloyd Wright that the house, in its ‘wooded
  sward or strand’, provides ‘a refuge for the expanding spirit of man, the individual’.3</p>
<p>Moving inside the house, to consider its internal workings, we followed the famous dictum of Le Corbusier that ‘the house is a machine for living in’: a well-ordered microcosmos,
  with a place for everything, and in which everything – every chair, table, bed and stool – has a place.</p>
<p>For such a home – a harmonious composition of architecture, furniture, objets d’art, and all the rest of it – forms the house that the architect designed to make our
  rich man happy. To make such a home is, as Wright wrote, to ‘make of a human dwelling-place a complete work of art, in itself expressive and beautiful, intimately related to modern life and
  fit to live in’.4</p>
<p>Such a house should contain only things which aid the workings of its machinery and the composition of its aesthetic order: things that, as William Morris wrote, are beautiful and useful, and
  are coordinated with the house as a whole. Anything else becomes mere clutter, causing, as Danny Miller suggested, ‘our relationships to things to come at the expense of our relationships to
  people’.5</p>
<p>And once such a work of art is made, we’ve seen, it is time to enjoy what has been created, for home, above all places, is a place of rest. Home is the place that, as Bachelard wrote,
  ‘shelters daydreaming . . . protects the dreamer [and] allows one to dream in peace’.6 That’s what all that harmony, all that
  comfort, all those cushions and curtains are for, isn’t it?</p>
<p>And being a place of rest, a little world built, furnished, ornamented and decorated according to our own individual tastes, it may be taken as read that home is a private place. It is the place
  in which we, like our rich man ensconced in his own little cosmos, surrounded by his family and his things, can be most fully ourselves.</p>
<p>It’s a tempting set of assumptions; and repeating them could have made this book easy and comforting both to write and to read. I could have shown you some beautiful houses, some elegant
  furniture, and some dazzling objects. I could have given you a rule or two for good taste, and given you a labour-saving tip or two. I could have told you to lock the door, put on the mood music,
  light the scented candles and leave the world behind.</p>
<p>A poor little rich man</p>
<p>But there’s another part to the story of the rich man – one I haven’t told you about yet. You see, the story doesn’t end quite as happily as all
  that.</p>
<p>Lovely as his new house was, the rich man wasn’t used to living artistically; and he did need some training to make himself at home in his new home. For the first few weeks after he moved
  in, the architect would turn up to supervise him, to ensure he kept things where they belonged in the carefully designed scheme of things.</p>
<p>The rich man didn’t mind, or he didn’t think he did; but, inadvertently, he found himself spending more and more time out of the house, staying late at work, or meeting his friends
  in town. When he was at home, looking around his beautiful rooms, he couldn’t stop himself shedding a little tear or two for some of the ugly old items of sentimental value the architect had
  advised him to throw away.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for the poor little rich man to live in his perfect home, you see; and, I suspect it wouldn’t be that easy for us either. You see, the problem with that ideal image of
  home is that it is just that: an ideal, an image, in a story. As we have discovered in this book, real homes, and the making of them, are quite different.</p>
<p>For a start, only a tiny minority of us will ever be able to build a house for ourselves. Most of us will be occupying an apartment in a building full of others that, as the poet Paul Claudel
  wrote, ‘inside its four walls is a sort of geometrical site, a conventional hole, which we furnish with pictures, objects and wardrobes within a wardrobe’.7</p>
<p>And what is more, those pictures, objects and wardrobes won’t have been designed for that home but will be like the furniture that Frank Lloyd Wright observed his own clients bringing with
  them as they ‘helplessly dragged the horrors of the old order along after them’.8 And what is more, once it’s there, we’ll
  keep moving it around to get comfortable.</p>
<p>Not that it was ever easy to make home into a work of art anyway, for domestic taste, after all, is not something that can be subjected to the eternal laws of art. Instead, it shifts along with
  our social relations, with fashion, as fast as we can keep up with it.</p>
<p>And as if that wasn’t bad enough, we’re all, just like the poor little rich man, the helpless recipients of gifts, the incorrigible collectors of clutter, irrepressible hoarders,
  whose insatiable appetite for objects makes our homes dissonant, disordered and untidy.</p>
<p>Not that we’d get to enjoy the beauty of our homes even if they were beautiful works of art. Like Mrs Beeton or Joan Rivers, we’re too busy doing the dishes and making the beds to
  wander around them savouring their arrangements.</p>
<p>And even the idea of home as a private refuge is something that has only ever really been available to a privileged few. It is increasingly becoming something of an illusion, as we crowd
  ourselves into ever larger and denser cities, broadcast more and more of what used to be our private lives online, and spend more and more of our time at work and at play in public.</p>
<p>If this book has taught us anything, I hope it is that home is rarely what we expect or assume it will be. Far from being the ‘proof or illusion of stability’ that Gaston Bachelard
  argued it to be, it is the unstable, temporary meeting place of all sorts of things – buildings, furniture, objects, and of course people, all on journeys of their own from one place or time
  to another.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you what happened to the poor little rich man in the end. It didn’t turn out well, but I guess you’ve guessed that already.</p>
<p>One day, the poor little rich man had a birthday party. His family showered him with gifts, and after the party, he decided to ask the architect around to share his happy day. He welcomed him
  in, and proudly showed him the gifts he had been given, arranged on the mantelpiece in the salon.</p>
<p>You can imagine what happened: the architect was furious, and berated his charge: ‘What do you think you are doing, getting presents given you? Have I not designed everything for you? Have
  I not thought of everything? You don’t need anything else. You are complete.’9</p>
<p>And so it was finished. What a poor little rich man, indeed, to be complete, and finished. Perfect.</p>
<p>Thank goodness it’s just a story. After all, would any of us really want our homes to be as stable, as complete, as finished as the poor little rich man, and his artwork of a home?</p>
<p>How to make an imperfect home</p>
<p>If this book has one single message, it is that home is not something that will ever be complete. Home is a set of strategies we use to make ourselves at home in a world that,
  as we have just seen, stubbornly resists the urge to stand still for long enough for us to perfect it.</p>
<p>That building a home does not always involve the construction of a new house does not mean that a house rebuilt or reoccupied cannot possess a beauty all of its own, or, on the other hand, that
  it cannot reflect the selves of all the people that have ever occupied it. After all, Jung’s archetypical alternative to the child’s drawing of a house, the one constructed and
  reconstructed over centuries, would be a wonderful place to inhabit and explore.</p>
<p>And that there isn’t a perfect place for everything in the home is in fact an opportunity: for ephemeral, liberating play as anarchic as that of Jacques Tati’s uncle, as he subverts
  a joyless Corbusian machine, reminding us that if homes are machines for living in, it is the living, in all its dynamic, unpredictable complexity, that must take priority over mechanics.</p>
<p>Homes weren’t, and aren’t, and needn’t be works of art. They are settings, as ephemeral as those of the theatre or the fairground, for the little, repeated and temporary performances of our lives, from dining in good taste, a la Elsie de Wolfe, or the carefully constructed cuisine paysanne of Bourdieu’s petite
  bourgeoisie. Positive beauty might reside in mathematical abstraction, arbitrary beauty in the eye of the beholder; but décor, like dressing up for dinner, or down for breakfast, is social,
  as well as personal and conceptual.</p>
<p>Ornaments are not a crime. Like the gifts that his family gave the poor little rich man, the child’s drawing brought home for him from the kindergarten, or the old ashtray he could never
  quite bring himself to throw away, our possessions are not, as they might seem to be at first, the contents of a pharaonic tomb, in which we bury ourselves under our own greed. They are, as we
  endlessly arrange and rearrange them, what Danny Miller calls ‘configurations of human values, feelings, and experience’.10</p>
<p>Home is a setting we make and remake, clean and tidy, and make and mend endlessly. It’s a sort of work which, if only we could see it, and think about it as such, creates little islands of
  time, separate from the pressures of career, progress, history, improvement and all the rest of it, which crowd the rest of our lives. Remember that, and you can make, unlikely as it may sound,
  ‘drudgerie divine’.11</p>
<p>You’ll never really escape the world, not even hiding under your duvet at home. Lock the door behind you, and it’ll still be there. You’ll still have to go out into it tomorrow
  morning, or sometime. Privacy doesn’t exist in places. Like rest, like the little plays of our lives, like our developing sense of ourselves, like our endless changing needs, and our very
  sense of where we have come from, it exists in something else.</p>
<p>The author of the ‘Poor Little Rich Man’, Adolf Loos, revealed the moral of his tale in, of all things, an essay on furniture. He wrote:</p>
<p>Are we human beings ever finished, complete in our physical and psychological development? Do we ever come to a standstill? And if a human being is in constant movement and
      development, if old needs disappear and new ones arise, if nature as a whole and everything around us is always changing, should the thing that is closest to a human being, his home, remain
      unchanged, dead, furnished for all time?12</p>
<p>And there are messages we can take away from this tale of home, too.</p>
<p>The first is perhaps the least controversial: it is simply that home is a social as well as an individual idea. This is obvious insofar as home is something we associate with family. It is less
  obvious, perhaps, that our homes are one of the primary means through which we position ourselves in wider society. This might mean arguing about who has to clean the common stair in the apartment
  block, or who will cut the hedge along a mutual boundary. It might mean pushing back all the furniture against the wall for a party, or proudly displaying one’s most prized possessions in a
  cabinet, or on a noticeboard on the kitchen wall. It might reside in the ways in which we judge others by their taste in décor, or look anxiously around at the colour choices of people whose
  culinary judgement we admire. It might mean joining in the washing up after dinner with friends. Home isn’t just where we go to escape the world of other people. It is how we live in it.</p>
<p>Secondly, our sense of how we relate to home has shifted fundamentally in recent years: we live in an age in which access is rapidly coming to take precedence over ownership. One could call it a
  revolution, or a return to ancient understandings of ‘the commons’ – an increasingly fashionable term. For instance, I find it a great deal cheaper and easier to become a member
  of a car club than to own a car: I spend less money, I am freed of the responsibilities of care, but I still have convenient access to a vehicle when I need one. In the same way, I’d rather
  subscribe to Spotify than have a record collection, or rent a TV than own one.</p>
<p>We may live in a world of unprecedented plenty; but in spite of it, or perhaps because we take objects so much for granted, we have become a great deal less interested in the permanent ownership
  of things than in access to the affordances they supply. It is ironic that in a world where everything is for sale, we end up buying services rather than things.</p>
<p>In an age in which house prices spiral out of proportion to salaries, more and more people are realizing that it may make more sense to rent a home rather than to own one. It’s something
  that has made a commercial sensation out of Airbnb, whose principle is, after all, that we should share our houses round, rather than, like dogs in mangers, sit in them alone. In the same way, a
  generation who cannot afford to buy their own homes has evolved a culture of rental or squatting, would prefer to buy disposable, repeatable furniture from IKEA rather than polish irreplaceable
  inherited pieces, and might value the ability to share a JPEG as much as to pass on an heirloom.</p>
<p>And that leads me to the final morals of this tale. They are, I hope, simple.</p>
<p>We are only ever the temporary occupants of the buildings we inhabit, which will almost always last longer than we will.</p>
<p>And our occupations are dynamic, as we shift furniture around to suit our momentary or quotidian needs; and as we endlessly collect, arrange, rearrange, or dispose of all the countless objects
  that pass through our hands.</p>
<p>Our homes are, after all, nothing more than the ephemeral arrangements, illusory scenery, staged to frame the little plays of our lives.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they are nothing more than moments of respite, in which, in seemingly repetitive rhythms of housework, we step outside the treadmills set for us by the world outside, or seek moments
  of respite from the glare of public life.</p>
<p>All along, we have worked with the assumption that home resides in spaces, objects, and surfaces. We have assumed that, somehow, home can be found in a place, or that, in making places and
  things, we can make a home.</p>
<p>And all along, we have found that those places or things that can guarantee privacy, repose, beauty, balance, function and origin are, like the end of the rainbow, just out of reach.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s because home isn’t a place, after all. Perhaps, instead, it’s a time.</p>
