        <h3>¶ Pessimism</h3>
<p>A pessimist is someone who calmly assumes from the outset, and with a great deal of justification, that things tend to turn out badly in almost all areas of existence. Strange though it can sound, pessimism is one of the greatest sources of human serenity and contentment.</p>
<p>The reasons are legion. Relationships are rarely if ever the blissful marriage of two minds and hearts that Romanticism teaches us to expect; sex is invariably an area of tension and longing; creative endeavour is pretty much always painful, compromised and slow; any job – however appealing on paper – will be irksome in many of its details; children will always resent their parents, however well-intentioned and kindly the adults may try to be. Politics is evidently a process of muddle and unsatisfactory compromise.</p>
<p>Our satisfaction in this life is critically dependent on our expectations. The greater our hopes, the greater the risks of rage, bitterness, disappointment and a sense of persecution.</p>
<p>Many forces in our society conspire to stoke our hopes unfairly. Our commercial and political culture is tragically built upon the manufacture of promises of improbably beautiful scenarios. These forces tap into a natural, though profoundly mistaken, tendency of the human mind to think that the possession of hope must be the key to happiness (and kindness).</p>
<p>Like optimists, pessimists would like things to go well. But by recognising that many things can, and probably will, go wrong, the pessimist is adroitly placed to secure the good outcome both of these parties ultimately seek. It is the pessimist who, having never expected anything to go right, tends to end up with one or two things to smile about.</p>
