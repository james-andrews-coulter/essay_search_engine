            <h2>III : Art</h2>
<p>Art can be a tool with which to combat some of our worst mental afflictions. When it shows us pretty and inspiring things and even—especially when—it shows us melancholy ones, it fortifies us against nihilism and hardness of heart.</p>
<p>We all benefit from having to hand a private gallery of images to shore us up. What follows is an example of such a museum of the mind. It has little to do with those grand national galleries of art sculpted from granite and marble where floors are dedicated to the important movements of art—and where, exhausted and overwhelmed, our thoughts wisely often soon turn to the cafeteria and—with luck—cake. This is a miniature gallery of images that we might look at in bed or in the bath to slow down and reverse a slide into self-hatred and terror. It wants us to hang on and wait for dawn.</p>
<p>Religions knew what art was for. It had nothing to do with remembering dates or understanding techniques. It was for crying with and imploring. It was for kneeling down in a solemn hall in front of, so that Vishnu or Guanyin, Mary or Nivaranaviskhambhin could hear what was tearing us apart: that there would be no more money at the end of the month, that our partner was cold-hearted, that we had seduced the wrong person, that our children had no love in them, that we felt like a failure, that we wanted to die.</p>
<p>We may no longer believe in gods very much, but this doesn’t mean that art has abandoned its capacity to console and rescue us. Secular works of art—a careful painting of four daffodils in a jar in early April, a silvery photograph of the Sierra Nevada, an embroidered tapestry of a llama, an abstract canvas of dark blues and greens, a sketch of a sheep and its young, or a study of a river at dusk—retain the power to rescue our moods and rearrange our priorities.</p>
<p>In this small portable museum, we are invited to be as emotional as we might once have felt in a temple or a church. We can fall into solemn reflection, we can cry, we can feel sorry for ourselves, and we can vow to change our lives. The artists would have wanted us to do so very much.</p>
<p>It may be a time of distress right now; it might be night and we might be in a hotel, a clinic, or an unheated spare bedroom. It may feel as though we are entirely alone and that no one could possibly understand. They do.</p>
<p>As much as pills, therapy, walks, a thoughtful friend, baths, a lot of sleep, and perhaps the occasional fig, this gallery of images is a tool in the service of our frayed psyches. This is art against despair.</p>
<p>1 Six Persimmons</p>
<p>Everything has become abundant, everything is in reach. We can have produce from the four corners. Fruit is flown in from anywhere—even persimmons, which taste rich and honey-like when ripe, with the texture of an apricot and a skin like an apple’s.</p>
<p>But the tragedy is also that we don’t notice anything much of what we have. Buddhism takes aim at our haste and our neglect. In failing to appreciate the things before us, we become far more avaricious and dissatisfied than we need to be. We dream of fame and elevated status. We call our circumstances narrow and uninspiring, when in reality we have omitted to do them justice. We seek a better world without having taken stock of the one already to hand. If we were able to open our eyes, there would be so many universes for us to see right in front of us.</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist monk—no one is ever just an “artist” in Buddhism—Muqi Fachang completed his rendition of six persimmons in the middle of the thirteenth century, around the end of the Southern Song dynasty. Those with a sympathy for the lessons of his creed have been looking at them carefully ever since, especially after they reached Japan in 1606 and were given pride of place in a meditation hall in the Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto.</p>
<p>There is ostensibly nothing very special about the persimmons—and that is precisely the point. Those who are in a hurry, those who are unable in the end to notice and draw value from anything, will rush past them as they will so much else. Muqi is trying to slow down our impatient gaze. He deliberately empties the visual field and sets these modest works of nature in front of us for reflective contemplation, daring us to ignore them while also beseeching us—with all the resources of his art—not to.</p>
<p>The painting’s guardians in Kyoto traditionally asked that we pause to look at the work for at least three minutes, which can feel like an awfully long time. But when we accept the challenge, after around the first thirty seconds our breathing is likely to slow and we may start to see how much there is to appreciate. Each persimmon, though “the same” from a distance, emerges as distinct in size, shape, and color. What we might initially have thought of as identical declares itself as rife with difference. Each persimmon is, we can now see, as individual as a child is to its parent.</p>
<p>What Muqi asked us to do with pieces of fruit we might carry out with the world more broadly: We might take a second and third look at loaves of bread, clouds, paving stones, the books on our shelves, blades of grass and—most importantly—one another. Once we have learned to draw value from inexpensive things, we can never be poor, whatever our ostensible level of wealth, and we can never be bored, however quiet things might have become. The persimmons are with great humility doing momentous work for us: They are pointing us toward a path of liberation.</p>
<p>Muqi Fachang, Six Persimmons, 13th century.</p>
<p>2 Albrecht Dürer and His Pillows</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful and unexpectedly moving sketches in the world was completed by the German artist Albrecht Dürer in 1493, when he was twenty-two years old and apprenticed in his native Nuremberg. It shows six pillows, probably his own, in a variety of shapes and positions.</p>
<p>On the other side of the paper, Dürer drew himself looking at us with penetration and inquisitiveness, alongside a version of his hand and, at the bottom, for good measure, another—seventh—pillow.</p>
<p>A pillow has no distinguished place in the order of the universe. We are unlikely ever to have paid much attention to this modest household object. We take its existence for granted, owe it no special gratitude and are unlikely ever to have been detained by its qualities. Like so much else that we are surrounded by, we see it without noticing it. It belongs to a vast category of things which we rely on without for an instant stopping to wonder at, or deriving any satisfaction from, them. We are—for the most part—wholly blind.</p>
<p>In the face of our customary inattention, it may help us greatly that, a long time ago, a genius arrested his gaze in order to tell us that, among the neglected detritus of a household, there might be something worth bothering with; that a pillow, properly considered, might be as interesting as a castle or as nuanced as a poem; and that we have all along been putting our heads down on a treasury.</p>
<p>It matters, too—though it shouldn’t ideally—that Dürer’s work is highly acclaimed; that the pillow image is stored in a special temperature-controlled room in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art; that it has been the subject of extensive study by elaborately trained art historians; and that it has a higher value than a sports car. We are, by nature, immoderately snobbish creatures and appreciate principally what we have been encouraged to be curious about by the most prestigious voices in society. This means that we spend a lot of time thinking about fame and glory, and no time at all attending to most of what lies closest to us, which includes not just our pillows, but also the lemon on the sideboard, the light at dusk, an afternoon free of commitments, the flowers in the garden, the laughter of a child, the kindness of a friend, a history book on the shelf, and the many small moments of harmony and satisfaction that—despite our many difficulties—we have already witnessed.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer, Six Studies of Pillows (verso), 1493.</p>
<p>One of the most acclaimed artists of the European Renaissance lends us his immense prestige in order that we might in turn learn to draw pleasure from thoroughly unprestigious things. We declare our lives to be worthless, we cast envious glances at the achievements of our rivals, but all along we trample on what keener, more alert eyes would know how to feast on.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Dürer looked at ordinary life and saw it for the unlikely, ecstatic, jewel-filled pantheon it is. Some years after the pillows, he completed a study of a range of ordinary plants and grasses and wondered at the capacity of the smallest clod of earth to give life to so much beauty and interest.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the realm of worldly ambition than a few columbines. Such flowers grow freely in seemingly unpromising stony soil. There’s no market for them; no one has ever boasted of owning what is more or less a weed. But for Dürer, such spectacles of nature were among the most serious sources of pleasure that exist, worth as much as any coat of arms and more likely to satisfy us than a love affair. He relished the delicacy of shoots. He admired the individuality of petals and the subdued yet subtle colors of new leaves. Fulfillment—which we are taught exists only in a good reputation, financial achievement, and costly decorative objects—may be already here, waiting for us in a crack in the sidewalk or in a window box.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer, Self-Portrait, Study of a Hand and a Pillow (recto), 1493.</p>
<p>We may not have Dürer’s talent but we don’t, in this instance, need it. We’re not trying to become artists; we’re trying to become people who have reasons to live. And in this regard, Dürer is generous. He is reminding us that there are reasons everywhere: in the way the light falls on a cup, in a few words with someone who still cares about us, in a banana cake we might make tomorrow. The lesson is not to focus on exactly the same things that Dürer studied—though we might do this too—it’s to take his attitude of generosity, openness, and modesty and apply it to our own circumstances. We might find our version of his satisfaction in a pattern of lichen on an old stone wall or in the refined elegance of a boiled egg.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer, Columbine, 1495–1500.</p>
<p>So compelling was Dürer’s skill as an artist that he came to the notice of the rich and powerful of his day, including—most consequentially—the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. Maximilian loved horses, wars, armor, and pageantry. Most of all, he loved himself, for all the grand and important things he had done: expanding the Habsburg dynasty to Spain, recapturing Austria, checking the power of the French. He asked Dürer to make him a work of art that would fully celebrate his achievements, his character, and his place in history—and urged him to make it as big as possible. Money was no object. The result was one of the largest prints ever made, three meters high, laid out on thirty-six gigantic sheets of paper from 195 separate woodblocks. The central arch was called “Honour and Might,” the right arch “Nobility” and the left arch—quite simply—“Praise.” Each one was densely packed with illustrations highlighting Maximilian’s wisdom, courage, strength, popularity, and good nature. In one area, there was a complicated family tree that traced his lineage back to Clovis I, the first king of the Franks, and in another, a table that equated his achievements with those of Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Maximilian was delighted. He praised Dürer to all the aristocracy and had copies of the work delivered to every corner of his lands. But the artist was less content: He had done it for the money and his heart wasn’t remotely into such bombast. Too much in his character went in other directions: toward the everyday, toward humility, and toward an awareness of how disaster might strike each one of us, even or especially the mighty ones, at any moment.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer, Triumphal Arch, c. 1515.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer, The Four Horsemen, from “The Apocalypse,” 1498.</p>
<p>Dürer’s mind was dominated by terrifying visions of what fate might have in store: disease, famine, injustice, and war laying waste to our dreams and ambitions. In his self-portraits, he never disguised his anxiety. In a second early work, he showed himself holding in his right hand a shriveled thistle, a symbol of pain, decay, and defeat. His look of suspicion and wariness is directed not at us but at himself. He knew how quickly, and with how few wrong moves, we can all be undone.</p>
<p>Ruin or disgrace may well catch up with us. Things collapse, plans turn sour—shortly after the arch was done, for example, Maximilian fell into a depression and, inconsolable, insisted on sleeping in a coffin, which was carried around all day with him; he died a few years later. But we don’t always need the very large elements of our lives to succeed in order for existence to be bearable. We can survive and in distinctive ways thrive through a disciplined focus on the smaller elements around us that lie more reliably within our command and that offer us pleasure without exacting envy or punishing effort. We can nourish ourselves on the sight of flowers, on the smell of freshly baked bread, on an evening writing our diary, or on a walk around the park. We can take pleasure in an apricot, in a hot bath, in some flowering weeds—and, not least, in our own set of pillows that have so often and so generously, in the wake of our disappointments, received our tears.</p>

<p>3 Kersting and Lamplight</p>
<p>We might be tempted to feel rather sorry for someone who confessed that their greatest pleasure in life was staying at home—or, yet worse, that their deepest satisfactions sprang from interior design. What would need to have gone wrong for someone to prefer their own bedroom or kitchen to the theaters and clubs, parties and conference venues of the world? How narrow would someone’s horizons need to have grown for them to devote hours to choosing a flower-ringed vase for the sideboard or a brass lamp for the study? Our era has a hard time maintaining sympathy for domesticity. Reality lies outside our doors. There are really only two categories of people who can be forgiven for being heavily invested in staying at home: small children . . . and losers.</p>
<p>But after launching our ambitions on the high seas, after trying for a few decades to make a mark on our times, after exhausting ourselves sucking up to those in power and coping with gossip, slander, and scandal, we might start to think less harshly of those who prefer to remain within their own walls and think a lot—and with pride—about cushions and jugs, pencil pots and garlic crushers, laundry cupboards and cleaning products.</p>
<p>It might, of course, be preferable to manage to bend the world to our own will, to tidy up the minds of millions, or to fashion a business in our own image, but after a bit of time on the planet, some of us may be ready to look with new understanding and admiration at those who can draw satisfaction from making blackberry jam, planting beds of lavender, or waxing bedroom floors.</p>
<p>The painter Georg Friedrich Kersting was born in northern Germany in 1785 and as a young man wanted to become a great military general and perform heroic deeds in battle. He dreamed of helping to expel the French armies that, under Napoleon, occupied large areas of the German states. After briefly studying art in Copenhagen, Kersting joined the Lützow Free Corps, a Prussian volunteer force, and saw action at the Battle of the Göhrde, in which thousands lost their lives and after which he received the Iron Cross for bravery.</p>
<p>But after the defeat of Napoleon, during the political impasse that befell the German states, something changed in Kersting. He retired from the military, gave up on politics, moved to Dresden, got married, had some children—and became very interested in the idea of home.</p>
<p>He had had enough of the machinations of government and the schemes of generals, of German nationalism and wars of liberation. Such ventures and the ideals that supported them became bound up in his mind with hubris and overreach. He was haunted by the bloodletting that he had witnessed and the friends from the military he had lost. From now on, what would interest him was the challenge of leading a good enough ordinary life in domestic circumstances and of remaining sane and serene when there was so much that might unbalance and perturb him. He closed the door on the world and became a prophet of the consolations and beauty of home.</p>
<p>In 1817, Kersting completed one of the most quietly remarkable and beguiling of all paintings. Embroiderer shows a young woman in a dignified modest dress absorbed in her work at an open window. We cannot see her face but can imagine her lips pursed in concentration, the little finger on her right hand extended and taut as she struggles to thread her needle. The interior is peaceful and inviting, without being in any way showy or extravagant. Someone has thought hard about how the mauve couch will create an intriguing contrast with the green wallpaper, and the chunky wooden floorboards have been matched up with an especially graceful chair and table, suggesting a reconciliation between practicality and elegance.</p>
<p>Georg Friedrich Kersting, Embroiderer, 1817.</p>
<p>A few years later, Kersting completed an equally iconic companion piece. This time it is night and a woman is again at work, doing some darning. A lamp has been swung into place and the room is bathed in a soft light—soon it will be time to make some camomile tea, kiss somebody on the forehead and rearrange their teddy and then, gradually, go to bed. The task isn’t distinguished or obviously memorable, there will be no government medals or honors handed out as thanks for it, but, through Kersting’s eyes, we’re in no doubt that something very special is going on. The sitter has been cast as a secular saint of a new home-focused creed which rejects prevailing assumptions about where glory might lie and what must count as intelligent and purposeful. Perhaps those who focus on home will not gain distinction or renown, their graves will not commemorate any obviously glittering deed, but they will nevertheless have played a role in supporting civilization. It is to misunderstand where satisfaction lies to insist that fulfillment can exist only in cabinet rooms and boardrooms, stock markets and opera houses. The more imaginative will know the distinctive pleasures of preparing a family meal or painting a room, hanging a new picture or filling a vase with hyacinths and lilies of the valley.</p>
<p>Georg Friedrich Kersting, Young Woman Sewing by Lamplight, 1823.</p>
<p>We might once have wanted to tame and educate the entire world, to have millions of people agree with us and gain the adulation of strangers. But such plans are inherently unstable and open to being destroyed by envy and vanity. We should gain security from knowing how much a devotion to home can shore up our moods if our wider surroundings grow hostile. When we have become a laughing stock, when no one wants to know us any more, we can reactivate our dormant appreciation of our surroundings and find meaning in nothing greater or smaller than sewing on a few buttons in the late evening or choosing a new fabric for a chair. Kersting was not naive: he understood how war, politics, and business worked. But it was precisely because he did so that he was keen to throw his spotlight elsewhere. His art was—in the deep sense—political, in that it articulated a vision of how we should ideally live: It covertly criticized military generals and emperors, business leaders and actors. It told us that waving flags at rallies or sounding important at meetings was all well and good, but that the true battles were really elsewhere, in the trials of ordinary existence, and that what counted as a proper victory was an ability to remain calm in the face of provocation, not to despair, not to give way to bitterness, to vanquish paranoia, to decode our own mind and to pay due attention to passing moments of grace.</p>
<p>Kersting spent much time in his own study, which he represented in a number of sketches and one especially famous painting. He must sometimes have regretted his old ambitions. It must have hurt that he never made a fortune and that he remained, in his lifetime, relatively undiscovered. There would have been days when he felt that he had made all the wrong choices. Nevertheless, his art continues to be a point of reference for those who have had enough of trying to bring order to the public square. It urges us to accept the consolation and peace available in ceasing to worry what others think and learning to limit our ambitions to the boundaries of our own dwellings and laundry cupboards.</p>
<p>Georg Friedrich Kersting, Man Reading by Lamplight, 1814.</p>
<p>Tonight, we might—once more—choose to stay in, do some reading, finish patching a hole in a cardigan, try a new place for the armchair, and be intensely grateful that we have overcome the wish to live too much in the minds of strangers.</p>
<p>4 Hokusai and Melancholy</p>
<p>There are two ways of looking at Mount Fuji. As a geological phenomenon, it is classified as an active basalt composite stratovolcano, 3,700 meters high and 10,000 years old in its most recent form, which last exploded in 1708. Located on the island of Honshu in central Japan, on the fault line where the Eurasian, Okhotsk, and Philippine plates meet, it has a mounting pressure inside its magma chamber of 1.6 megapascals and an average temperature at its summit of −5°C (23°F).</p>
<p>But Mount Fuji is simultaneously a psycho-spiritual phenomenon interpreted in both the Shinto and Zen Buddhist traditions as a conduit to, and guardian of, wisdom and enlightenment. There are temples and rituals in its honor. It is understood to have a meaning; it wants to tell us things. For Buddhism, humans are perpetually at risk of forgetting their true irrelevant position within the natural world. We overlook our powerlessness and unimportance in the universal order. This amnesia isn’t a helpful illusion; it is responsible for much of our frustration, anger, and vain self-assertion. We rage at events because we cannot see the necessities we are up against. Buddhism regularly turns our attention to natural elements—rocks, rain showers, streams, giant cedar trees, the stars—because it sees in these ways we can gracefully come to terms with our denied subservience. We can be reminded that we have no alternative but to submit to nature’s laws and that our freedom comes from adjusting our individual egos to what defies us. For Zen, Fuji is only the largest conveyor of a general truth, but it deserves special reverence because of the extraordinary elegance and primordial simplicity with which it delivers its message. Its beauty, visible on a clear day when its cone is newly sprinkled with snow, makes it a little easier to accept that we will die, that our plans will be ground to sand, that what we achieve will not matter and that we are as nothing next to the aeons of time to which the earth has been witness.</p>
<p>The printmaker and artist Katsushika Hokusai was in his seventies and already famous in Japan when he hit on the idea that would immortalize his name. The project was to capture Fuji obliquely, to make it feel almost by the by and yet also magnetically present in a series of “Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,” published between 1830 and 1832. Hokusai never lets us forget the contrast between the eternal steadiness of Fuji, constantly resplendent and serene somewhere in the background, and the agitation, struggle, pain and overexcitement of human lives. We catch Fuji peeking out from behind a busy bridge over the Onagi river as it joins the Sumida; it’s in the background as workers and travelers do business together in the Sundai district of Edo; it’s there as a peasant leads a horse laden with saddlebags full of grass in Senju; it’s watching as a half-naked craftsman makes a barrel in Owari province and as workers fix the roof of the Mitsui department store in Edo (a sign says: “Cash only”); it’s discreetly in the frame as some clam fishermen fill their baskets in Noboto Bay and a group of pleasure seekers have refreshments at a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) on Goten-Yama Hill near Shinagawa.</p>
<p>In some of the prints, the contrast between the puny defenselessness of vainglorious humans and the indifference of mighty nature is at a pitch. We feel pity and melancholy for our pride and what we are up against. In the tenth view in the series, we see a group of travelers wending their way around rice paddies on the eastern sea route near Ejiri in Suruga province. It’s fall and a gust of wind has just blown. That’s all that may be needed to break our fragile hold on order. Hokusai’s humans are at once thrown into chaos. They struggle to hold on to their hats, their possessions fly into the paddy fields, and most notably someone’s papers—they might be anything from the manuscript of a novel to some tax returns, though what they really stand for is human logic and presumption—are being carried off into oblivion, to end up in an adjoining province or a nearby muddy ditch. This, Hokusai is telling us, is what man is: easily buffeted, one gust away from disaster, defenseless before nature, trying to work out what it all means on bits of paper that are as evanescent as fireflies.</p>
<p>Katsushika Hokusai, Ejiri in Suruga Province (Sunshū Ejiri), from the series “Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei),” c. 1830–32.</p>
<p>In the eighth view, the sun is setting over Fuji; it will be dark in half an hour. A couple of hikers are ascending the steep Inume Pass while, a long way behind them, two traders are following with heavily laden horses. We can tell this latter pair are in trouble. Those horses won’t make it up the pass in the darkness; there’s a strong risk someone will fall down a precipice. This may be the end of the road for the unfortunate traders. But the wider mood is not mournful or panicked. Fuji is serene, as it always is, even when in its shadow people are being buried or dying of cancer or imploring the heavens or regretting their lives. Nature doesn’t care one bit about us—which is both the origin of our damnation and, when we have learned to identify with its motions, a source of redemption.</p>
<p>Katsushika Hokusai, The Inume Pass in Kai Province (Kōshū Inume tōge), from the series “Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei),” c. 1830–32.</p>
<p>Then there is the most famous view of all, the first in the series. Three fishing boats are out at sea off the coast of Kanagawa. They are the fast oshiokuri-bune boats, each powered by eight muscular rowers, that would catch fresh fish—typically tuna, sea bass, or flounder—for the marketplaces and restaurants of Edo. But today nature has other plans. It doesn’t care about this evening’s uramaki or the lives of thirty little people with families and dependants and hopes of their own. It’s decided to send a giant wave, twelve meters high, to toss things about and remind humanity of who is in charge. We shudder at the fate of the fishermen and the other passengers on board. This doesn’t look like a picture of survival, more of a prelude to a wake. Fuji looks on impassively, appearing like a wave of its own, its tiny-seeming snow-capped peak impersonating the foaming sea closer by. We are pawns in the hands of forces that care nothing for us and will not mourn us a moment when we are gone.</p>
<p>Hokusai could have chosen to anchor his melancholy meditations on human powerlessness to any number of natural phenomena: “Thirty-six Views of the Moon,” “Thirty-six Views of Drifting Clouds,” “Thirty-six Views of the Constellation Cassiopeia”—a dim speck in the northern hemisphere 4,000 light years away. Against these, too, his genius could have shown up our exploits in all their absurdity: a couple squabbling, a writer finishing a book, a person weeping at their medical diagnosis, a lover pining for companionship.</p>
<p>Katsushika Hokusai, Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as The Great Wave, from the series “Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei),” c. 1830–32.</p>
<p>We are fated to have to take seriously ambitions and desires that make no sense in the wider scheme. We have to live knowing that most of what we do is in a cosmic sense ridiculous. Our lives are no more profound than those of an earthworm and almost as fragile. In so far as we can ever recover a little meaning, it is by ceasing to worry so much about ourselves and identifying instead with planetary reality—even to the point where we might contemplate our own mortality with a degree of resigned equanimity, fully and generously appreciating our absurdity—and using it as a springboard to kindness, art, and the right kind of sadness.</p>
<p>5 Mark Rothko and the Seagram Murals</p>
<p>The most unexpectedly uplifting and consoling artist of the twentieth century was the abstract painter Mark Rothko, the high priest of grief and loss, who spent the latter part of his career turning out a succession of sublime and somber canvases that spoke, as he put it, of the “tragedy of being human” and who in 1970, at the age of sixty-six, committed suicide in his studio in New York by overdosing on barbiturates and slitting an artery in his right arm.</p>
<p>Born in Dvinsk, Russia, Rothko emigrated to the United States at the age of ten and immediately grew to despise the aggressive good cheer and steely optimism of his adopted land. He was a latter-day Leopardi or Pascal adrift in Disney World. Appalled by the sentimentality around him, he learned to make art that was insular, unrelenting, and oriented toward pain. It was, one critic said, the visual equivalent of a condemned prisoner’s last gasp. Rothko’s favorite colors were a burnt burgundy, dark gray, pitch black, and blood red, occasionally alleviated by a sliver of yellow.</p>
<p>In 1958, Rothko was offered a large sum to paint some murals for a soon-to-be-opened opulent New York restaurant, the Four Seasons, in the Seagram Building on Park Avenue. It was, as he put it, “a place where the richest bastards of New York will come to feed and show off.” His intentions for them soon became clear: ‘I hope to ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats in that room.’ And to that end, he set to work on some large black and maroon color fields expressing a mood of terror and archaic anguish. It was an unlikely commission for Rothko to have accepted, but it became ever more so in his mind when, following a trip to Italy, where he had been much moved by Giotto’s renditions of the crucifixion, in the fall of 1959 he took his wife, Mell, to the restaurant for lunch. His hatred became overwhelming. Believing it was “criminal to spend more than $5 on a meal,” he couldn’t get over the overpriced dishes, the fancy sauces and the ponderous waiting staff. “Anybody who will eat that kind of food for those kind of prices will never look at a painting of mine,” he vowed. But he hated the clientele even more: suntanned, cheery rich people, out to celebrate and show themselves off, to cut deals and swap gossip, the apparent winners of life, the kind who invested in tennis lessons and whitened their teeth. His hatred of them had its roots in his sense that we only accede to our humanity when we face pain and commune around it with compassion and humility. Anything else is grandstanding and pride. He had remained Russian in his soul.</p>
<p>Following the lunch, Rothko called up his patrons, explained his feelings, and sent back the money. He then gave his paintings to London’s Tate Gallery, where they were hung in a quiet, airy, contemplative, religious-seeming space that enclosed the viewer in an atmosphere of meditative mortification. The paintings remain ideal companions for visitors who drift into the gallery at their wits’ end, who might be working through the loss of a partner or the ruin of their career and who need more than anything else to know that they are not alone. Rothko’s art did not save his life but it will have prevented many others from taking theirs.</p>
<p>Rothko’s canvases—though focused on the darkness—are never themselves depressing to look at because they lend our difficulties dignity and legitimacy. To bathe in their atmosphere is to gain a distinct sense of comfort, like lying in the arms of a tender person who says little other than a modest “I know” in response to our dejection and loss. With Rothko as our guide, it matters a little less that the world is mostly filled with noisy, brash, apparent winners, that no one much cares for us, that we have failed in numberless areas, that our name isn’t in lights, that we have enemies, and that we are no longer young. We are offered a refuge from the boosterish voices of contemporary society and are able to locate in an external form works that echo our own confused and inchoate sorrows.</p>
<p>Mark Rothko, Red on Maroon, 1959.</p>
<p>A great part of our misery is caused by the cruel and erroneous assumption that life might fundamentally be a pleasant journey, capable of delivering satisfaction and delight to those who work hard and retain noble and purposeful hearts.</p>
<p>The truth could not be further from such a sentimental vision. Agony is baked into the human condition. We are suffering not by coincidence but by necessity. We may be focused on the particular errors and cruelties that have brought us to a low point, we may be narrowly concerned with what our enemies have done to us, how a few mistakes have cost us everything or how we have been abandoned by those who should have cared for us. But it isn’t to minimize these problems to insist that they are merely local manifestations of more global and endemic troubles. They are in reality the specific mechanisms by which we have come to taste the sorrow that would—however fate had twisted our path—have been our lot and is the grisly birthright of every human. We must all ultimately drink the very same amount of poisoned liquid from the cup of sorrow, even if in different gulps and at different times. No one gets through unscathed.</p>
<p>Yet not only are we sad, we are isolated and lonely with our sadness, because the official narrative is remorselessly upbeat, insisting that we can find the right partner, that work can deliver satisfaction, that destinies are fair, and that there is no inherent reason for us to lament our state. However, we don’t deserve—on top of everything else—to be forced to grin. We should be allowed to weep without being hectored into positivity. Our true overlooked right is not, after all, the right to happiness; it is the right to be miserable.</p>
<p>This may sound far from a reason to live, but the ability to look darkness in the face and accept its role in our affairs functions as its own very particular and intense reward. No longer must we be surprised by our suffering. No longer must we be taken unawares by misery. No longer do we have to feel that our reversals say something unique and shocking about us. We can start to rediscover a taste for life when we see that we’re not alone in wanting to give up on it; that it is acceptable, even necessary, sometimes to hate the smiling “bastards” who so annoyed Rothko and anyone else with a heart. We can build friendships—imaginative, artistic, or real—around shared honesty about tragedy. We will have banked our first reason to live when we know that we aren’t exceptionally stupid for finding matters very difficult. Unhappiness is just—as wise artists have always liked to remind us, and despite the suggestions of all the adverts, the brochures, and the confident-seeming people congratulating themselves in the world’s fancy restaurants—very normal indeed.</p>
<p>6 Grief with Agnes Martin</p>
<p>If there were to be a patron artist of sadness, it might be the American abstract painter Agnes Martin. Over a long life (1912–2004), she produced hundreds of canvases, most of them 1.8 by 1.8 meters, showing not very much at all. From a distance, they can seem merely white or gray, though step nearer and you notice grid patterns hand-drawn in pencil, beneath which run horizontal bands of color, often a particular subtle shade of gray, green, blue, or pink. There is an invitation to slough off the normal superficiality of life and bathe in the void of emptiness. The effect is soothing and moving too. For reasons to be explored, we may want to start crying. The works can appear simple but their effects are anything but. “Simplicity is never simple,” she explained, having studied Zen Buddhism for many years and learned that encounters with little can be frightening, because they remind us of our own ultimate nothingness, which we otherwise escape through noise and frantic and purposeless activity. “Simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve, from the standpoint of the East. I’m not sure the West even understands simplicity.”</p>
<p>In the little town of Taos, in the north-central region of New Mexico, where Martin spent her last years, one can visit the Agnes Martin Gallery, an octagonal room empty except for seven of her paintings and four steel cubes by her friend and fellow minimalist artist Donald Judd. We know how far we generally drift from what is important, how often we lose ourselves in meaningless chatter or attempts to assert our interests. The paintings bid us throw aside our customary, relentless self-promotion. It is just us and the sound of our own heartbeat, the light coming in from an oculus above—across which a New Mexico cloud occasionally drifts—the patient work of thousands of hand-drawn grids repetitively punctuated by strips of the mildest hues of gray and pink, and the peace there would have been over the oceans when the Earth was first created. Martin once remarked that her work was fundamentally about love, not the noisy, exuberant, romantic kind, but the selfless, patient sort a parent might feel for their sleeping newborn or a gardener might experience in relation to their seedlings.</p>
<p>Agnes Martin Gallery at the Harwood Museum in Taos, New Mexico, on March 20, 2022.</p>
<p>The German early twentieth-century art historian Wilhelm Worringer proposed that humanity had across history tended to make art of two kinds: abstract and realistic. On the one hand, there was an art of geometric non-concrete patterns—the abstraction one might see on a Navajo rug, a Persian mosque wall, or a Peruvian basket—and on the other, there was art made up of depictions of people, things and places—lions in prehistoric caves, mountain landscapes, battle scenes. Worringer made an additional suggestion. What determines the sort of art a society is drawn to at a given moment is often the degree of chaos, difficulty, and struggle to which that society is subject. The more cacophonous it is, the more it tends to be attracted to the serenity and peace implied by the sober repetition of geometric patterns, just as quieter eras may seek out new vigor in bold images of mounted generals or waterfalls. We attempt to correct via art imbalances in our own emotional economy.</p>
<p>By implication, we shouldn’t suppose that Agnes Martin was herself anything like the peaceful canvases she turned out. When still a young woman, she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffered from repeated bouts of extreme depression. She would often hear voices in her head criticizing her and urging her to take her own life. It could be hell inside her mind. It is understandable that she might as an artist have felt compelled to produce some of the most serene works the world has ever known, that she gained boundless relief from spending hours—and overall decades—alone in a simple house on the edge of the New Mexico desert, listening to Bach and Beethoven, tracing grids on canvases and applying paint in colors that Zen Buddhism identifies with the renunciation of the ego and the alignment of the self with cosmic harmony.</p>
<p>Agnes Martin, Little Sister, 1962.</p>
<p>If we are moved, if we are tempted to start crying, it’s not because our lives are themselves extremely serene. It’s because—like the artist herself—we have for far too long been familiar with mental perturbation, because we know what it means to have inner voices insisting on our worthlessness and how right one might be to die. Martin matters because she gives dignity to a longing for something infinitely more harmonious and loving than the world can generally offer. The canvases are like a map to a destination we have lost sight of and can’t get back to. They are our Ithaca. We might point to them and say that this is where we belong, this is the repository of everything we prize but have too fragile a hold on. The paintings lend us the courage to cut ourselves free from our unhealthy attachments, to say goodbye to concerns for status, to shun the pursuit of public esteem, to dismiss false friends who do us nothing but underhand harm, to accept the terror of disgrace, to reconcile ourselves to our own company, and to pursue connections with just a very few honest souls who have known struggles and been rendered kind by them. The paintings are what we could be if we sat with our own feelings and let their range course through us, if we gave up using our clever minds to ward off sadness and stopped trying to make sense of every experience, if we made our peace with mystery and the encroaching darkness that will soon subsume us.</p>
<p>Agnes Martin, Untitled, 1974.</p>
<p>Nowadays, by the typically perverse accidents of the art market, Agnes Martin’s paintings cost as much as planes. They can only generally be seen in bustling public museums. In a better world, we’d all be able to own a few. As it is, we can at least spend time with them in high-quality online versions and printed reproductions. They are sad pictures, in the best of ways. They know of our troubles, they understand how much we long for tenderness yet how rough everything has been day to day, and they want us to have the simplicity of little children and the hearts of wise old people who have stopped protesting and started to welcome experience. The titles that Martin gave her paintings indicate some of what she was getting at: Loving Love, Gratitude, Friendship, and, best of all, I Love the Whole World, which implies the sort of love one experiences not when everything has been hunky-dory, but when one has after the longest time come through from the other side of agony.</p>
<p>We can follow the grids and be happy. There’s one rectangle after another, one dot after another, nothing more troubling than lines of gray and white, no more surprises and departures, nothing unforeseen or cruel, only Martin’s careful pencil, riding along the little bumps that tremble beneath unprimed canvas. It’s as if she’s guiding us step by step, as we might a small child or a very old person, from square to square, making the world more manageable again, reducing its strident, clattery riot to something we can ingest. She’s cutting up the food of life for us into very neat and precise squares. She knows how unsteady we have felt. Occasionally, after a lot of grays, she goes for a pink, as if to hell with reserve, why not surrender to sweetness and take a risk with innocence? She’s giving us a hug and inviting us to come to the window to watch a new day with her through her frame.</p>
<p>To those who don’t see anything in her work, let’s hope that life won’t teach its lessons too painfully. To everyone else, her work will feel like a homecoming. We will know that someone else has understood, has been as ill and has been committed to hope, endurance, and kindness.</p>

<p>7 Cakes and Happiness</p>
<p>Wayne Thiebaud isn’t being sarcastic or elaborately sly. This isn’t a sophisticated mockery of ordinary appetites, or a nod to pop art—a movement he disliked. He just deeply adored confectionery. His mother had been a great baker and he was an excellent cook himself. When he went to Paris, his first destinations were not the Louvre or the Jeu de Paume, but Stohrer and Angelina’s—and his favorite works were not Rembrandts and Van Goghs, but canelés and brioches, eclairs and roses des sables. Across a long career, he painted German chocolate cakes and king cakes, devil’s food cake and baked Alaskas. He took us into the delights of buckeyes and Indiana sugar cream pies, banana puddings and snickerdoodles. In his 1963 Cakes, his precise, frank brushwork conjured up meringue and cream, icing sugar and melted chocolate.</p>
<p>When lying on our deathbeds, there will really be only two lovely things we will wish we had had more of. The other one is cakes. Our large and sophisticated brains do us a disservice when they lead us to forget how much the principal pleasures of life do not originate in their folds and downplay how much fun will ultimately need to come from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Wayne Thiebaud, Cakes, 1963.</p>
<p>We are understandably wary of “escapism.” We like our pleasures to be allied to grand, rationally founded, and enduring schemes: marriage and professional advancement, children and local politics. It appears demeaning to ask confectionery to provide us with one of the central constituents of the meaning of existence. But we should not fool ourselves. Most of what we scheme for in our clever minds will not come off; most of our sober larger hopes will not be realized. Friends will let us down, love will disappoint us, careers will go off at half-cock.</p>
<p>Thiebaud’s art knows as much—and our stomachs concur. It is a superior form of intelligence to know the limits of intelligence; part of good thinking involves knowing when to stop thinking. To overlook the role of mille-feuilles and strawberry tartlets in underpinning contentment is a cold-hearted and senseless mistake. Great artists have always remembered to celebrate the real reasons to keep living.</p>
<p>8 Seizing Melons</p>
<p>Between 1973 and 1979, Stephen Shore made six trips across the United States, clocking up tens of thousands of miles along the way. What the photographer wanted to find and capture through his lens was nothing less than the idea of “America” in all its troubled glory, alienation, beauty, and horror. There were to be hundreds of pictures, many of them iconic and known even to those who have made no effort to know them.</p>
<p>But perhaps his most resonant image was taken by chance in the tiny town of Kanab in southern Utah in a diner—it still exists—early one summer morning in 1973. Sitting in the Trail’s End Restaurant contemplating his just-arrived order of a plate of stacked pancakes lathered with foamy butter, a brim-full glass of cold milk, and half a shiny cantaloupe melon, Shore was struck by the sheer beauty and ecstasy of it all and, in a state of delight, with the manager’s permission, stood up on a chair, pointed his 35mm Leica downward and captured an enduring testament to the sensory pleasures of life.</p>
<p>It doesn’t feel coincidental that Shore was on a long journey and that he was in search of something large and intangible. In this respect, most of us are a version of him—though our destinations have names like “contentment” and “achievement.” We dream of reaching a promised land where anxiety, restless questioning, and uncertainty will be at an end.</p>
<p>Stephen Shore, Breakfast, Trail’s End Restaurant, Kanab, Utah, August 10, 1973, 1973.</p>
<p>But we will, of course, never arrive. There is no true destination and there is definitely no end point. All there is is the journey—an idea which, though it has its tragic dimension, liberates us to make more of the true valuable increments of life: moments.</p>
<p>Without any promised land, there will be unexpected moments of pure joy, instances of total, albeit fleeting, wonder. Our happiness must be counted in minutes, not years. But when those moments sneak up on us, we should be wise and old enough to embrace them as avidly as a child might, pushing back our chair, beholding them with awe and fixing them in our memory for ever.</p>
<p>9 Wise Cows</p>
<p>The mountains weren’t made to deliver a message to us. No one created them to articulate a philosophy. But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t exceptionally well placed to do so—especially when framed through the talent of the Swiss artist Ferdinand Hodler, one of the greatest painters of any place and of any age.</p>
<p>We’re looking up at the seven interconnected peaks of the Dents du Midi range, which rises in an almost sheer vertical up to 3,000 meters from the fertile valley floor of Switzerland’s Valais region, creating an astonishing, impassable wall of granite capped for six months of the year with layers of ice and snow visited only by the occasional griffon vulture and marmot.</p>
<p>So much of our upset stems from being belittled by a world that refuses to accord us the respect and recognition we know should be our due. One way to appease our bruised sense of importance is to be made to feel small with definitive and magisterial force by something obviously mightier than any human. Our sense that we have been overlooked and treated badly by our fellow citizens can be subsumed by an impression of how petty and insignificant all our society’s endeavors are next to the indomitable forces of nature, of which the peaks, created 60 million years ago by the titanic rippling of the Earth’s crust in the continental collision, are an especially impressive symbol. It matters ever so slightly less, in the shadow of the peaks, that our projects were rejected and our reputation sullied, that we have recently rowed bitterly with our partner and been misunderstood by so-called friends.</p>
<p>The real stars of Hodler’s painting among his last; he died two years later—are not the mountains at all, but the three clever cows that he has carefully observed on the edge of a field. They care nothing for us and—with equal boldness—nothing for the spectacular scenery either. They are exclusively focused on finding their next mouthful of grass and enjoying the warming rays of the August sun. The follies that agitate us have no analogies in their hearts. They are not scholars or monks but, through the good fortune of their biological makeup, have already reached the state of benign indifference and serene acceptance of fate that the wisest of humans struggle to attain after a lifetime of devoted effort.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Hodler, The Dents du Midi from Champéry, 1916.</p>
<p>10 Healing Love</p>
<p>There’s some kind of story going on, a very lovely one, but we can’t know the details for certain. We are, in this respect, standing outside a window ourselves—in the most agreeable of ways. What we can guess with some accuracy is that the relationship is an extremely kindly and tender one. This is Granny, Mommy, Nanny, or Auntie—and just beyond the window, through those thin, delicate panes of seventeenth-century Dutch glass, there is little Maries, Annelies, Sofie, or Wilma. Maybe it’s a game: I’ll run outside and wave to you and your job is to wave back. Or: You cover your eyes, I’ll duck beneath the window, give a little tap and then you have to rush to spot me before I drop down again. Or, more simply: When I have to go home after a day with you, I miss you so much and I like to say goodbye many times, four times in the room, twice from the hallway and then once again at the window.</p>
<p>In other words, in some undefined way, this is a portrait of love. An adult, probably quite a serious one who has known many cares and has considerable responsibilities, is bending to the sweet and imaginative will of a small person, in whose reflection she sees a version of herself. Vrel hints that the window is a mirror: the old woman gazing at a version of her younger self. A grown-up who could so easily have humiliated the child—said she was busy or that it was all too silly—is joining in enthusiastically and giving the ritual or game her all, to the extent that she might even fall off her chair.</p>
<p>Jacob Vrel, Woman at a Window, Waving at a Girl, c. 1650.</p>
<p>One of the unexpected origins of something as serious and consequential as adult mental health arguably begins right here. If we find ourselves as grown-ups feeling creative, knowing how to appreciate ourselves, understanding how to remain calm, and ready to give affection to others, it is almost certainly because at some point, a long way back, someone did for us what the woman in Vrel’s painting is doing for the little girl: gave us attention, made us the focus of tenderness, appreciated us on our own modest but vital terms.</p>
<p>Children who end up sane have been spared the need to be very good or very reasonable too early. We can’t know much about the economic status of Vrel’s figures. What we do know is that such games and the love behind them belong to what it really means to have had that most invaluable of things: a privileged childhood.</p>
<p>11 I’m Not Getting in the Car</p>
<p>It was the summer of 1963 and Joel Meyerowitz was walking the streets of New York City with his M10 when, on the Upper East Side, somewhere around 76th and Madison, he came across a girl whose name we will never know having one of the worst mornings of her young life. The wails resounded all around the brownstones. No, she wasn’t getting in. No, she didn’t care about what the time was. No, she wasn’t going to listen. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Part of what makes young children’s lives so difficult is that they have extremely powerful antipathies, worries, loves, and dreads that make no immediate sense to grown-ups because children lack the language or wherewithal to be able to explain them with requisite adequacy. Their feelings are an outgrowth of the manic sensitivity, unconfined intelligence, and wild imagination of the infantile mind. Small people are, in the best and most inspiring of ways, slightly mad.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that perhaps the girl doesn’t want to get inside because she really doesn’t like the way the car looks. She hates the dark orange paintwork of its upper body; it reminds her of the color of a house she once had to go into where another girl said something extremely mean to her about her hair. Or maybe she doesn’t want to get inside because the driver makes an odd noise when he swallows or because there’s a strange smell in the toilets at school or because she’s been forbidden from taking her soft rabbit with her and she doesn’t want Floppy to spend all day alone with Maria in the apartment staring at the wall and getting bored. But because all this is so hard to explain, most children simply end up screaming, then being labeled “spoilt” or “difficult.”</p>
<p>The child and the artist are in a sense in a very similar predicament: both are uncommonly sensitive, both notice and are marked by “small things” that it’s easy to overlook or denigrate. Both might spend an age looking at a sidewalk, a flower, or a conker. But artists are in a luckier position: They can bring to the sensitivities of a child the powers of communication of a robust and ingenious adult. They can turn their tears into pictures and essays.</p>
<p>With their examples in mind, we should strive not so much to become less sensitive as to grow better able to convey what we are sensitive about, so that we will have a slightly better chance of being understood even by people who are in a very great hurry to get us into the car.</p>
<p>Joel Meyerowitz, New York City, 1963.</p>
<p>12 What Remains</p>
<p>She should, it seems, have so little to be happy about. She’s only got a few months left to live, she had to sell her bungalow after the diagnosis, both of her knees are giving her trouble, she can’t hear anything in her left ear, she’s seen too many of her close friends die. And yet, extraordinarily, she is smiling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, though it sounds strange, she’s happier now than she was a while ago, when she ostensibly had so much more to feel happy about, when she could run and hear a pin drop. She’s certainly happier than she was at twenty, when she was deciding between Vincent and Albert; or when she was forty, and the kids were teenagers; or after the marriage fell apart and she moved to a small place outside Lille on her own.</p>
<p>All the worries have faded into the background. She is living—as certain Eastern sages have always recommended—entirely in the present. She doesn’t look much beyond tomorrow. She is surprised and amazed to have made it until the spring. She studies everything with patience and wonder. How extraordinary a rose is, she thinks, with the glee of a young child—one of the nurses brought it for her after her daughter mentioned the garden she had left behind. She had never been too interested in flowers until she was sixty. Then they started to matter a lot. By that time, all her larger aspirations had faded; she knew full well about the gap between her hopes and the available realities. So then flowers were no longer an insult to ambition, but a genuine pleasure amid a litany of troubles, a small resting place for hope in a turbulent sea of disappointment.</p>
<p>She doesn’t care about the so-called big things any more. When the politicians argue on television, she looks away. She has seen so many babies turn into old men, and brilliant young things fade into nothing. She doesn’t worry about what will happen to the planet or get excited about what the scientists might discover. If you visit her, she just wants to know how you are and whether you might be cold or after something to drink. She’s happy that you exist and that she can put her hand on yours.</p>
<p>In the end, all we will care about will be kindness. We should—with the help of the right art—learn a little ahead of time.</p>

<p>13 Hockney’s First Day</p>
<p>In 1963, the Sunday Times sent the already much celebrated 26-year-old artist David Hockney to Egypt on an assignment to record the great monuments of antiquity: the pyramids outside Cairo, the temples at Luxor and Karnak, and the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Egypt astonished Hockney and induced in him a state of almost perpetual creativity where everything seemed to hold a secret, everything was worthy of investigation and reflection. He sketched on whatever was to hand: old envelopes, hotel room notepaper, and the inside covers of his books. However, what struck him most were not the obvious tourist destinations so much as the details of ordinary Egyptian life: the watch of the man at reception, the sandals of the newspaper seller, the signs for the dry cleaner, and the television repair shop.</p>
<p>On arrival in Alexandria, Hockney sat on the terrace of the Hotel Cecil and very carefully drew the label on a bottle of local mineral water from the El Natroon valley and a packet of cigarettes. In its delicacy and observational precision—Hockney knew no Arabic—this astonishing study of a bottle might be an emblem of what it means to be properly attuned to a place: to put aside our usual cares and surrender to the interest and beauty of the world, as a child might, as artists will—and as we almost never do.</p>
<p>David Hockney, Waiter, Alexandria, 1963.</p>
<p>Generally, we tend to notice nothing, but we may make an exception for one particular time and place: the first day in a new destination. There and then, for once, we too may be shaken from our customary lethargy. Everything leaps out at us: how peculiar the taxis are, the smells in the street, the sound of passers-by, the clothes of the old. Our eyes open properly, as they last did when we were two years old and it took us half an hour to get home from the park because there was so much for us to study on the way.</p>
<p>This state is unlikely to last long. After a few days, we usually go back to our habitual blindness. But even if we manage it for only a short while, the receptivity of that first day remains a possibility that we should strive to enact more regularly and generously, even in places closer to home. We shouldn’t need another continent to start to appreciate the texture of existence. We knew how to do so as a small one and we might do so again. Artists are in this context only the emissaries of an appropriately appreciative relationship to the world of which we are all in theory capable.</p>
<p>Our travels have an overwhelming lesson to teach us: that we need whenever we can to try to look at our lives, with which it is so easy to get dispirited and about which it is so forgivable to despair, as though we were still in some ways on that hopeful, endlessly fascinating first day somewhere else, when even a label on a bottle of water has something important to whisper to us.</p>
<p>14 The Greatest Artist</p>
<p>This is a self-portrait by one of the greatest artists of the twenty-first century, a car-shaped contraption named Curiosity which has been moving around at a glacial pace—it would take an hour for it to complete a hundred-meter sprint over the surface of Mars since its bumpy landing there in a cloud of dust on August 6, 2012, following a 560-million-kilometer journey from Earth.</p>
<p>Curiosity has ostensibly come to Mars in order to find out more about the planet’s biological and geochemical properties. It’s been trying to understand Mars’s organic carbon compounds; it’s been figuring out the relative proportions of sulfur, carbon, hydrogen, and phosphorus in the atmosphere. It’s been mapping isotopic composition and measuring the spectrum of radiation, with a special interest in secondary neutrons and solar proton events.</p>
<p>But regardless of the stated purpose, what Curiosity has really been trying to do is to help our marriages, calm our anger with our colleagues, appease our disappointments, and bolster our capacities for calm and perspective. No one can look at any of the images it has sent back without a sense of awe that at once relativizes everything petty and regrettable that agitates and demeans us day to day. What can it possibly matter who said what to whom and in what tone of voice given that Curiosity has captured the sun going down at six in the evening below the rim of Gale Crater? Or that its mast camera has just sent thirty-two individual images that it has assembled into a panorama of a Martian outcrop nicknamed Mont Mercou?</p>

<p>The machine also reminds us of the beauty of our own planet. The bleakness of Mars emphasizes the lushness of our own world. Pictures of this far-off place we will probably never go to ourselves can inspire wonder and gratitude for where we are already.</p>
<p>Like all great artists, and with comparable technical ingenuity, Curiosity has attempted to help us change our lives, away from superficiality and bitterness toward goodness, wisdom, and truth.</p>
