            <h3>¶ Anxiety</h3>
<p>Anxiety is not a sign of sickness, a weakness of the mind or an error to which we should always locate a medical solution. It is mostly a reasonable and sensitive response to the genuine strangeness, terror, uncertainty and riskiness of existence.</p>
<p>Anxiety is our fundamental state for well-founded reasons: because we are intensely vulnerable physical beings, a complicated network of fragile organs all biding their time before letting us down catastrophically at a moment of their own choosing. Because we have insufficient information upon which to make most major life decisions. Because we can imagine so much more than we have, and live in ambitious mediatised societies where envy and restlessness are constant. Because we are the descendants of the great worriers of the species, the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals, and because we still carry in our DNA – into the calm of the suburbs – the terrors of the savannah. Because the progress of our careers and of our finances plays out within the tough-minded, competitive, destructive, random workings of an uncontained economic engine. Because we rely for our self-esteem and sense of comfort on the love of people we cannot control and whose needs and hopes will never align seamlessly with our own.</p>
<p>All of which is not to say that there aren’t better and worse ways to approach our condition. The single most important move is acceptance. There is no need to be anxious that we are anxious on top of everything else. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong; merely that we are alive. We should also be more careful when pursuing things we imagine will spare us anxiety. We can head to them by all means, but for other reasons than fantasies of calm – and with a little less vigour and a little more scepticism. We will still be anxious when we finally have the house, the love affair and the right income.</p>
<p>We should spare ourselves the burden of loneliness. We are far from the only ones with this problem. Everyone is more anxious than they are inclined to tell us. Even the tycoon and the couple in love are suffering. We have collectively failed to admit to ourselves how much we panic.</p>
<p>We must learn to laugh about our anxieties – laughter being the exuberant expression of relief when a hitherto private agony is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke. We must suffer alone. But we can at least hold out our arms to our similarly tortured, fractured, and above all else, anxious neighbours, as if to say, in the kindest way possible: ‘I know…’</p>
<p>Anxiety deserves greater dignity. It is not a sign of degeneracy. It is a kind of masterpiece of insight: a justifiable expression of our mysterious participation in a disordered, uncertain world.</p>
