        <h1>The Comfort-Zone Exercise</h1>
<p>Get a large piece of plain paper and draw a circle in the middle. Inside the circle write examples of activities that you feel completely comfortable doing. Around the edge of the circle write down examples of activities that you can do but that you have to push yourself a little bit to do – those activities that may make you nervous in some way, but not so much as to stop you doing them. Draw a larger circle around this circle of activities. In the next band write activities that you would like to do but find it difficult to get up the courage to do. Draw another circle around this ring of activities. After that write down those things you are far too scared to try but would like to do. You can create as many circles as you like.</p>
<p>It is useful to consider what we are comfortable with and what we are not, and then to experiment with expanding our area of comfort. We should remember that whatever we try is for ourselves alone. It does not matter what anyone else might think. The idea is to expand our comfort-zone in small steps. We go beyond ‘good stress’ into ‘bad stress’ if we attempt too big a leap across zones. When I started to push out my inner circle to gradually include the other zones I felt more confident about all the challenges within that original inner zone. I also found that when I set myself a do-able challenge and succeeded my self-esteem and self-confidence rose in all areas. The greatest leap I made was when I went from not being able to run 100 yards to completing the London Marathon. I am sure this is what gave me the confidence to go on submitting my book, Couch Fiction, after its first round of rejections. It was eventually published in May 2010. I have also experienced that if I do not keep on testing my limits, my comfort-zone shrinks back. Challenges that had seemed comfortable one year took courage to achieve the next. I do not want to get into that position again; so, onwards and outwards.</p>
