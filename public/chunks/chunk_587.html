        <h3>¶ Envy</h3>
<p>Envy has been so taboo for so long – at least two thousand years – that some of us are tempted to claim that we ‘never feel envy’. Such a pronouncement is psychologically impossible. Envy is a fundamental fact for all of us. The trick isn’t simply to suffer from it, but to learn from it.</p>
<p>Envy matters because it can provide us with a host of insights into our potential, our passions and our interests. Every time we envy someone, we are encountering a clue as to who we want to be deep down – and in part probably could be. We don’t envy everyone. We envy those who we feel have what we deserve, what we are interested in, and what we could perhaps attain one day. Every person we envy contains suggestions as to our future possible selves.</p>
<p>The real problem isn’t that we feel envy, but that we envy in such unexamined and fruitless ways. Firstly, we feel deeply embarrassed by our envy, and so tend to hide the emotion from our conscious selves. Secondly, we don’t have faith that there is anything to be learnt from envy, and so we hope the mood will pass, like a vicious fever.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we start to envy certain individuals in their entirety, when, if we took a moment to analyse their lives calmly, we would realise that it was only a small part of what they had done that really resonated with, and could guide, our own next steps. It might not be the whole of the restaurant entrepreneur’s life we wanted, but really just their skill at building up institutions. We might not truly want to be a potter, yet we might need a little more of the playfulness on display in the work of one example we read about in a supplement.</p>
<p>The more we drill into our envy, the less attached we need to be to the actual lives of the people who triggered it.</p>
<p>The qualities we admire don’t just belong to the very specific, very attractive locations in which we discovered them. These qualities can be pursued in lesser, weaker (but still real) doses in countless other places, opening up the possibility of creating many smaller, more manageable and more realistic versions of the lives we admire.</p>
