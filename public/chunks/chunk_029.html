            <h3>¶ Better Porn</h3>
<p>The idea of good porn can seem paradoxical. Many of us are used to thinking of all porn as ‘bad’. Yet when people eat badly, we don’t try to stop them eating at all. We hope to improve their diet. The aim isn’t to abolish food just because some food is terrible. We want good food to be more widely and easily available. The same move could apply to online sex sites. We can’t abolish porn, so the goal is to get good pornography.</p>
<p>Better porn isn’t even more thrilling or exciting. It is ‘better’ in the sense of being less at odds with the rest of our lives. It isn’t merely about sex, but also about other things we care about, like self-understanding, kindness, intelligence and good relationships. Unfortunately, we have left porn largely in the hands of people who don’t seem to be interested in anything much apart from sex. Better porn would reconnect sexuality with other parts of our lives.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t be negative about porn just because of how most of it seems today. In 1800, many people offering medical services were quacks. They didn’t know what they were doing. There was a hunger for remedies, however misguided. So ‘being a doctor’ was nothing like the respectable career choice it is today. What changed was the realisation that we needed really serious, thoughtful and honourable people to go into the medical field. Health was too important to be left to self-appointed peddlers of fanciful potions.</p>
<p>We are hugely aware of the things that can go wrong around porn in the internet age. But the longing for sexual stimulation isn’t going to go away. Given how vast the demand is, and how crucial the role of sexuality is in life, it is tragic that comparatively so little talent, wisdom, intelligence, maturity and aesthetic imagination has been directed to it. We’ve rightly come to fear bad porn because it damages so many lives. Good porn could help us deal a little better with the complex, tricky fact of being at the same time highly sexual and highly reasonable beings.</p>
