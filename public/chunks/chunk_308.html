        <h3>9 Speed</h3>
<p>For most of history, our maximum speed was set by the constraints of our own feet, or at best, the velocity of a horse or a sailing ship. It might take three weeks to tramp from London to Edinburgh; four months to sail from Southampton to Sydney. In eighteenth-century Spain, the majority of people died within twenty-five kilometres of where they had been born. Now, nowhere is further than twenty-six hours away and the Voyager 1 probe is hurtling at seventeen kilometres per second, 21.2 billion kilometres away from its launch planet, on its way to explore interstellar space.</p>
<p>Andreas Gursky, May Day V, 2006.</p>
<p>Much of the transformation of modernity has been exciting; thrilling, even. Fibre-optic cables ring the Earth, satellites guide us across cities, new ideas overthrow rigid assumptions, airports are conjured from the ground and colossal energies are unleashed by the Promethean forces of chemistry and physics. The word ‘modern’ still suggests a state of glamour, desire and aspiration.</p>
<p>But at the same time the advent of modernity has been a story of tragedy. We have bought our new freedoms at a very high price. We have never been so close to collective insanity or planetary extinction. Modernity has wreaked havoc on our inner and outer landscapes. We can pick up on aspects of the catastrophe in seven areas.</p>
