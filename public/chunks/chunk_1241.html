        <h2>Terra Incognita</h2>
<p>When we’re travelling around the world, it helps hugely to use maps that have accurately and comprehensively worked out the real features of the landscape. When we’re more broadly going around our minds, it can be just as helpful to encounter maps that have holes in them: maps where not everything is fixed, maps that allow for surprising and unusual speculations, maps with time for the odd monster or unicorn, maps with unknown regions left on them, maps that appreciate how badly we need to have some ‘terra incognita’ left to play in.</p>
<p>One of the more inspiring maps in this regard was completed in 1587 by the Italian geographer Urbano Monte. Even though he spent fifteen years on the map and consulted with hundreds of travellers and sailors in order to draw it, it is beautifully and touchingly ‘wrong’ about a great many things. Australia is an extended lump off Antarctica, Japan is almost joined up with Alaska, the estuary of the Amazon is seven times its real size, there’s deep confusion around the scale of the Indonesian islands. There are fantastical creatures dotted everywhere: mermaids off the Gulf of California, flamingo-like birds in Tierra del Fuego, giant bearded men wrestling with one another in the Andes, rhino-like beasts marauding through Namibia — and lots of unicorns here and there. And then, where even Monte’s imagination runs out, he simply puts in clumps of (European) trees, flowers and scatterings of apologetic ‘terrae incognitae’.</p>
<p>The map would be a mess to use to sail around the globe, but it’s a delight to contemplate, in part because we are so asphyxiated day to day by how much appears to be known and is alleged to be immovable. This is the way we’re meant to educate children, this is how relationships are supposed to be, this is the sort of job it is correct to have… Yet, in truth, a vast amount remains utterly unforeseen, not around maps, but in existence as a whole. We struggle to know what our collective purpose should be, we can’t securely grasp what we’re trying to be educated in and for, the ultimate aim of increased wealth is opaque, no one understands how relationships work and why they simply don’t most of the time, loneliness and fear remain endemic. Technology can’t deliver much of what we would want of it; the human animal appears as demented, restless and unkind as it ever was.</p>
<p>How useful, therefore, to let a very old and wonky map make a point in visual form that we have trouble holding on to as an idea in our minds: that no one really knows. They know bits, here and there. But in key areas, where it can really count, there is a remarkable original ignorance still at play, an insight as frightening as it is emancipating. We don’t continually have to subscribe to authority. We don’t have to believe in experts in areas where there aren’t any. We can trust more in our own minds and give greater credence to certain of our authentic wishes. Monte’s unicorns and misshapen continents are, despite their quirks, directing us with great accuracy to an actual destination: a place where we understand that we are a lot more free than we thought we were.</p>
