        <h3>¶ Appreciation</h3>
<p>At the centre of our societies is a hugely inventive force dedicated to nudging us towards a heightened appreciation of certain aspects of the world. With enormous skill, it throws into relief the very best sides of particular places and objects. It uses wordsmiths and image-makers of near-genius, who create deeply inspiring and beguiling associations – and it positions works close to our eyelines at most moments of the day.</p>
<p>Advertising is the most compelling agent of mass appreciation the world has ever known. It hones our sensitivity to the elegant styling of a car bonnet or to the niceties of design around training shoes; we become acutely receptive to the personalities of handbags or sunglasses. Because advertising is ubiquitous, it can be easy to forget that only a limited range of things ever get advertised; only a limited range of products can support the budgets for prominent advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Christen Købke, Morning Light, 1836.</p>
<p>This Danish artist brought touching awareness to an often-underappreciated subject: cloudy skies.</p>
<p>One of the tasks of art is to teach us appreciation of many other important things. In the 1830s, the Danish artist Christen Købke did a lot of advertising for the sky, especially just before or after a rain shower.</p>
<p>His ‘product’ was, in effect, rain clouds, whose market share of love he felt was disappointing, like a delicious biscuit that hadn’t yet found its market. Obviously, he wasn’t trying to get us to buy a cloud. But, just like an advertiser, he wanted us to be much more sensitive than we normally are to the charms of grey skies; how they go so nicely with small patches of sunlight; how they enhance a quiet moment in a busy day; how they can make the ordinary feel special. Under his guidance, we are sensitised to different kinds of cloud: some are attractively independent, some fluffy and light, others massy and assertive.</p>
<p>Other works of art might advertise kindness or melancholy; the loveliness of trees or night-time walks; going to bed early, or making a heartfelt apology.</p>
<p>Art is advertising for the things that really matter, but that aren’t usually for sale.</p>
