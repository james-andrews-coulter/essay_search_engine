        <h3>Laughter</h3>
<p>To lie like this would mean to laugh a lot more often. There are good reasons why an ability to laugh is one of the most sought-after qualities in a prospective partner. It’s not idle japes we’re looking for. We want, first and foremost, someone who can laugh at themselves, someone who can see their own ridiculousness and admit to it with grace. And we need to do likewise.</p>
<p>Laughter occupies the zone between our hopes and the available reality. It is the best possible response to the difference between the way we want things to be and the complicated way they actually are. To make a joke, all we ever need to do is to look at one of our hopes and compare it with what life has truly delivered. I wanted to be happy forever, then I met your parents. I used to think I was easy going, then I opened one of your cupboards. I thought people who strayed were evil, then I swore to be eternally faithful. We can add in entries ad infinitum.</p>
<p>How we wanted it to be</p>
