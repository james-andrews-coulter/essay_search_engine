            <h3>¶ Self-Sabotage</h3>
<p>It is normal to expect that we will always actively seek out our own happiness in relationships and careers, yet we often act as if we were deliberately out to ruin our chances. When going on dates, we may lapse into unnecessarily opinionated and antagonistic behaviour. In relationships, we may drive well-intentioned partners to distraction through repeated unwarranted accusations and angry explosions. At work, we may stumble before the biggest chances.</p>
<p>Such behaviour can’t always be put down to mere bad luck. It may deserve a stronger, more intentional term: Self-Sabotage. We destroy our opportunities because of a background sense that success is undeserved; this breeds a compulsion to bring our outer reality into line with our inner one, so that we end up being as unsuccessful as we feel.</p>
<p>Hope is hard for self-saboteurs to endure. It may feel internally easier to destroy one’s happiness oneself, at a time of one’s own choosing, rather than to wait for circumstances to do the trick for one (as they surely will), when one is unprotected and trusting. Failing feels grim but – at least – safely grim.</p>
<p>Our sense of what we deserve emerges from childhood. When we carry about with us a legacy of not quite having a right to satisfaction, the good will of others may prove bewildering and inspire unconscious attempts to repel or disappoint it self-destructively. It will simply feel more normal and therefore comfortable to be disliked or ignored.</p>
<p>Or we may, when we were younger, have been exposed to exceptionally brutal disappointments at a time when we were too fragile to withstand them. Perhaps we hoped our parents would stay together and they didn’t. Or we hoped our father would eventually come back from another country and he stayed away. Perhaps we dared to love an adult and, after a period of happiness, they swiftly and oddly changed their attitude and let us down. Somewhere in our characters, a deep association has been forged between hope and danger, along with a corresponding preference to live quietly with disappointment, rather than more freely with hope.</p>
<p>The solution is to remind ourselves that we can, despite our fears, survive the loss of hope. We are no longer those who suffered the disappointments responsible for our present timidity. The conditions that forged our caution are no longer those of adult reality. The unconscious mind may, as is its wont, be reading the present through the lenses of decades ago, but what we fear will happen has in truth already happened; we are projecting into the future a catastrophe that belongs to a past we have not had the chance to fathom and mourn adequately.</p>
<p>We are suffering from an enduring localised immaturity: an archaic part of us remains as it was when we were young. It has not been able to grow and shed its terrors. The intensity of fear is based on the idea that we can only bring childhood resources to the problem. We still feel the same age as when we met a horrendous loss.</p>
<p>But in fact, we’re big now. We have the capacity to cope very well. Should this relationship fail, should this job not work out, should our hopes not be met, we’ll be sad for a while but won’t be destroyed. We are not in as much danger as the primitive part of the mind thinks – and as we once were. The catastrophe is behind us.</p>
<p>If happiness has not been a big part of our history, we should be conscious of how hard or unnerving it may prove to get close to some of the things we truly want.</p>
