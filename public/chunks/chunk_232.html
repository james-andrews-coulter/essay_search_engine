            <h3>An attractive mindset</h3>
<p>Our societies pay vast attention to the idea of ‘sexiness’. Far more questionably, they tempt us to believe that it might be easy to understand what this quality consists of. The leading suggestion takes its starting point from the biological sciences: we learn that sex aims at successful reproduction and genetic fitness in the coming generation. Therefore, ‘sexiness’ must logically comprise a host of semi-conscious signals of fertility and of resistance to disease: bilateral facial symmetry; large, bright pupils; full lips; youthful skin and thick hair.</p>
<p>But this analysis too quickly assumes that it might be simple to know what sex really aims at. Unlike most other living beings, our biological drives sit alongside, and at points take second place to, a range of emotional priorities. Chief among these is the desire to overcome loneliness and share our vulnerability within the arms of a safe and intimate other. We seek, through a physical act, to overcome our customary psychological alienation and a host of painful barriers to being known and accepted. Viewed through such a lens, the erotic is not so much a promise of reproductive health as a suggestion of a redemptive capacity for closeness, connection and understanding, and an end to shame and isolation.</p>
<p>It is this emotional mission that explains the conundrum sometimes generated by people whom one would expect, by standard biological criteria, to possess an exemplary sexual aura, but who leave us cold – just as it may shed light on the associated puzzle of those physically more challenged candidates who nevertheless have a rare power that far outstrips the quality of their hair or the lustre of their eyes.</p>
<p>The people whom we call ‘sexy’ despite, or aside from, the raw facts of their appearance are those whose features and manner suggest an unusual ability to fulfil the underlying emotional purpose of lovemaking. The way they respond to a joke, the curve of an eyebrow, the characteristic motion of their forehead, the way of holding their hands all convey that one is in the presence of a kindly being who may understand our broken and confused aspects. They may help us over our loneliness and submerged sadness and reassure us of our basic legitimacy and worth; they are someone with whom we can reduce our normal suspicions, cast aside our armour and feel safe, playful and accepted. Whatever the quality of their skin or balance of their proportions, it is these aspects that have a true power to excite us; in a melancholy and avoidant world, this is the real turn-on.</p>
<p>We hear so much about what we might need to do to increase our physical appeal. But by getting more detailed about the psychological traits that drive desire, we could learn to pay as much, if not more, attention to the foundations of an exciting mindset. Armed with a broader understanding of the aims of sexuality, some of the following might also deserve to be counted as valuable sources of sexiness.</p>
