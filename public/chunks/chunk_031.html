            <h3>1. Friends in the sky</h3>
<p>For centuries, across vast swathes of the earth’s surface, a predominant share of the population has thought of their best and closest friends as people who – through the eyes of strictly secular observers – don’t exist.</p>
<p>In the third millennium BCE in Ancient Sumer, in what is now modern-day southern Iraq, one of the most popular friends one might have had was called Enki. A handsome, paternal man with a graceful face, a long beard and flowing robes, one could turn to him for advice on money, love and health, and he could be counted upon to respond with kindness, practical advice and sympathy.</p>
<p>In the Inca Empire, in what is now modern-day Peru, one’s best friend might have been Inti, who had a profound interest in human sorrows, especially those pertaining to matters of fertility and agriculture.</p>
<p>In Māori and Polynesian mythology, a central best friend was called Tangaroa, a god who kept a watchful eye over the sea and the creatures that live there, whom one could talk to about navigation and fishing, weather patterns and ocean currents.</p>
<p>The best of friends: ʻThe Lusenberg Virgin’ parish church of St Ulrich, Val Gardena, Italy</p>
<p>And for the world’s Catholics, Mary was the kindliest of friends, who was on hand for compassion and understanding, hope and intercession, motherly guidance and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Surveying the long history of faith-based imaginary friendships, atheists have tended to grow scornful, and even plain cross, at their fellow humans’ perceived credulity and naivety. What shallowness, they have said, to turn a statue into a friend, to imagine that a pleasant-looking woman with sad eyes on an altar might care about one’s marital woes or workplace struggles, to lie in bed and divulge one’s agonies to the ceiling, to enter into a passionate dialogue with a phantom.</p>
<p>But ultimately the least interesting move one can ever make in relation to supernatural beliefs is to question their veracity; attempting to prove religion wrong is no more fruitful a task than manically to try to convince others it must be right. The point isn’t to expend energy on showing how imaginary friends are necessarily ‘false’, but rather to explore the degree to which they can advance our self-understanding – affording us glimpses into manoeuvres of the psyche that remain invisible via a godless lens.</p>
<p>The religious tradition of imaginary friends attests to our remarkable capacity to split our minds in two: a speaker and a listener. We can thus talk to ourselves as if through the voice of another person in order to deliver the wisdom and sympathy that we crave and yet can’t find in suﬃcient doses in the world around us. This ability to project a best friend onto a statue or a painting, a tree trunk or a mountain – and to have regular recourse to such a friend in times of trouble – isn’t so much naivety or childishness as, in essence, a stroke of adaptive genius with a power at points to make the difference between hope and despair, life and death.</p>
<p>The experience of the religious unwittingly gives us a measure of the bravery required to lead the sort of secular lives that we are now – many of us – attempting to establish. We are amongst the first generations to try to endure the trials of existence without any imaginary friends whatsoever. We rely on the flesh-andblood types that we pick up at school, university, the squash club and on our apps, striving to survive psychically without appeal to a patient and kind being who understands how the universe works, who controls the tides and the crops, the sun and the moon, and to whom we can talk every night in a small, emotion-choked voice about our regrets and longings, our sexual dysfunction and business worries, our squabbles with our neighbours and our dread at our mortality. No wonder we secular types often feel horribly alone and even, in relation to believers, sometimes a little envious.</p>
<p>We may, despite lacking religiosity, still very much miss having companions in the sky. It may be unscientific to commune with such companions; it is also imaginative and psychologically helpful to do so.</p>
<p>And then perhaps, every now and then, when no one is looking, when the trial lawyer has adjourned our case or the doctor has told us they’ll call us in half an hour with the kidney results, we might give it a go. We too might turn to Enki or Inti, Tangaroa or Mary or versions thereof and explain that we are worried, that no one quite understands, that we are sorry for whatever mean things we’ve done, and might they please – if they have any mercy, if they can hear our cries and witness our tears – intercede a little with the universe to make sure we will, after all, be OK? This isn’t madness; it’s what friends are for.</p>
<ol>
<li>Soft toys</li>
</ol>
<p>No understanding of human love would be complete without consideration of the immense and detailed affection that smaller people – and often, privately, larger ones too – have long experienced for their stuffed animals: for bears with only one ear and fur worn down to bare patches by years of caresses; for lions with threadbare manes who have been the recipients of successive sorrows and entreaties; for rabbits who have kept vigils through sob-filled nights; for menageries-full of thoughtful and attentive hedgehogs and gerbils, manatees and hippos, mice and elephants, all of whom have in their different ways – when no one else was on hand – listened, reassured and sympathised.</p>
<p>We are apt to miss what emotional intelligence we are witnessing when, for example, we see a boy whose father is a bully taking a small, thoughtful-looking bear under his wing and anointing him as his ‘son’; when this boy puts the bear to bed carefully every night and tells it kind and hopeful stories; when the boy imagines the bear struggling to deal with a mean ‘uncle’, but explaining with a wisdom beyond his years that the bear doesn’t need to listen to this man’s silly taunts because he is probably just upset in some area of his life. We can admire the girl whose turtle has leukaemia, but who is sure it will get better with patience and one more operation because the doctors are kind and trying their very best. We can marvel at the way we know how to tell ourselves what we so badly need to hear through the voices of friends who are at once us and, as much as any god, powerfully alive in an independent sense as well.</p>
<p>We can admire our species too when the care goes the other way. When it’s Otter who delivers a thoughtful speech to a 6-yearold about needing to be strong about a school camping trip. When Panther is on hand to tell a boy mocked for his inability to play football that he will, in time, grow up to be popular and powerful. Or when a 43-year-old businessperson in charge of a twenty-strong team returns home from a day of stress at the oﬃce and turns to old Bernard the sheep for a cuddle and some very soothing words.</p>
<p>We are learning thereby, in effect, how to be better friends to ourselves. Our panic and distress don’t need to be overwhelming. There remains another side of us that can think of what to do, that can gently but clearly point out that our fears are exaggerated, that our setbacks are not final, that our troubles don’t have to define us.</p>
<p>Under the guise of play, our toys teach us the serious art of rebalancing ourselves. They help us to trust that, even when we are friendless, we can deliver to our own scared and sad minds the nutrients that we need to make it through to the other side. Later on, hamster and seal, bear and elephant morph into other things: literature and art, prayer and song – those alternative and more respectable-sounding psychological tools that soften our isolation and assist us through our disasters and losses. But it would be a gross ingratitude to our first teachers, our best friends and our guides to forget that it was they who were there when no one else was and that, in a corner of our minds, we continue to love them more than anyone who is alive in a more standard sense.</p>
<ol>
<li>Books</li>
</ol>
<p>We are apt to forget – amongst highbrow explanations of the function and role of literature – the more fundamental reasons why books exist and why they matter: because it’s immensely and enduringly hard to find good friends, both when we are in the role of readers and (slightly less obviously) when we are writers too. We need books because no one around us understands what it feels like to be us, can make sense of the confused emotions coursing through us, can be bothered to expend the requisite doses of sympathy and care or is liberated and imaginative enough not to pay attention to the narrow prejudices and pieties of our age.</p>
<p>We invented writing partly because – quite simply – there was no one in the vicinity who could understand what we needed to express or had the language for what we were feeling. These bound boxes of carefully chosen words immeasurably expanded the sorts of people we could have access to. No longer was the mountain range or the ocean an immovable obstacle. No longer did we have to draw our friends from the surrounding selection of cattle-rangers or landed gentry, schoolchildren or urban lawyers. We could consort freely with a waspish 17th-century French poet; we could become best friends with a proud Māori sailor. We can now, thanks to our awesomely filled libraries, spend a night in bed with someone who – at last – properly grasps what is involved in our relationship, a world expert at sensitivity and insight who died 230 years ago on another continent, a total stranger who understands us better than we understand ourselves. We can take a long train journey with a young Iranian woman who awakens our buried senses with evidence of her own heightened awareness. We can get through a diﬃculty at work with a samurai from 14th-century Japan, and we can survive our children’s tumultuous early years with a psychologist friend who – in a copiously underlined and watermarked paperback – repeatedly tells us what amounts to: ‘I know, keep going. This is all to be expected.’</p>
<p>Every literary endeavour is a testament both to loneliness and to a supreme effort to overcome it through an appeal to the mind of an imagined stranger. We become writers because when we tried to speak in company someone laughed, someone walked away, someone questioned our legitimacy or our right to feel. And we become readers because, though we know so many people, none seem able right now to address the aches and the emotional webs inside us; none seem ready to follow us into the details of our sadness or our longing. What a victory over the constant incomprehension and local obscurantism for those bits of bound paper to transcend time and space and allow us to settle beside and learn from a 3rd-century Roman general, a young, 18th-century, neurasthenic English doctor or a contemporary Nigerian novelist who intuits more about our love story than we do.</p>
<p>We can be grateful that books allow us to access not just friends but the best bits of them. In person, the author, like us, would often have been grumpy, vindictive or morose. They might have been short-tempered with us and even sometimes shallow. But all that has been edited away and carefully rearranged to leave only a pristine text that represents the finest moments of another’s spirit. The book we hold in our hands is a version of the author superior to the author themselves: a human minus all the usual hesitations and meanderings, honed into something brilliant, sharp and more perfect than any of us can ever be, a concentration of intelligence by which we can now orient ourselves and renew our hopes.</p>
<p>None of us needs, in theory at least, ever to be alone with anything again because somewhere in the 170 million or so books written since the dawn of time, some ‘friend’ or another will have written down what we most needed to hear and to understand. We can almost feel grateful for the monumental scale of the loneliness of our species – and the continuous, determined ingenuity of the writerly response to it.</p>
