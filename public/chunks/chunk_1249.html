        <h2>The Earth from the Air</h2>
<p>The show through the familiar ovaloid window is seldom ever quite the same. On some flights, it features immense horizons illuminated a burning pink by a sun setting somewhere at the edge of a continent. On others, we’re in pitch blackness interrupted only by a thousand stars and an occasional sibling aircraft streaking ruby-red beneath us. On certain journeys, we are granted vistas over the endless icy emptiness of northern Canada or Mongolia; on others, all we can see is a misty ocean traversed, every now and then, by an oil tanker or cargo ship the — size of a full stop.
Whatever the particularities, these views belong to a unitary category of place that is as universally ignored as it is important, consoling and redemptive: the earth from above. How seldom we pay it the slightest attention; our forebears would have been astonished and even frightened by our nonchalance. They wouldn’t have been able to stop staring. Leonardo da Vinci and Poussin would have relentlessly sketched the formations of cirrus and cirrostratus clouds; Galileo and Newton might never have recovered their footing. And yet, how quick we are to pull down the blind irritably so that we can more clearly follow the story on our screen of two people pretending to fall in love, while outside, a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent 1000s carry us over the forbidding 8,586metre peak of Mount Kanchenjunga.
Humans are notoriously hard to bear at proximity: the closer we are to them, the more they madden and disappoint. Misanthropy is an almost inevitable response to a walk through an average shopping mall. But from up here, our species appears endearing, even sweet. Look at how we build our nests; look at how our motorways wind carefully around our warehouses and how our houses line up in pristine grids along the edges of our settlements. We can peer at the ant colony with unusual tenderness. Down there, the cupboards may be dirty, the kids may be shouting and the garden in a mess but such infelicities are shielded from the eye above. Even a retail park or a bungalow begins to look elegant from a mile up. A benevolence descends; a god might love us if that’s as close as they got. It isn’t easy being us. We’re doing our best, going to work in our tiny cars beetling along our miniscule ring roads, trying to earn a living in our mini skyscrapers before our little lives draw to a close and we’re laid to rest in some toy-like cemeteries just visible somewhere by the window’s edge.
We can be reassured by how much remains not-us. There’s still a lot of empty sky, a lot of sea on which we don’t normally sail and a lot of desert in which we haven’t found a way to live. Our infernal chatter takes place within a welcome vastness and silence.
We spend far too long pressed dangerously close against our fears and regrets. We have wasted what might be years worrying about catastrophes that haven’t yet occurred. Up here, an adequate perspective can be restored. The mountains return to being the molehills they are always likely to have been. It doesn’t matter so much who said what to whom at the office, who mislaid the keys or who started the sulk. We’ll try not to pull that blind down again in such a hurry; we’ll strive to pay a bit more attention to the philosophy of sagehood on offer on the other side.</p>
