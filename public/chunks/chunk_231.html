            <h3>Accepting ourselves sexually</h3>
<p>Theoretically, we live in sexually liberated times. Officially, modern societies have become open-minded about what consenting adults get up to in private. However, this has not removed the likelihood of being beset by profound feelings of shame. As individuals, we tend to remain grievously constrained about what we can admit to liking or wanting in bed. It is hard not to consider our true sexual appetites with embarrassment, and to be either very restricted or outright mute with our partners about who we really are in sexual terms. Rather than sex being the exciting, playful adventure we might have imagined, it often ends up a minefield of disappointment, compromise and caution.</p>
<p>Ironically, the main obstacle to accepting and then explaining the more complicated parts of our sexual nature to other people is that we don’t have a reasonable or kindly view of it ourselves. We fear that others will find us weird or confusing because, secretly, that’s how we appear to ourselves.</p>
<p>The sense that we need to hide, deny and bury away key elements of who we are is not good for us. When we repress things that are important, they make themselves heard in other ways. As psychoanalysis has revealed, the ‘dirty’ parts of ourselves can show up disguised as greed, harsh opinions, bad temper, the longing to boss other people about, alcoholism or other forms of risky, damaging behaviour. There is a high price for disavowing powerful parts of ourselves.</p>
<p>The core skill for a more properly liberated sexuality is a richer, more enlightened vision of what sexual desire actually aims at. It is easy to become disgusted with ourselves because our desires seem so opposed to our more caring or intelligent sides. But properly understood, the most apparently ‘dirty’ or peculiar practices reveal a logic that is far more connected than we might have imagined to our standard self-image and sense of dignity.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to be aggressive and forceful in sex and maybe handcuff a lover or whip them hard, we have not taken leave of our senses. This can be an exciting prospect because it carries with it the promise that our aggression may not always be destructive. It can be allied to an underlying feeling of love, and therefore suggests that we can unite our powerful and our tender sides in a single act. The fantasy is that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint; no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate and very real problem of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person. In the sexual game, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety – because one might be mistaken about another’s wishes, because there might be resentment, because one might hurt someone – the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.</p>
<p>Or suppose we want to be humiliated and shouted at in a sexual scenario. We may be turned on by the idea of passivity and submission as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won’t have our best interests at heart. They won’t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission. But the deep hope in the erotic scenario is that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion.</p>
<p>The essence of sexual liberation should be mental.</p>
<p>It is a common feature of all sexual fantasies that they do not – of course – genuinely solve the problems from which they draw their excitement. But we shouldn’t worry if the fantasy fails to solve the problem in reality. What we’re looking for is simply a way of explaining and sympathising with a desire.</p>
<p>Our sexual imagination can seem frightening at times when it advances scenarios that would be problematic in reality. But we already know how to juggle fantasy in other areas of our lives. For instance, we might enjoy reading a novel in which the central character is interrogated by the secret police; it’s a thrilling episode in the book, although it would be traumatic to undergo such an ordeal in real life. The fact that we enjoy a chapter says little about our views on reality.</p>
<p>Sexual excitement is fairly easy to understand and not contrary to reason. It is continuous with many of the things we want in other areas. Although our erotic enthusiasms might sometimes sound odd or off-putting, they are motivated by a search for the good; a search for a life marked by understanding, sympathy, trust, unity, generosity and kindness. The things that turn us on are almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we’d like things to be. The essence of sexual liberation should be mental: in our own heads we can properly articulate the legitimacy and sanity of our interests and excitements. And if we can first explain something calmly and clearly to ourselves, we have a much greater chance of being able subsequently to explain it to a lover.</p>
<p>The experience of erotic liberation does not depend on being able to locate a special person who understands us; it’s to do with feeling that we can offer a proper explanation of ourselves to other people. They might or might not be interested in the things that interest us, but we’re freed from caring so much about their approval because we already have approval from a source that matters much more: ourselves.</p>
