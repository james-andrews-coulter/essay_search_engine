        <h3>¶ Sentimentality</h3>
<p>Sentimentality is a permanent temptation of our minds, resulting from squeamishness around excessively unpleasant evidence and ideas.</p>
<p>It is sentimentality that leads us to think that adults couldn’t really abuse the children who are in their care; that it would be impossible for humans to harm something as large as the earth; that capitalism couldn’t have major errors in its functioning; that expensive family holidays will go well; that birthdays are always going to be fun; and that young couples who look attractive and sweet can be assured of happiness, especially after a lavish wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>We’re sentimental not from a lack of intelligence, but from a lack of courage, because the truth is simply so hard to bear.</p>
<p>In response to sentimentality, it is tempting to force others to shed their illusions with a certain brutality, to become sharply cynical to counter the prevailing saccharine assumptions. This is rarely effective, however. By heightening the sense of threat, harshness simply invites a stronger reaction of defensive denial.</p>
<p>A major ambition of a good culture should be to make the truth bearable. It shouldn’t blame us when we naturally resist reality; it should induct us to it with special care. Culture should understand that we have to be let down gently and that we need a lot of encouragement to take the full facts of existence on board. In a good culture, the darker things are not denied or flaunted; they are artfully and consolingly handled.</p>
