        <h4>A sense of being at odds with mainstream society</h4>
<p>Whether at work, with friends or around family, we are often hemmed in by exhausting requirements to fit in and subscribe to dominant notions of what it means to be good and acceptable. These requirements leave behind, or censor, a lot of our internal reality; there ends up being a lot we must not say and even more that we should not even feel. What a relief then to note (perhaps via a wry twitch in another’s upper lip) that we are in the presence of someone who knows how to adopt a gently sceptical perspective on prevailing assumptions – someone with whom we would be able to break away and express doubts about revered ideas or people and cast a cathartically caustic gaze on the normal rules of life. Good sex promises to feel like something of a conspiracy against everyone else.</p>
