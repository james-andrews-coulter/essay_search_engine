        <h2>2. Fear of Ageing</h2>
<p>‘There’s nothing tragic about being 50. Not unless you’re trying to be 25’</p>
<p>– Sunset Boulevard, 1950</p>
<p>In 2013 a 42-year-old American actress sued a Web site for revealing her age. ‘If one is perceived to be “over the hill”, i.e. approaching 40, it is nearly impossible for an up-and-coming actress … to get work’, read her lawsuit, ‘as she is thought to have less of an “upside”.’</p>
<p>Two years earlier a Californian woman admitted that, to help her 8-year-old daughter – a beauty-pageant contestant – get rid of the ‘wrinkles’ that appeared on the girl’s face when she smiled, she injected her with Botox. Said her daughter, ‘I check every night for wrinkles; when I see some I want more injections. They used to hurt, but now I don’t cry that much.’ Ignominy rained down on her mother – it’s so comforting to find someone we can all agree to hate. But she’d only pushed a cultural trend to its extreme. When is it acceptable to start Botoxing yourself or your children? Just-past-teens is now apparently a perfectly unremarkable age to start worrying about looking older.</p>
<p>Said an 8-year-old beauty pageant contestant, not much older than these ones, ‘I check every night for wrinkles; when I see some I want more injections.’</p>
<p>The next few pages lay out how ageing is popularly represented. You’ll notice that, whenever the subject is raised, both popular culture and political discussion immediately gravitate to old age, as though ageing were solely the business of our last decade or so of life. This view is reflected in the representations of ageing that follow, even though they’re a travesty of what ageing as a lifelong process really entails. They haven’t been included to depress you, although, if you’ve passed the last few decades in another solar system, they may shock you. To experience the ageing process differently, we need to draw on an alternative model of getting older: one that recognizes that the process starts at birth, never stops and always has the potential to enrich our lives.</p>
<p>But we also have to learn to recognize and name the rampant gerontophobia – an irrational fear of old people and dread of ageing – that we’ve come to take for granted, in order to constantly challenge it.</p>
<p>Grey aliens</p>
<p>Those who denigrate old age have what seems to be the most powerful weapon of all at their disposal: demographics. By 2050, 20 per cent of the world’s population will be 65 or over; Britain alone expects 50 per cent more people of this age by 2030, and a doubling of those over 85.</p>
<p>The West is certainly living through an unprecedented change in the age structure of the population, one which has inverted the population pyramid: for the first time – the result of falling birth rates at least as much as increased longevity – there are more people over 65 than under 16. By 2034, it’s predicted that the ‘old-age support ratio’ (the number of people of working age to every person who’s retired) will have fallen to 2.8, from 3.6 in 1971.</p>
<p>But these figures aren’t just presented as a demographic fact; they’re also used to fan fear. The language is apocalyptic: an ‘agequake’, a ‘demographic timebomb’ or even a ‘grey tsunami’ (take your pick of the catastrophe metaphors). We’re no longer at risk of an invasion of triffids or Martians but of old people – invariably portrayed as a major social problem and a drain on resources, rather than as a resource themselves.</p>
<p>But, as the independent think tank Demos has pointed out, the whole debate about increasing longevity makes dubious alarmist assumptions about who’s financially dependent on whom. In reality, increasing numbers of us of ‘working age’ today are unemployed, while growing numbers continue to work beyond state-pension age, so you can no longer neatly correlate age with economic activity.</p>
<p>And when it comes to care and support, ageist assumptions are even less accurate. Older people provide as much care as they receive: those aged 75 or over spend more time looking after someone, usually a partner, than young people – not to mention the informal but essential childcare being provided by so many grandparents. Is this being ‘economically inactive’?</p>
<p>Of course an ageing population throws up genuine dilemmas, particularly for women, who most often end up responsible for looking after older family members. It also undoubtedly creates extra costs and new needs, although the economist Phil Mullan, in his book The Imaginary Time Bomb, systematically dismantles the argument that ageing represents an unsupportable burden for industrialized societies. The debate about the financial costs of old people, he suggests, has been deliberately exaggerated, partly to shift responsibility for their financial support away from the state and onto private providers and older individuals themselves.</p>
<p>The ‘burden’ model of ageing isn’t new: Anthony Trollope satirized it in 1881 in his dystopian novel The Fixed Period. In the ex-British colony of Britannula in 1980, the President and Chamber have come up with a novel solution to the problem of a world burdened with ‘those who remain to live a useless and painful life’ – i.e. the aged. The day its citizens reach 67 (interestingly, Trollope’s own age when the book was published) the ‘fixed period’ of life requires them to submit to euthanasia. But when the first (and, unfortunately, vigorous) candidate nears the appointed hour, his urge to stay alive and his family and neighbours’ revulsion towards the policy create a major social crisis, one only ended by the intervention of the English.</p>
<p>What makes the burden model all the more bizarre is that it’s mostly put about by those very people who themselves are going to constitute this large cohort of the elderly. These commentators – the majority young adults or middle-aged – are peddling the frightening prospect of an invasion of old people draining public finances, seemingly oblivious of the fact that they’re describing themselves!</p>
<p>But ‘them’ never becomes ‘us’: it’s as if they’ve dealt with their own fears of ageing by displacing them onto the population at large. Or by assuming that the current cohort of old people will somehow obligingly stay on and continue to occupy the role in perpetuity, so that those who are now 30 to 50 will never have to take their place: today’s oldies will remain tomorrow’s oldies. And thus they condemn themselves to a kind of prolonged infantilism. What they don’t realize is that they’re banking disgust that they’ll have to draw on themselves – ourselves.</p>
<p>Indeed gerontologists, who study the process of growing old, have puzzled over this unique feature of ageism: that it’s prejudice against one’s future self. In this it differs from other kinds of prejudice and discrimination like sexism and racism. It’s fuelled, as we’ll see, by a refusal to admit that we too will age – by a profound dis-identification with old people. Or indeed that we are all, all the time, already ageing.</p>
<p>The helpless old</p>
<p>To detoxify ageing, to make it possible for us to think of ourselves as ageing, we need to throw off the caricatures of old people. Older people, for example, are almost invariably described as lonely, and there are some brilliant fictional portrayals of lonely old people. Clare Temple in Norah Hoult’s remarkable 1944 novel, There Were No Windows, is a woman aware of her creeping dementia: ‘When one hasn’t any more friends, then one makes friends with one’s chairs and tables. I say, “Well, at least you’ve stayed with me all these years.”’ And then there’s Elizabeth Taylor’s marvellously astute novel Mrs Palfry at the Claremont (1971): ‘She knew that, as she got older, she looked at her watch more often, and that it was always earlier than she had thought it would be. When she was young, it had always been later.’</p>
<p>It’s good that fiction explores this important aspect of human experience. And who can complain about campaigns launched by well-meaning charities to alleviate loneliness among ‘the elderly’ at Christmas? Yet when older people in all their diversity are so absent from popular culture, such campaigns inadvertently encourage us to see them almost exclusively through the prism of vulnerability. Nearly 1 in 5 old people may be lonely, but more than 4 in 5 presumably aren’t. Of course we shouldn’t wave away concerns about loneliness in old age on this account, but focusing on it so relentlessly makes it come to be seen as an inevitable, essential attribute of old age, understandably scaring those who are younger.</p>
<p>Who can complain about campaigns launched by well-meaning charities to alleviate loneliness among ‘the elderly’ at Christmas? Yet such campaigns inadvertently encourage us to see them almost exclusively through the prism of vulnerability.</p>
<p>If it is true that not all old people who live alone are lonely, it’s also true that many young people are. Indeed in an era where young people are assumed to be permanently texting and clubbing, perhaps there’s more stigma attached to being lonely and young than old. But you’re not going to be seeing a campaign about this any time soon …</p>
<p>Frailty is another persistent image of old age. In December 2012 a 90-year-old woman had to be evacuated from her flooded home in Somerset. Most of the newspaper and television reports framed this in an ‘old vulnerable victim’ way. In fact she’d retreated to the first floor of her farmhouse, determined to sit out the floods, until a power cut meant that she had no heat and couldn’t make herself a cup of tea. This wasn’t victimhood but resilience, self-reliance and stoicism.</p>
<p>Yet popular culture can’t seem to find a language to represent this aspect of age. Shakespeare’s King Lear, raging against the waning of his powers, has metamorphosed, in modern society, into Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), the faded movie star in Billy Wilder’s film Sunset Boulevard, raging against Hollywood and the talkies: all is loss, shrinkage.</p>

<p>Contemptible bodies</p>
<p>Artists, too, find it hard to portray the aged body realistically and at the same time lovingly and respectfully. Many Renaissance and baroque artists depicted old age as a time of ‘hideous ruin’, but there was no sadism or contempt in Rembrandt’s portraits of age, only dignity, a deep empathy still moving centuries later. Albrecht Dürer’s 1514 charcoal sketch of his 63-year-old mother showed her face gaunt and wrinkled, that of a woman who’d given birth eighteen times, and yet with a kind of grandeur about her.</p>
<p>Lucian Freud painted his own ageing body beautifully – it remained strong and muscular under his gaze. But look at his unflinching portraits of the faces of older friends, family and models: unsentimental, yes, but also dispassionate – an almost clinical examination of decay.</p>
<p>In the hands of lesser artists this becomes what sociologist Mike Featherstone has called ‘a pornography of old age’, a luxuriating in disgust. You find the same quality in some writers, especially female, who’ve dealt with their own discomfort about ageing by turning their humorous eye onto their own bodily changes. The doyenne of this deprecated female body was Nora Ephron, in I Feel Bad About My Neck:</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer’s sketch of his 63-year-old mother showed her face gaunt and wrinkled, yet with a kind of grandeur about her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh the necks. There are chicken necks. There are turkey-gobbler necks. There are elephant necks. There are necks with wattles and necks with creases that are on the verge of becoming wattles. There are scrawny necks and fat necks, loose necks, crêpey necks, banded necks, wrinkled necks, stringy necks, flabby necks, mottled necks … You have to cut open a redwood tree to see how old it is, but you wouldn’t have to if it had a neck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this gallery of the grotesque, the reader has only different varieties of animal with which to identify. Or a tree.</p>
<p>Age is all</p>
<p>One problem with growing old in our culture is that everything comes to be seen through the prism of age. American psychologist Elissa Melamed, in her wonderful book Mirror, Mirror: The Terror of Not Being Young, published thirty years ago, tells the story of a 70-year-old woman who visited her doctor to complain about her painful right knee: ‘You’re 70 years old, what do you expect?’ he asked. ‘But my left knee is 70 too,’ she retorted, ‘and it’s fine.’ Older people are rarely referred for psychotherapy (and not just because of Freud’s view, rebuffed down the years, that their mental processes aren’t elastic enough to make them suitable), because depression is seen as just another inevitable aspect of old age.</p>
<p>The icons of old age are all about infirmity – bath chairs, stairlifts and Zimmer frames. The road sign for elderly people is a hunched woman and a man clutching a cane (an image that Age UK five years ago complained was outdated). Now we may want to destigmatize dependency, as I suggest in Chapter 7, but first we need to topple it from its prime position as emblem of age, along with slippers, dentures and hearing aids. Not because there’s anything wrong with these things (on the contrary, let’s hear it for dentures and hearing aids!), but because they’re used to generalize old people, and identify them not with abilities but disabilities.</p>
<p>Cinema is particularly at fault. If you’re old in movies you’re almost certainly miserly, deaf or depressed (this latter hardly surprising, given the poverty of the lines you have to utter). Or a witch, crone or curmudgeon. You can either be demonized or patronized – take your pick.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most pernicious stereotype of old age – and the competition is keen – is that it’s a ‘second childhood’. In the words of anthropologists Jenny Hockey and Allison James, ‘elderly people have been transformed into metaphoric children.’</p>
<p>Jaques’s ‘seven ages’ speech in Shakespeare’s As You Like It is partly to blame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last scene of all,</p>
<p>That ends this strange eventful history,</p>
<p>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</p>
<p>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to detoxify ageing for ourselves, let’s start here. The idea that senescence is the mirror image of childhood, with each of the capacities then acquired now relinquished – a kind of ‘last in, first out’ – is a particularly nasty example of the narrative of decline, obliterating a person’s entire life experience in the process.</p>
<p>There’s one kind of person, though, who, no matter their age, escapes this fate. They’ll never be consigned to the catchall category of ‘pensioner’, but, alas, you can’t elect to join them: they’re the older celebrity. Fame seems to trump age as a defining label. Whether you’re the Queen or Paul McCartney, David Hockney or Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton or Maya Angelou, your celebrity will almost certainly expose you to critical media scrutiny, especially if you’re a woman, but in return you won’t be seen as old or be referred to as an old person: this is what cultural power buys you.</p>
<p>Denying Age</p>
<p>Since we last met them, Gina’s parents have been busy. Her mother, Sara, rushes from her dermal-filler injections to her personal trainer. Gina’s father, Clive, meanwhile, has set up a company organizing ‘grey gap years’, and has started to take the human-growth hormone, prescribed by an American doctor friend of his, that promises to reverse the signs of ageing. Baby boomers both, at 56 and 62 respectively, they’re convinced that they and their peers have redefined ageing, and can think, supplement and exercise old age away. Or at least postpone it. Unflagging Sara and Clive are examples of the ‘third age’.</p>
<p>The term originated in France in the 1970s but was popularized in Britain by Peter Laslett in 1989, who placed it between the second age of adulthood and the fourth age of dependency and ill-health. Once the children had grown up and the most intensive demands of paid work were over, he argued, healthy, active and educated people needed to put their abilities to good use, and not consign themselves to a life of nothing but hobbies.</p>
<p>The fourth age</p>
<p>In many respects Laslett was prescient, helping develop the University of the Third Age, for instance. But there’s a terrible flaw here. The idea of ‘the third age’ – a period of adventure and personal growth for the healthy and moneyed – requires the existence of a later ‘fourth age’, into which can be corralled all those luckless older souls, or poor, unhealthy middle-aged ones, who aren’t in any position to swap the ski lift for the stairlift. In order for our fifties, sixties, seventies and early eighties to be reconceived as ‘not old’, those in their late eighties and early nineties (along with those who’ve aged ‘badly’) have to agree to be ‘only old’.</p>
<p>Indeed, when it came to the very old, Laslett’s book, A Fresh Map of Life, wasn’t quite so fresh. If the third age was the age of fulfilment, the fourth was nothing other than the age of decline – or ‘dependence and decrepitude’, as he so charmingly styled it – for the only role that Laslett saw for fourth-agers was a complete withdrawal from life. Perhaps he was a pioneer in this regard, too, for his attitude to the ‘old old’ is now widespread, and the fourth age has come to be seen as a kind of antechamber of death, its entrance boarded up by third-agers determined to escape its embrace.</p>
<p>Sara, as she swallows her glucosamine and does her daily Sudoku to keep her joints and mind supple, has signed up enthusiastically to the concept of ‘successful ageing’. She and her friends believe this is achieved through willpower and choice – for to become one of the ‘new aged’ the price you pay isn’t just the cost of gym membership: you need to be constantly vigilant, eternally self-monitoring. (And, if you’re a woman, remember especially not to ‘let yourself go’ – as if your self were entirely a property of your youth and could go AWOL.)</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to work out how dangerous this way of thinking is. We’ve created a new stereotype – that of the mobile, healthy and affluent ‘new old’, which at the same time demonizes the immobile, sick and poor ‘old old’. It’s as if old age these days only befalls those too powerless, poor or stupid to do something about it. Those who shamefully surrender to the ageing process surely deserve what they get – ‘unsuccessful ageing’, since third-agers like Sara and Clive have convinced themselves that, with enough discipline and self-control, the body can always be transcended. But it can’t.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why Michael Haneke’s award-winning film Amour so stunned audiences: it showed how the lives of a sophisticated, educated and affluent bourgeois couple could be suddenly devastated by a stroke – hers. Against this, no amount of glucosamine and Sudoku would have been remotely effective.</p>
<p>For the truth is that we all have to go into that good night eventually, gently or otherwise – to deny this is nothing more than magic thinking. Sure, moisturize all you want, exercise away – of course staying mobile is good and looking after yourself important. But those anti-ageing nostrums and elixirs that promise to freeze the ageing process? Why, they’re simply re-stigmatizing ageing all over again, even as they pretend to de-stigmatize it. And the magazine articles that tell you ‘How To Look Fabulous At Fifty’, or extol the arrival of the ‘yummy granny’? They encourage you to deal with the prejudice against old people not by challenging it but by trying not to look old.</p>
<p>They’re just gerontophobia in its latest incarnation. We’re (almost) all Dorian Grays now, demanding that the fourth-agers do our ageing for us: that they agree to be old so that the rest of us don’t have to.</p>
<p>Sara and Clive aren’t stupid. Deep in their fish-oil-supplemented marrow they know that, like some black people in the pre–civil rights period who tried to ‘pass’ as white, they’re trying to ‘pass’ as younger. But Clive reasons that he’s just facing up to the reality identified by Steve Martin in the film Bowfinger: ‘Employers can smell 50’.</p>
<p>Sara and Clive also know that none of these age-resisting strategies are available to Dolores, their 63-year-old Spanish cleaner, who brought up four children single-handed and looks old enough to be their grandmother; the nearest she gets to doing step aerobics is hoovering their stairs.</p>
<p>The profits of fear</p>
<p>Sara may be hooked on Estée Lauder’s ‘Advanced Night Repair’, but she doesn’t like the implication that ageing entails a breakage of some kind. Nor does she warm to those creams that call themselves ‘mature skin corrector’, as if ageing were nature’s mistake. She uses a lotion called ‘Time Delay’, though of course she knows that it can’t. Sara realizes that she’s never seen a product or service labelled ‘pro-age’, nor does she even understand what it would mean to be pro-age.</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising since the fears of ageing baby boomers have proved enormously lucrative – the anti-ageing market is predicted to reach over $290 billion (£180 billion) globally by 2015. The third age is now all about consumption – products, procedures and leisure activities. Anyone for anti-ageing chocolate? Or a ‘nutraceutical’ capsule ‘scientifically developed to make you look and feel younger’?</p>
<p>Even though Gina has only just reached 30, her own self-surveillance has already begun. Indeed skin creams target not only those wrinkles already visible but also those ‘programmed: waiting to appear in the future.’ Unwrinkled, in this formulation, doesn’t exist: the best you can be is pre-wrinkled. Supposedly rejuvenating lotions are modelled by 30-year-old women, even though we all know that they didn’t have any wrinkles for the lotion to erase in the first place.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason why young women of Gina’s age advertise these products: because this is who the advertiser’s target audience is – anxious 30-year-olds. A 2002 survey found that fear of ageing was no longer confined to 35- to 49-year-olds but had spread even to 20-year-olds.</p>
<p>The beauty industry, in particular, has discovered how many more products it can sell if it segments the market, with different versions targeted at women in their twenties, thirties, forties and fifties (presumably after this you’re on your own). Anxieties about ageing now set in so early that Carrie, who is 25, reports that almost all of her friends — but not her — have already had Botox. Maggie Kuhn, the leader of the Gray Panthers, said to me in 1978 that the surest sign of change would be when ‘you look your age’ became a compliment. That day seems further away than ever.</p>
<p>Them and Us</p>
<p>But what if Aubrey de Grey, author of Ending Aging, is right when he talks of rejuvenation breakthroughs that could reverse human ageing in our lifetime – would any of us pass up the opportunity? Is there really anything wrong with seeing yourself as an ageless ‘amortal’, or a ‘rejuvenile’, if it liberates you from the prison of ageing?</p>
<p>Well, yes, if such hubris also entails contempt for old people, and is another version of age shame. It also may come back to bite you if, in spite of your best efforts, your body starts to ‘betray’ your years. It’s all very well intoning ‘use it or lose it’, but this doesn’t allow for the possibility that you may still lose it despite using it.</p>
<p>In any case, ageing is not just a ‘state of mind’, despite the slogan – it’s one of the most important dimensions of life. ‘You are not only as old as you feel,’ the sociologist Molly Andrews argued in her brilliant essay ‘The seductiveness of agelessness’, ‘you are also as old as you are.’ The concept of agelessness, she suggests, erases our experience, strips us of our history and leaves us with nothing but mimicry of our youth.</p>
<p>Who can blame Sara and Clive if, in such a gerontophobic culture, they strive to distance themselves from old people now holed up safely in the category of ‘Them’? Since old age is so stigmatized, most of us do everything we can to dis-identify with it. Think of it: in our culture, ‘to feel your age’ is a synonym for feeling bad and lacking vitality. Just imagine if it connoted wisdom and experience.</p>
<p>Sara and Clive are part of the ‘exceptionalist’ tendency: other people, they concede, may age, but they won’t. This means, as sociologist Sarah Matthews has pointed out, that you have one definition for other ageing people, and one for yourself. How isolating! It prevents you from making common cause with other older people. So a 61-year-old woman, responding to a Mass Observation survey, observed that ‘If I go into a room and all around me I see grey heads I tend to assume that I’m in a gathering of the elderly – for one awful moment I stereotype a lot, forgetting, honestly, that I am among their number.’ This is prejudice not towards one’s future self, but towards one’s present.</p>
<p>The impact of ageism</p>
<p>The effects of the prejudices lined up here are even more powerful than we consciously realize. In their study comparing the memory of young and old Chinese and Americans, social psychologist Ellen Langer and epidemiologist Becca Levy found that the older Chinese, exposed to less ageism than their American counterparts, performed memory tests more like younger Chinese. Among the Americans, on the other hand, there were significant differences between the old and young. So the beliefs that we imbibe about our waning powers may turn out be self-fulfilling, because our culture teaches us how to be old.</p>
<p>In fact, Levy has gone so far as to claim that these stereotypes can actually affect our survival. Her 2002 study concluded that older people with a more positive perception of ageing lived seven and a half years longer than those with a more negative one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, by believing that ‘middle age’ is infinitely extendible, we cheat ourselves of the possibility of a good old age. A 1996 American survey asked 50-year-olds when old age began: the average age they plumped for was 79.5 years – this is when the average life expectancy of Americans was 76.1. So they really did hope they died before they got old.</p>
<p>The third way</p>
<p>This is a book about how to age and not about how not to, but we’ve started here because the first stage in age-acceptance is to identify and name those social currents that militate against it, that work to prevent us from wanting anything to do with the ageing process. By scrutinizing and then refusing the dominant myths about ageing we can begin to understand that our own ageing experience will be particular to us: you don’t have to trade in your personal subjectivity for a free bus pass. We’ll also start to appreciate that joie de vivre can intensify through age, and that you can be a more joyful person at 36 than at 26.</p>
<p>There’s another approach to ageing, but it requires a major gestalt switch: each time we see an older person, we need to imagine them as our future self, and, rather than recoil from their wrinkles or infirmities, applaud their resilience. We need to rehumanize older people, to attribute to them the same rich internal world, set of passions and network of complex human relationships that we assume exist in younger people and in ourselves.</p>
<p>Prejudice leads to abuse: those caring for old people, whether relatives or in residential care, are more likely to treat them carelessly or abusively after years of exposure to stereotypes that effectively dehumanize them. If we accepted that we, too, will one day become old, we’d be clamouring for generous pay for those who might have to help look after us.</p>
<p>The rewards of seeing ageing in this way are enormous. In another study, Levy and her colleagues filmed older people before and after watching a computer game that emitted subliminal positive or negative messages about old age and the ageing process. Those who’d received the positive messages walked faster, and with a greater spring in their step.</p>
<p>No one is pretending that shifting our thinking is easy, or can be done in isolation. But, happily, the constant vigilance that you need to resist the denigration and denial of ageing is no greater – and is probably less – than the vigilance you need to ensure that you don’t betray the slightest signs of ageing. At some point or other, age resistance becomes frankly futile – you’ll either die or start to look old – but the energy you use to accept the fact of ageing but refuse its stereotypes will serve you well for the rest of your life. If there ever was an insurance policy that could help enrich the process of getting older, it’s this refusal to pathologize age, this spirited age-acceptance – of living time rather than trying to stop it.</p>
<p>Older can be happier</p>
<p>Although it’s easy to find horror stories about old people’s lives and living conditions, for most of us the reality is different. In fact reams of research show that people become happier as they age, whether through developing new emotional strategies or simply through a change in priorities (less striving for outward achievements, more savouring of relationships). But we mis-predict that we’ll become less happy as we age.</p>
<p>The poet Sharon Olds put it beautifully in ‘The Older’, where she describes how lovable and ‘almost beautiful’ she finds her ageing body, which her younger self would have found repugnant.</p>
<p>Pete Townshend of The Who famously sang ‘Hope I die before I get old’. On his sixtieth birthday he declared that he was much happier than when he’d written those words.</p>
