<p>Wrinkles, sensible shoes and Alzheimer’s – these, or something like them, are what most of us would come up with if we were asked to free-associate on the subject of age. But they’re utterly misleading because they elide ageing with old age or sickness. In fact we’re all ageing from the moment we’re born: you could say that birth causes age – ageing certainly isn’t possible without it. As soon as you understand ageing as something that happens throughout the life cycle – taking place right now to us all, whatever our age – you begin to see it in a different perspective from the standard one in which we’re young and then, hey presto, once we reach a certain threshold (25, 30, 40, 50 – take your pick), we cross over into ‘ageing’.</p>
<p>That view, so culturally entrenched, is hard to shake off. It’s certainly the case that most young people long to grow older – they associate ageing with the freedom to do things hitherto forbidden them. When can I stay up till ten? When am I allowed to go to a music festival on my own? I can’t wait to turn 18 and buy alcohol legally. When you’re young, ageing means freeing yourself from the tyranny of parents, making choices for yourself and gaining more control over your own life. Ageing, when you’re a child, is viewed entirely as the medium through which your capabilities (to walk and talk, write and reason) develop and is toasted as the route to independence. It used to be your twenty-first but now it’s your eighteenth, a birthday that shouts ‘At last!’</p>
<p>But then, almost imperceptibly, this view of ageing begins to change: for most of us, probably in our twenties, anticipation and optimism come to be joined, sometimes replaced, by anxiety and even dread. The brief interlude of freedom without responsibilities ends, and the demands of adulthood, such as having to earn a living, hove into view. The prospect of life without six-week-long summer holidays is a truly shocking rite of passage. People now expect you to behave in ways that accord with their idea of an adult, with a seeming disregard for the fact that you may not feel like an adult, or even know what feeling like an adult might feel like. Growing older begins to seem more loss than gain, something to be resisted. By 25 one has the right to do pretty much everything one longed for earlier, and now the rest of life starts to roll out terrifyingly ahead. Alexa, 16, a London schoolgirl, told her aunt that she woke up in the middle of the night, worrying about how she’d know how to fill in a tax return when the time came.</p>
<p>Indeed many young people plump for 25 as the age that adulthood really begins. It isn’t an entirely arbitrary age, for only at 25 are our frontal lobes fully developed, and the need for instant gratification modified by cognitive maturity, a greater capacity for empathy and a longer-term perspective. Twenty-five, as 24-year-old Becky put it with just a hint of alarm, is a quarter of a century old. It’s when she plans to give up smoking, as if she’ll become suddenly more susceptible to mortality on the morning of her twenty-fifth birthday. Or perhaps on that day it will have become finally undeniable.</p>
<p>How completely our attitudes change, within the space of a decade or two: from looking down on those younger (in the family, at school), to looking down on those older …</p>
<p>Ageing today</p>
<p>Ageing in the twenty-first century is a particularly confusing business. Today, 34 often looks like 24 a mere fifty years ago, and 44 like 34. But just because you look this way doesn’t mean you are.</p>
<p>Traditionally, growing up meant leaving home: you had to separate from adults before you could become one. This, though, has become an increasingly extended process. We can salute the fact that some ideas about ageing have become less rigid, and that most of us feel less programmed to get a job, get married, buy a flat and have a child – all of these, in this order, at a prescribed age.</p>
<p>But tuition fees, high unemployment, the exorbitant cost of housing – all these mean that young people are financially reliant on their parents for far longer. ‘Youth’ used to be a short transitional phase between childhood and adulthood: today it can extend to your thirties. Parents are having to plough so much money into their kids that some expect a return for their investment. They also consider themselves entitled to a greater degree of involvement in their children’s decisions – after all, they’re paying for them – even though they may be ill-equipped to give advice about the new and unprecedented social realities that their kids are facing.</p>
<p>(In Ford cars there’s now a feature which allows parents to control in advance the speed at which their children drive, along with programming insistent seat belt reminders and low-fuel warnings. It’s like having your parent in the car along with you – a kind of Sat Nag. To the refrain ‘get out of my life’, adolescents will now be able to add ‘get out of my car’.)</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of those in their twenties and thirties now fear growing up. The man-child holds on tightly to his video games and comics, and refuses to change. He equates being grown up with joylessness. But perhaps it’s less about having a mortgage or a pension and more about learning to take responsibility for your spending; about being able to defer gratification instead of insisting ‘I want it now’; about not saying the first thing that comes into your head and thinking about other people as well as yourself? Perhaps growing up is another way of saying that your perspective widens and lengthens. We need to rethink our ideas about what ageing means at every age, and not just old age.</p>
<p>Reversing age?</p>
<p>And yet even the perpetual adolescent, offered the chance to relive his teenage years, would probably refuse. All right, mutter those who decry the ageing process: perhaps there are some pleasures brought about by ageing, maybe being 15 wasn’t the utopia we nostalgically reimagine it to be. But wouldn’t it be wonderful to go back to that earlier age with the knowledge accrued from this later one? To be younger but wiser – can there be a more common fantasy? Or a more preposterous one? It’s like wanting your child to be born with the ability to walk, or able to recite Homer’s Odyssey in Greek at the age of 3 – a petulant, infantile, if altogether understandable, desire to obliterate time.</p>
<p>All sorts of films have reimagined the life cycle and rearranged the ages: from Big (1988), in which Tom Hanks plays a 12-year-old boy transposed into the body of a 30-year-old man; to 18 Again! (1988), where an 81-year-old man played by George Burns swaps bodies with his 18-year-old grandson; to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), based on the Scott Fitzgerald short story, in which Brad Pitt’s character is born with the appearance and maladies of an old man and ages in reverse.</p>
