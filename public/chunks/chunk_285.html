        <h2>3.  Idleness</h2>
<p>Why do many of us find it so difficult to take time off from obligations, or uninterrupted activity – to allow ourselves, occasionally, to do nothing?</p>
<p>In 1952, an American psychiatrist, Alexander Reid Martin, wrote an article titled ‘The Fear of Relaxation and Leisure’. In it, he describes patients who could not tolerate the idea of time free from work. Some of them could not go on holiday without a doctor’s prescription; others had heart attacks or committed suicide when they forced themselves, or were forced, to take a vacation.</p>
<p>Not many people have such extreme reactions to going on holiday anymore; instead, to some extent we have banished real leisure altogether. Our restlessness, and the appurtenances of digital activity, can be taken anywhere; and many of us bring them with us on our vacations. It seems that while we are no longer driven by the work ethic, as Dr Martin’s patients were, an addiction to activity – and an accompanying fear of restfulness – is still with us. We may hold to the subliminal belief that occupation – of whatever kind – is virtuous, and laziness a vice. Or we may be afraid of falling into a Kierkegaardian state of emptiness, or what in early Christianity was called sloth – a vice leading straight to the ultimate sin of despair.</p>
<p>The word ‘leisure’ comes from Latin licere, to be permitted – and perhaps the first step in learning how to take time off is to give ourselves permission to do so. We might think of those early philosophers who devoted their lives to the cultivation of the self, and to conversation about the essential matters of existence, through which they thought they could also improve the lives of others. Or we might remember the thinkers of many periods who saw leisure as the very foundation of culture: of contemplation, the spiritual life and even the liberal arts. (The Greek word for school – schole – was derived from the word for leisure.) No less a personage than Bertrand Russell, in an essay called ‘In Praise of Idleness’, averred ‘that … there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached’. Russell, like his friend John Maynard Keynes, thought the solution was to adopt a four-hour working day, which would leave everyone free to pursue philosophy, cultural diversions and adult learning.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that the majority of humankind would find that much free time a boon, or that these oddly unrealistic proposals would be economically tenable for any society. Probably none of the older models of leisure are suited to our situation; for one thing, we are no longer divided between leisured and labouring classes, with free time being the prerogative of aristocratic elites. The great majority of us need to work, although perhaps not as relentlessly as many of us choose to; and we need to find ways of being leisurely that fit into our lives and enrich them. Still, the value attached to leisure in various traditions should reassure us. It is also worth remembering that leisure is not the same as laziness; and that it is necessary not only to the life of the mind, but to our physical and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>If we have given ourselves the assent to take time off, then perhaps we can first of all learn to enjoy moments or hours of unscripted idleness – intervals in which we can slough off the tensions accumulated during the day or week, and return to more pleasurable states of self and mind. Our cultures provide structured ways of calming down, such as yoga or the very popular Mindfulness movement, which specializes in condensed, short-term meditation. Indeed, the very brevity of Mindfulness sessions acknowledges the busy conditions of our lives; and its programme teaches its followers techniques for clearing their minds and reviving their energies through a foreshortened and compressed meditational process. Recently, some big organizations (such as Google) have caught on to the usefulness of such breaks – just as some of them have built in short naps for their employees – in making people work more efficiently afterwards. Many Mindfulness adherents have testified to the beneficial effects of such techniques, and there is no reason to doubt them. Others, however, find it too regimented and didactic; and I must admit that the idea of napping or meditating on cue in order to work better in the afternoon fills me with slight dread. It also seems to me a contradictory method of becoming peacefully self-aware.</p>
<p>My preference is for forms of relaxation which are less programmatic and more improvised; which proceed from individual personality rather than generalized precepts; and which restore us to a sense of positive pleasure in the texture of our daily lives, rather than just clearing our minds of problematic thoughts. It would be rather ironic for me to give instructions on how to do this; but perhaps some examples can be suggestive. I have a friend who sets aside a day a week to do nothing that she doesn’t feel like doing, and to follow her impulses if she does feel like doing something. She often sits in her favourite spot along an urban river, or in a cafe; sometimes she finds herself writing in her diary. A composer I know told me that he spends a part of each morning sitting at his kitchen table with a cup of coffee and letting thoughts and sensations arise as they will, without imposing particular order or meaning on them. He is a productive artist who understands the need for disciplined work; but he says that his seemingly lazy mornings are important to his process of composition.</p>
<p>Not all of us are going to write musical works as a result of a slow morning; but we all occasionally need to be able simply to savour the moment, to follow our errant musings and impulses, and sense the rhythms and inclinations of our thoughts and bodies. One consequence of spending so much time in the virtual world is that we become disconnected from our own physical presence and the physicality of our environment. Aside from depriving us of a fundamental sense of pleasure, this can affect our well-being. After all, the body is the very basis of the self; if it becomes too abstracted or dissociated from us, we may lose track of its needs, or the relish of its appetites. We may not know, for example, how much, or how little, we actually want to eat.</p>
<p>Savouring a long cup of coffee; relishing a new recipe that appeals to us; taking a slow saunter in a park or down an urban street without forcing the pace of our walk; these are ways of reconnecting with the sensuality of our bodies when we are not straining them through exercise or restraining them by sitting at the desk. They are ways of savouring the small pleasures of daily life, and of recovering the basic enjoyment of moving through the physical world.</p>
<p>Walking is of course a pastime with a long tradition, and writers from Coleridge to William Hazlitt have testified to the connection between the rhythms of this basic activity and creative thought. Coleridge especially took heroic walks, roaming for tens of miles over hill and dale, often in adverse weather conditions. On our idle days, we might not want to do anything so strenuous, and might want instead to amble in our own neighbourhood. If we live near a park, or in a rural setting, we can get the benefits of natural surroundings. Natural beauty, if we can relax into it, is a source of never-ending variety and aesthetic pleasure. Moreover, studies have shown that it has undoubted positive effects on our health. For example, hospital patients whose rooms look out onto a garden or some trees recover faster than those who have to stare all day at monotonous concrete.</p>
<p>But urban walking also has its rich sensations. Exploring one’s own neighbourhood can be as satisfying as travelling to exotic places, in a different way. When we walk down a familiar street which perhaps leads to something surprising, we can notice not only the large panorama, but the specific details. A new shop or an interesting bit of architectural design we’ve never spotted can also enliven our interest in our surroundings, and aesthetic appreciation. We are attached to our environment through our connection to small things as well as abstractions or big vistas – through what anthropologists, and latterly airport advertisements, call local knowledge.</p>
<p>Here’s Virginia Woolf on taking an evening walk in London, in an essay called ‘Street Haunting’:</p>
<p>Passing, glimpsing, everything seems accidentally but miraculously sprinkled with beauty, as if the tide of trade which deposits its burden so punctually and prosaically upon the shores of Oxford Street had this night cast up nothing but treasure. With no thought of buying, the eye is sportive and generous; it creates; it adorns; it enhances.</p>
<p>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte – an image of civilized (and civilizing) leisure.</p>
<p>Observing what is around us and registering errant impressions is a state not so much of passive inaction as of alert receptivity. Allowing ourselves to notice, to be open to our surroundings, is a way of awakening our curiosity in the world outside ourselves. The philosophical school of phenomenology was based on the idea that knowledge is derived from sensory perception. Such perception is a primary state of consciousness; but even so, it is highly complex. In order to perceive anything – to see the room we are in as a room, for example – the brain has to coordinate several neuronal strands: visual, auditory, spatial. How that is done – how such coordination adds up to instant and seamless perception – is still one of the central mysteries of conscious awarenesss.</p>
<p>But we do know that the brain changes throughout our lives, and is modified by external experience. It is through registering impressions of our surroundings that we add to the storehouse of our internal experience – the imagery we carry within ourselves, but also our memories.</p>
<p>We are, first of all, sentient creatures. Our primary perceptions and impressions are part of what we are; but in order to be open to such impressions, we need sometimes to slow down, and turn our attention outwards – to look. When we are rushing to the tube, we don’t really see the people we are passing, or, say, a new flower stand. Of course, sometimes (or rather, often) we need to rush to the tube. But we also need times of unstrained idleness in which we can meander spontaneously, and be alert and curious about our surroundings. This is a way of enriching our repertory of memories and textures of perception, and of reminding ourselves that there is pleasure in being sentient and alive.</p>
