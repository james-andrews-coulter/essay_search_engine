        <h3>4. Better questions</h3>
<p>One of the most common but also unusually diﬃcult questions we are liable to face in any long-term friendship, especially at the start of every new encounter, is: ‘What have you been up to recently?’</p>
<p>We meet up with a friend we haven’t seen in a while and – fair enough – they want to know what has been happening to us since we last saw them, and we, similarly, want to know the same about them. The mystery of individual existence is at play; two people are on a quest to break through the barriers of isolation and commune around a rich understanding of one another’s recent travails, fears and joys.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem. If our lives are in any way typical, we won’t – of course – have been up to anything that feels remotely noteworthy. We haven’t gone anywhere special; no one has died; we haven’t been sent on any remote or challenging missions; there hasn’t been any particular intrigue or significant professional development. With a degree of weariness and shame, we may once more simply have to brush away the question with an ‘Oh, not so much really’.</p>
<p>The more poignant reality, however, is that quite a lot has been happening. It always does. But it has been doing so at a subatomic level, at the level of emotional and perceptual change, which the enquiry, like a butterfly net with the wrong mesh size, is not well suited to catch. We may not have been involved in any outward dramas, but we have – deep in ourselves – felt a stream of sensations and ideas, as evanescent and fragile as they are significant and suggestive. Really quite a lot has been going on; it’s just that the question we are responding to doesn’t help us to make sense of any of it.</p>
<p>We deserve – and here societal conventions are predominantly to blame – to be on the receiving end of better sorts of question. In order to catch the marrow of life and to more accurately track the movements of another’s soul, we should normalise the raising and answering of new questions that skilfully pick up on the precise, detailed, intimate, sensory and, in the best ways, odd-sounding aspects of existence. We might, in a better-arranged world, learn to make use of some of the following:</p>
<p>• Have you rubbed your fingertips along any interesting materials recently?</p>
<p>• What images have been in your mind as you’ve been falling asleep?</p>
<p>• Are there particular bits of your past you’ve been feeling close to lately?</p>
<p>• What regrets have emerged?</p>
<p>• Who do you want to apologise to?</p>
<p>• What interesting or moving things have you spotted on your commute to and from work?</p>
<p>• What adjectives might capture the mood of this stretch of your life?</p>
<p>• What would the 5-year-old you think about who you are at the moment?</p>
<p>• In an ideal love affair that you’d like to have now, what might happen? Where would you want to be? What would you be doing for one another? What would they understand about you?</p>
<p>• What items from your wardrobe are you wearing most at this time?</p>
<p>• What is sad right now?</p>
<p>• What positions have you been sleeping in?</p>
<p>• What smells define this period of time? And what colours?</p>
<p>• What do you want to find out more about? What would you want explained to you? What sort of book would be really appropriate to read right now?</p>
<p>• What emotional puzzles are you – in the background – wrestling with?</p>
<p>• Where do you feel misunderstood?</p>
<p>• What are you impatient for?</p>
<p>• If this period of time was a shape, it might be a …? And a sound …? And a taste …? And a sort of jam or condiment …?</p>
<p>What we end up seeing in the world and in ourselves depends on the implicit questions we carry in us – which in turn reflect the sort of questions we have most often been asked by others. The more acute the questions we are asked, the more we will take note of.</p>
<p>One of the ways to think of certain works of art is as distinctive answers to fine-grained enquiries about what has been going on in someone’s life. If we had, for example, met the mid-century Italian painter Giorgio Morandi at a dinner party and asked him what he’d been up to recently, he might have struggled to come up with the sort of anecdotal material expected in a reply. But in the medium of his art, we find an exquisitely detailed record of what was truly going on for him and might, in a general way, be going on for us too. His paintings – many of which were painted in World War II during fierce Allied bombing in his native Bologna – contain no accounts of anything that could count as newsworthy. But they nevertheless deftly sensitise us to the movements of another’s soul. We see a succession of well-arranged vases, glasses and bottles, bathed in a variety of diffuse morning and evening lights. Morandi seems to be telling us: ‘And this is life too. This is what we see when we rightly understand what an occurrence is.’ His art symbolises a protest against an overly materially based interpretation of eventfulness. A truly significant happening might simply be that at 5.30 p.m., a shaft of light struck the stem of a vase and created an impression of harmony and repose. Or that at dawn, a bowl on the sideboard acquired a creamy texture that evoked the mystery of early childhood. This is reality as well, Morandi is hinting, once we learn to catch it with the right instrument.</p>

<p>Though we may not be turning out any paintings, we are all – in our minds, in a latent way – as observant, emotionally rich and easily impacted as any artist. The reason for our normal social muteness is that, through no fault of our own, we haven’t been given the opportunity to divulge what is at play within us. By expecting to sum up our lives as a series of events, we miss what they are in fact made up of – a discreet tapestry of sense impressions, longings, griefs, daydreams and easily erased intimations of beauty and pain.</p>
<p>So much has been happening to us of late. We’re just waiting for attentive friends to help us catch some of it with the right questions.</p>
