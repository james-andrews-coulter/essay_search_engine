        <h2>IIIStandardisation</h2>
<p>The sorrows of work are not limited to the likelihood that we will be somewhat unwillingly tied to a single field throughout our careers; even worse, our chosen field may turn out to be boring. We are liable to think that this fall into a tedious role must be our fault; a sign of our exceptional ineptitude. However, looked at dispassionately, boring jobs are an inherent and often unavoidable part of the modern economy.</p>
<p>When we speak of the opposite sort of job – an interesting job – we tend to refer to work that allows for a high degree of autonomy, personal initiative and (without anything artistic being meant by the word) creativity. In an interesting job, we won’t simply be following orders; we will have latitude about what path we select to meet an objective or what we think the right solution to a problem might be. A good job, defined like this, is one that allows for a good measure of personalisation: we have an opportunity to directly imprint who we are in the work we produce. We end up seeing the best parts of our personalities in the objects or services we generate.</p>
<p>A lot of the writing about the nature of work produced in Europe and the United States in the 19th century can be read as an attempt to understand how personalisation disappeared from the labour market, even as wages rose. The English art critic and social reformer John Ruskin (1819–1900) proposed that the medieval building industry had been marked by a high degree of personalisation, evident in the way that craftsmen carved gargoyles (grotesque animal or human faces) in distinctive shapes high up on cathedral roofs. The stonemasons might have had to work to a fixed overall design, and their toil was not always easy, but the gargoyles symbolised a fundamental freedom to place their own stamp on their work. Ruskin added more ruefully that the new housing developments of the industrial age were allowing no such freedom or individualism to flourish in the workforce.</p>
<p>Ruskin’s most devoted disciple, the poet and designer William Morris (1834–1896), extended the range of this idea of personalisation to a discussion of the making of furniture – his own area of expertise. Morris argued that the traditional way of making chairs and tables allowed artisans to see parts of themselves reflected in the character of the things they made. Every chair made by hand was as distinctive as its creator. In the pre-industrial age, thousands of people had been actively engaged in designing chairs, and every worker had been able to develop their own nuanced ideas about what a nice chair should be like.</p>

<p>However, an inevitable part of capitalism is a process of concentration and standardisation. There is a tendency for money, expertise, marketing clout and sophisticated distribution systems to be pooled together by a few big players, who outcompete and crush rivals and so achieve a daunting position in the marketplace. Barriers to entry rise exponentially. A well-financed operation can cut costs, assiduously research the preferences of consumers, marshal the best technology, and provide goods that can be of huge appeal to consumers at the best possible price. As a result, the artisanal mode of production cannot possibly compete – as Morris himself discovered when the traditional workshop that he established to make chairs for the Victorian middle classes was forced into receivership in the wake of a price war.</p>
<p>Today, there are, of course, still a few furniture designers around – some of them very well known – but this cannot disguise that what we call ‘design’ is quite a niche field employing a minuscule number of actors. The majority of those involved in the making and selling of furniture will have no opportunity to put their own character into the objects they are dealing with. They belong instead to a highly efficient army of labour that aims for rigorously anonymous execution.</p>
<p>Without intending to be mean-spirited or inherently hostile to the pleasures of work, capitalism has radically reduced the number of jobs that retain any component of personalisation.</p>
<p>For example, the Eames Aluminum Group chair was designed by American husband-and-wife team Charles (1907–1978) and Ray Eames (1912–1988) in 1958. It is a highly distinctive creation that reflects the ideals and outlook of the couple who designed it. If they had been artisans, operating their own small workshop, they might have sold a few dozen such chairs to their local customers in their lifetime. Instead, because they worked under capitalism for Herman Miller – a huge commercial office and home furniture manufacturing corporation – many hundreds of thousands of units have been, and continue to be, sold. A side effect of this triumph has been that the demand for well-designed, interesting chairs has been substantially cornered. Anyone wanting to make an office chair nowadays has to face the fact that it is already possible to buy a nice example, designed by two geniuses and available for rapid delivery by a global company at a competitive price from a highly efficient network of local branches.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the idea that the wealth of the world is being ever more tightly concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of people – the infamous ‘1%’. But capitalism doesn’t only concentrate money. There’s a more poignant, less familiar fact that only a small number of people – a sometimes overlapping, but often different 1% – have interesting, as in ‘personalised’, work.</p>
<p>It is telling that we are, at the same time, obsessed with the romance of individual genius. Our society has developed a near-fetishistic interest in the exploits of brilliant startups, colourful fashion gurus, and idiosyncratic film-makers and artists – characters who flamboyantly mould parts of the world in their own image and put their individual stamp on the things they do and make. We might like to think that we turn to them for inspiration, but it may be more the case that we use them to compensate ourselves for a painful gap in our own lives. The stories of successful personalisation have come to the fore just when the practical opportunities for personalised work have diminished. In a similar way, it was in the 19th century, during mass migration to cities, that novels about rural life achieved unprecedented popularity among newly urban audiences. We may, through our addiction to stories of lone creative geniuses, be trying to draw sustenance from qualities that are in woefully short supply in our own day-to-day working lives.</p>
<p>The prevalence of stories of individual creativity feed the illusion that personalised work is more normal than it really is. The many interviews and profiles mask the fact that, for almost all of us, it will prove nearly impossible to compete against the great forces of standardisation. For this reason, far more than because of anything we have done ourselves, many of us are likely to find a considerable portion of our work awkwardly tedious and dispiritingly free of any opportunities to carve our own gargoyles.</p>
