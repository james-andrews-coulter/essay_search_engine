        <h4>An unshockable nature</h4>
<p>The more we are honest with and exploratory about ourselves, the more we realise that there is much inside our characters that might surprise or horrify outsiders; that we possess alarming degrees of vulnerability, meanness, strangeness, waywardness and folly. Our standard response may be shame and embarrassment, yet we quietly hunger to be properly witnessed and accepted as we really are. What may prove supremely sexy, therefore, are suggestions that another person has explored their own deeper selves with courage, has a handle on their darkness and may, on this basis, be capable of extending an uncensorious perspective on our own.</p>
