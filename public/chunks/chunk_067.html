        <h2>Sunday Evening &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>It descends, normally, between around 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. and can be at its height at 6, especially when the weather is turning and the last of the daylight has burnished the sky a shade of crimson pink.</p>
<p>The Sunday evening melancholic feeling is ordinarily associated with work, and the prospect of going back to the office after a pleasant break. In truth, this doesn’t quite cover the complexity of what is going on. It isn’t just that we have some sort of work to do tomorrow that is dragging down our mood, but that we are going back to the wrong sort of work – even while we are in dire ignorance of what the right sort of work might actually be.</p>
<p>We all have inside us what we might term a true working self, a set of inclinations and capacities that long to exert themselves on the raw material of reality. We want to turn the vital bits of who we are into jobs and ensure that we can see ourselves reflected in the services and products we are involved in turning out. This is what we understand by the right job, and the need for one is as fundamental and as strong in us as the need to love. We can be as broken by a failure to find our professional destiny as we are by our inability to identify an intimate companion.</p>
<p>Feeling that we are in the wrong job, and that our true vocation lies undiscovered, is not a minor species of discomfort; it may be the central crisis of our lives.</p>
<p>We normally manage to keep this crisis at bay during the week. We are too busy and too driven by an immediate need for money. But it can come to trouble us on Sunday evenings. Like a ghost suspended between two worlds, the crisis has not been allowed either to live or to die, and so bangs at the door of consciousness, requiring resolution. We are sad because a part of us recognises that time is running out and that we are not presently doing what we should with what remains of our lives. The anguish of Sunday evening is our conscience trying to stir us inarticulately into making more of ourselves before time runs out.</p>
<p>Sunday evenings have a history. Until recently, the last hundred years or so, there was – for most of us – no question of our true selves ever finding expression in our work. We worked to survive and would be grateful for a minimal income. Such reduced expectations no longer hold. We know – because there are enough visible examples of people who have done so – that we could harness our sincere talents to the engines of commerce. We know that we don’t have to be unhappy in this area, which adds a feeling of particular shame if we still are.</p>
<p>We should not be so hard on ourselves. We don’t yet have the mechanisms in place to match all jobs to meaningful destinies. We can be both sure that we are not doing what we should, and wholly at sea about where our genuine purpose might lie.</p>
<p>The answer is patience and steadfast self-examination. We need some of the discipline of the detective, or an archaeologist reassembling the pieces of a smashed jar. We should not dismiss our angst blithely as ‘the Sunday blues’, to be assuaged with a drink and a film. We should see it as belonging to a confused, yet utterly central, search for a real self that has been buried under a need to please others and take care of short-term needs for status and money.</p>
<p>In other words, we should not keep our Sunday evening feelings simply for Sunday evenings. We should place these feelings at the centre of our lives and let them be the catalysts for a sustained exploration that continues throughout the week, over months and probably years, and that generates conversations with ourselves, with friends, with mentors and with professionals. Something very serious is going on when sadness and anxiety descend for a few hours on Sunday evenings. We aren’t simply a bit bothered because we have to end two days of leisure; we’re being made to suffer by a reminder to try to discover who we really are and to do justice to our talents before it is too late.</p>
