        <h2>8.Travel as a Cure for Shyness</h2>
<p>On the first day in Japan, it was truly difficult. You went into the corner shop just off the main Motomachi shopping street to buy a prepaid mobile card. You pointed at your phone, said ‘Hello, it’s me’, and mimed the actions of someone making a call. But it was useless. Mr Nishimura couldn’t understand you at all. You were hot and flustered (it was 30°C and pretty humid) and felt very young again and an unusually big idiot.</p>
<p>It evoked the time at school when you were supposed to make a speech and your mind went blank, and the painful evenings at college when everybody else seemed to be heading off somewhere and you weren’t sure if you could ask to join in.</p>
<p>Over the years, in your life back home, you have learned how to avoid situations of awkwardness. You have become an expert at working around your diffidence and your fear of being the unwelcome focus of attention. But, of course, there’s been a price to pay for your expertise at defensiveness. Whenever something feels alien or in any way threatening, your instinct has been to retreat, and you’ve missed out on a lot.</p>
<p>But now, in Japan, fitting in is no longer an option. You are the stupid foreigner. Of course you can’t know what you are supposed to do. Everyone stares at you wherever you go.</p>
<p>It sounds bad but, surprisingly, such extremity starts to offer you a certain sort of liberation. Maybe fitting in is overrated. Maybe not looking like a fool is simply not an option in any rich and interesting life, wherever it may unfold.</p>
<p>So you steel your nerves. You go back to the shop. You buy some wasabi-flavoured crisps and give the guy at the till a big smile. He grins back. You’re learning. You opt to rent an apartment near the elegant Sankeien Gardens from a really nice guy called Kazutaka. A few days after, you drop in on the shop again and buy a packet of Chokobi mini star-shaped chocolate biscuits (they look fun). You make a joke about the rain. You say ‘ame desu’ – which you’d practised after breakfast and hopefully means something like ‘it’s raining’ – and gesture drolly at your wet hair. Mr Nishimura beams at you.</p>
<p>Through travel, you’re freeing yourself from your inhibitions. You’re growing up – and into yourself. Our journeys can teach us a vital skill: that of not minding so much if we occasionally look a fool. They may be the best conduits for developing into the more confident, less self-conscious people we crave to be.</p>
