            <h3>¶ Tragedy</h3>
<p>Our fear of failure would not be so great were it not for an awareness of how often failure tends to be harshly viewed and interpreted by others. We fear not just poverty; we’re terrified of mockery and ridicule.</p>
<p>But there is one art form in particular that, since its inception, has dedicated itself to recounting stories of great failure without recourse to mockery or judgement. While not absolving people of responsibility for their actions, its achievement has been to offer to those involved in catastrophes – disgraced statesmen, murderers, the bankrupt, emotional compulsives – a level of sympathy owed, but rarely paid, to every human.</p>
<p>Tragic art began in the theatres of Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE. It followed a hero, usually a high-born one, a king or a famous warrior, from prosperity and acclaim to ruin and shame, through some error of his own. The way the story was told was likely to leave audience members at once hesitant to condemn the hero for what had befallen him and humbled by recognising how easily they too might be ruined if they were ever in a situation similar to the hero’s. The tragedy would leave them sorrowful before the difficulties of leading a good life and modest before those who had failed at the undertaking.</p>
<p>If a newspaper, with its language of perverts and weirdoes, failures and losers, lies at one end of the spectrum of understanding, then it is tragedy that lies at the other – attempting to build bridges between the guilty and the apparently blameless, challenging our ordinary conceptions of responsibility, standing as the most psychologically sophisticated, most respectful account of how a human being may be dishonoured, without at the same time forfeiting the right to be heard.</p>
<p>The tragedian draws us close to an almost unbearable truth: that every folly or blindness of which a human being has been guilty can be traced back to aspects of our own nature; that we bear within ourselves the whole of the human condition, in its worst and best aspects, so that we too might be capable of anything under the right (or very wrong) circumstances. Once an audience has been brought close to this fact, they may willingly dismount from their high horses and feel their powers of sympathy and humility enhanced; they may accept how easily their own lives could be shattered if certain of their more regrettable character traits, which had until then led to no serious accident, were one day to come into contact with a situation that allowed these flaws unlimited and catastrophic reign.</p>
<p>That the legendary failed characters of art seem noble to us has little to do with their qualities per se and almost everything to do with the way we have been taught to consider them by their creators and chroniclers.</p>
