            <h2>17 Science and Religion</h2>
<p>According to a standard heroic secular account, at the start of the modern age and in just a few short decades, science was able to defeat religion through rigour and brilliance — and thereby forever liberated humankind from ignorance and superstition. For centuries, this account explains, religion had essentially been doing some very bad science. It had purported to tell us how old the Earth was (4,000 years old), how many suns there were in the universe (one), how evolution had begun (by divine decree), and why rainbows existed (to remind us of God and Noah). But these lamentable attempts were finally put to an end when science was able to investigate reality with reason, assert itself against obscurantist priests, and drive religion into the cobwebbed attic in which it presently resides. Science did not so much replace religion (there was no need) as expunge the scourge altogether from human consciousness. As a result, we can now dwell without fear or meekness and enjoy the fruits of science and its constant, ever more astonishing, technological discoveries.</p>
<p>The story is seductive in its robustness and has a pleasingly victorious feel. But it may not be true. It willingly (and cleverly) misrepresents the purpose of religion, first by positioning it as an entity whose overwhelming focus has been to do pretty much exactly what science does — understand — and then by pointing out that it happened to do it very badly. Whereas science was wise enough to proceed with a battery of telescopes, pipettes, centrifuges, measuring gauges and equations, religion tried to interpret the workings of the universe with the help of one (in passages obviously demented) ancient book.</p>
<p>However, in truth, religion was never really interested in doing the things science does. It might have thrown out the odd theory about geology, it might occasionally have had things to say about meteorology or aeronautics, but its focus was never substantially on explanations of physical reality. It cared about a mission altogether different and more targeted: it wanted to tell us stories to make life feel more bearable. It was interested in giving us something to hold on to — in the face of terror, shame and regret, when there was panic and grief — that could help us to make it through to the next day. It offered us ideas with which we might resist the pull of viciousness and self-centredness. It hoped to encourage us to find perspective and lay a claim to serenity in the face of our too-often impossible and tragic mortal condition.</p>
<p>The defenders of science purported to miss all this, simply framing religion as a flawed and daft pioneering version of physics, chemistry and biology. But from the start of the nineteenth century, prescient observers understood that religion had always been something besides this, that it had taken care of the inner life of humanity and that its retreat would therefore have implications for far more than our grasp of physical reality. Though we might benefit from a hugely enhanced understanding of lightning or the features of the night sky, we might simultaneously be in danger of losing our central resource for coping with the agonies of existence. With only science to hand, what would happen to our need for consolation? What would we do with our night-time terrors? How could we reconcile ourselves to our mortality? Where would we be able to find peace and a semblance of contentment?</p>
<p>Science largely shrugged its shoulders. This was not its business; nor did these questions seem particularly pressing to many in the field. But others — perhaps more tormented and inwardly fragile — disagreed: they knew that whatever the state of scientific knowledge, humans never lose their need for stories that can make life feel more bearable. Knowing the boiling point of hydrogen (-252.87°C) will not mean that we promptly shed our appetite for consolation or perspective; understanding the structure of the atom in no way lessens our craving for something mature and psychologically soothing to hold on to in the middle of the night. For a rare period, this double need — for the consolations once offered by religion and for the truths revealed by science — was artfully held together in a way that it has never quite been before or since. In England, for three decades around the middle of the nineteenth century, from a variety of quarters, there was a range of highly suggestive attempts to rope aspects of science into the project of ethical and psychological healing pioneered by religion. These projects sought to mine science for its capacity to do precisely what religion had done so well for centuries: to guide us towards greater self-acceptance, serenity, forgiveness and peace of mind. Rather than dismissing the central functions of religion, science could, from this vantage point, skilfully and intelligently replace them.</p>
<p>The highpoint of this unusual approach was the foundation of two new institutions: Oxford’s University Museum of Natural History in 1860 and London’s Natural History Museum in 1881. Both set out to present the public with the latest discoveries of science: they showed off a treasury of vertebrates and invertebrates, rocks and minerals. They laid out stuffed bears, foxes and lions, bones of whales and megalosauruses, cabinets of rose-ringed parakeets and birds of paradise. One could peer at the preserved bodies of black seadevil fish and stoplight loosejaws (Malacosteus niger). There were fossilised ammonites and the imprints of brachiopods and (in London) 22,000 drawers filled with beetle specimens.</p>
<p>Yet the public wasn’t merely being given a lecture; it was being invited to find inspiration — not unlike the kind one might once have discovered in the annals of religion. The architecture made the concept particularly evident: both institutions looked indistinguishable from churches. Both were in the Romanesque style, with elaborate porticos, knaves and richly patterned columns. Both had high ceilings. In London, one could stand in the centre of the main hall, gaze up fifty-two metres and find, in place of depictions of the Apostles or the Holy Family, 162 panels laying out the Earth’s botanical wonders, from lemon trees to date palms, irises to rhododendrons, sunflowers to cotton plants.</p>

<p>The first director of the Natural History Museum, Sir Richard Owen, put the mission squarely into view: the museum was to be, in his words, a ‘cathedral’ to science. Here, too, one might pursue consolation, inspiration and perspective. Here, too, one might shed sorrows and cast aside ingratitude and despondency. The soul of modern humanity, battered by industrialisation, was being offered a new kind of balm. Science wasn’t dismissing our needs and cravings, our loneliness and fears. It was ready to help with a set of similarly structured, but just more rationally founded, answers.</p>

<p>The move was tantalising and salutary. But, for all the beauty of these early ‘cathedrals’, it did not catch on. As more science museums opened, they looked less and less like churches and more and more like regular institutions of learning, the sort of places one might come to if one was considering a career in biology or educating a child. For its part, science got on with its day-to-day task of finding out about the workings of the universe, our planet and all its varied inhabitants. It neglected the business of building any sort of bridge between its discoveries and the spiritual cravings of humankind. As a consequence, the alienation and disenchantment of modern life continued. The more desolate voices complained that though science might have turned out to be ‘true’, its victory left us inwardly hungry and forlorn.</p>
<p>The despair is unjustified. Properly viewed, science has never been the enemy of spiritual enrichment. Indeed, when we know how to approach it and are encouraged to do so (whether by architecture or art, literature or film), science will yield ideas every bit as consoling and inspiring, and as applicable to our lives and as relevant to our pains as those found in religion. The revelations of science do not have to mean an end to the project of therapeutic psychology initiated by religion; they can refashion, enhance and amplify it. This may not be how scientists themselves go about their work or present it to the public, but the fruit of this work lends itself impeccably to a mission of ethical-psychological elaboration.</p>
<p>We can, in other words, look to science for the sort of ideas we used to seek in religion, and that could assuage some of the ills of modernity. At least seven big ideas can be found...</p>
