            <h3>4 Forgiveness: evolution</h3>
<p>It’s tempting to lose our temper with ourselves and our fellow humans: why can we not be more reasonable? Why are we so prejudiced? Why do we worry so much what other people think? Why are we so prone to anxiety? Why do we eat so much? Why are we so interested in pornography?</p>
<p>It’s equally tempting to search for explanations that emphasise our villainous natures and then to harshly condemn our lack of self-command. We end up disgusted with ourselves and intemperate and judgemental towards others.</p>
<p>But science — far more effectively than religion — may teach us the art of forgiveness, and liberate us from our urge to criticise. Of course, we’re less than ideally adapted to the civilised and intellectually complex lives that we aspire to lead. Of course, we are largely demented, prey to powerful impulses, filled with dread and driven by lower appetites. We have had very little time to do or be anything else.</p>
<p>We are estimated to have appeared in more or less our current form in Africa 200,000 years ago. For most of this time, we lived in small groups, we foraged, we grunted, we didn’t wait for others to stop talking, we fought constantly, we were terrified of everything and understood almost nothing, we didn’t sit quietly in chairs for many hours, we didn’t wear tight-fitting clothes, we couldn’t read or write, we got very interested in any fertile human who came our way and we gorged ourselves whenever we found something sweet growing on a tree.</p>
<p>The time since the birth of Jesus comprises one per cent of our history; the last 250 years, the period since we became urbanised and began living with technology in scientific culture, encompasses a mere 0.1 per cent. Naturally, therefore, most of our impulses are askew and better suited to more basic conditions. It is a miracle we ever manage to be polite, to explain our feelings, to compromise and to see anything from another’s point of view.</p>

<p>From the vantage point of science, we’re doing extremely well. So much of our capacity for calm depends on our sense of what people should be like — and how well they succeed in measuring up to expectations. Evolutionary history teaches us that humans should be a lot worse than they are. Humanity is rushing to catch up with its ideals and we can afford to be rather more gentle towards its constant but inevitable lapses. The wonder isn’t, in the end, that we’re so uncivilised but that we ever manage, now and then, to have a few moments of civilisation.</p>
