        <h2>Fear and Money</h2>
<p>In many circles, those who work far more than they strictly need to and who strive with exceptional energy to accumulate as much money as possible are likely to be sneered at and lightly mocked. They may be dismissed as ‘workaholics’ and categorised as ‘greedy’.</p>
<p>However, the story gets more complicated if we allow ourselves to enter imaginatively into their experiences (and perhaps compare them to our own). We may return to the office earlier than we need to, and be at our desk every weekend, because idleness makes us intensely uncomfortable. A feeling of eeriness and dread tends to descend on holidays, yet when we are racing against a self-imposed deadline, when every hour is timetabled for the next six months, we feel exhausted but also harnessed and directed. We have a plan that appears to guide and protect us. Similarly, we know we may not need all the money we are saving up and we understand there is no urgent necessity to go on yet another exhausting business trip, but with every large invoice we send out, we anticipate a feeling of calm and well-being.</p>
<p>In other words, beneath the apparent ‘workaholism’ and ‘greed’, something more interesting and vulnerable is stirring: we are on a search for safety. We tire ourselves building up financial reserves because this promises to deliver us a sense of assurance that we long for with an intensity we may not quite understand. We’re not rapacious at all; we just feel in danger. Those who are particularly materially acquisitive are not vainer than the rest of us; they are simply far more frightened.</p>
<p>At a primal, unconscious level, money promises to be the conclusive answer to panic. With sufficient wealth, we sincerely believe that we can be at peace. We won’t have to be unnerved by people ever again, we won’t need to be surprised and terrified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is just enough truth in the longing to keep it alive for a lifetime. Money can – of course – on occasion spare us humiliation and difficulty. But its power is ultimately limited and always surpassed by our inner terror. The entrenched fear we wrestle with has a stubborn habit of enduring long after our most hopeful financial targets have been met. We might accumulate 100 or 500 million pounds and still – agonisingly – not be at peace. We may retire to a villa surrounded by a high wall patrolled by a private security firm and be sitting by an Olympic-sized pool sipping on an elderflower cordial, served to us by a kind and deferential servant, and still not feel safe. Four decades of constant labour may find us in a mansion in which we remain wracked by anxiety.</p>
<p>This paradox can only be explained by drilling into the roots of our original fear. As with most of our fears, an exorbitant longing for wealth is almost always generated by an experience of unmanageable let-down and humiliation in early life. People don’t acquire a craving for superabundant riches until – and unless – they suffer a catastrophe in their formative years that they are unable to process and make sense of. Wealth becomes one of the primary compensatory fantasies in cases of unmanageable emotional loss; with wealth there promises to be an end to the aching and the self-doubt, the anxiety and the despair. With wealth, there will never again be a misfortune that cannot be mastered.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly pursuing wealth, we should strive to remember, and to overcome, the original trauma that we suffered at the hands of others. We must keep in mind that we work harder than most because we were let down more than most – in a way that we have avoided focusing on all our adult lives. We need to find the sympathetic environment in which we can travel back in time to revisit our primal sorrow: the father who abandoned us, the mother who was too busy to care for us, the grandmother who mocked us. None of our financial skills will serve any useful purpose in terms of reducing panic until we can reconnect with the frightened little child we once were – and bring them the understanding and emotional reassurance they lacked. That will make us feel safe in a way no mansion ever can.</p>
<p>There is another, parallel solution to our woes that should also be pursued. We acquired a sense of being in danger – and grew financially desperate – because of a failure in our relations with a few significant others. Logically, therefore, the way to recover a feeling of safety will be via our relationships, though these will be of a very different kind. Whereas the experiences and emotions that damaged us were disappointment, abandonment and emotional coldness, so what will make us feel well and safe again will be reliability, closeness, tenderness and loyalty. We must repair the damage to our psyches with the very same tool that was used to scar us.</p>
<p>Mansions and expensive toys have their pleasures. But what they should never be mistaken for are routes to safety and emotional ease. We should not be surprised if we remain stressed and anxious despite our wealth. Instead, we must look back to our early betrayals and find proper emotional compensation through true treasure: people who are able to love us properly.</p>
