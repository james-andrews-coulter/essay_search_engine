        <h3>1. Self-Knowledge</h3>
<p>Socrates, the earliest and greatest of philosophers, summed up the purpose of philosophy in one resonant phrase: ‘know yourself’. A capacity for self-knowledge is at the heart of our inclinations to forgiveness, kindness, creativity and wise decision-making, especially around love and work. Unfortunately, knowing ourselves is the (always unfinished) task of a lifetime. We are permanently elusive and mysterious to ourselves. We have to catch our real intentions and feelings obliquely, with some of the patience of a lepidopterist.</p>
<p>One of the tasks of culture is to offer us tools to assist us with the task of self-knowledge. We need a vocabulary to name feelings and states of mind; we need encouragement to be alone with ourselves at regular moments; we need friends and professionals who will listen to us with editorial precision and sympathy, and we need works of art that can illuminate elusive aspects of our psyches.</p>
<p>Above all, we need to be modest about our capacity easily to understand who we are and what we want. We should nurture a stance of scepticism towards many of our first impulses and beliefs and submit all our significant plans to extensive rational cross-examination.</p>
<p>Failures of self-knowledge lie behind some of our gravest individual and collective disasters.</p>
