            <h3>4. The occasional friend</h3>
<p>Scenario one</p>
<p>It’s just gone 11 p.m. and the last customers are leaving the restaurant. Roberto and Jamal give each other a hug after a wonderful evening and jump into different taxis. It will probably be at least a couple of weeks, and maybe longer, before they meet face to face again; they’ve been good friends for a few years and always relish their times together, talking intensely for three or four hours before going their separate ways.</p>
<p>According to Romantic ideology – as it evolved from the late 18th century onwards and has come to dominate modern thinking – friendship is a kind of failed relationship: true love means wanting to be with someone all the time. The fact that Roberto and Jamal only see each other occasionally is, by this standard, second-best. Jamal’s romantically inclined sister thinks it’s a great pity he never got together with Roberto and that they would have made a great couple.</p>
<p>Scenario two</p>
<p>It’s just gone 11 p.m. and the last customers are leaving the restaurant. Roberto and Jamal get silently into the same taxi, heading home together. They’ve been married for three years; they both like the idea of going out to dinner, hoping it might rekindle some of the intensity of their early days, but often they end up just talking through the routines of domestic life or co-ordinating their diaries – and not infrequently enduring long silences, perhaps because so many matters have gradually become contentious between them.</p>
<p>According to a more Classical tradition of thought, one of the glories of friendship is that it is a part-time occupation. It’s not merely practical limitations of time and opportunity that restrict how often Jamal and Roberto get together: there’s an underlying wisdom. From the Classical perspective, what we really appreciate and delight in the other gets swamped by constant exposure to the things we don’t like about each other. To be loved for what’s best in us, a degree of distance may be necessary.</p>
<p>As friends, much of what the other is like doesn’t actually matter. As friends, it’s irrelevant that Roberto tends to leave milk cartons in the fridge well beyond their use-by date, though if they were together full-time, this attitude would infuriate Jamal. And Roberto doesn’t care that Jamal colour-matches all his books, though he’s slightly stunned to see the reality – a guide to restaurants in France next to a copy of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason because both happen to have red covers. And this is only to begin the list of matters over which they would contend were they to try to share the whole of their lives. Meeting only in restaurants, they can concentrate on the specific, and very real, things that delight them about one another.</p>
<p>In artistic terms, a friendship can be likened to a beautiful sketch. A great portraitist might capture a key aspect of someone in a few lines; it’s not that they were too uncaring or too lazy to record every detail – they weren’t trying to do that. They wanted to immortalise a glance, a posture, a tilt of the head, a way of gesturing. To be a friend is to be a sketching artist: it is to select out of all the things one could concentrate on what it is best to concentrate on.</p>
<p>It has to be admitted, though, that even in the limited arena of a restaurant encounter, with the comforts of a langoustine salad and a glass of Chablis, there are still irritants. Roberto winces slightly at the sight of Jamal’s floral shirt and Jamal has to hold his tongue when Roberto mentions, in all seriousness, someone’s star sign.</p>
<p>There’s a rather specific character to minor irritants: their power to drive us crazy depends on their frequency. A small frustration stays just that – small and bearable – if it is met only at well-spaced intervals. The problem is constant repetition. An occasional gust makes a tree bend, but then it comes back into shape and continues to grow upright; a constant wind distorts the entire structure.</p>
<p>In the two or three weeks they have apart, Jamal and Roberto easily regain their mental suppleness and can meet afresh. Neither is overburdened, or hurt, by the shortcomings of the other. They can afford to overlook a small failing (as each sees it) to which they are rarely exposed.</p>
<p>Their friendship is deeply important to both of them – one of the loveliest things in their lives. And yet they have maintained their love for each other so well and for so long because their encounters are brief, occasional and intensely apprehended.</p>
<p>An occasional friendship meets our need to be loved for our own merits, without our failings getting in the way.</p>
