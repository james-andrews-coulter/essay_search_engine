            <h3>¶ Artistic Rebalancing</h3>
<p>Few of us are entirely well ‘balanced’. Our psychological histories, relationships and working routines mean that many of our emotions incline a little too much in one direction or another.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is an issue that culture is well placed to help us with, for works of art can put us powerfully in touch with concentrated doses of our missing dispositions, and thereby restore a measure of equilibrium to our listing inner selves.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have fallen into a way of life that suffers from too much intensity, stimulation and distraction. Work is frantic across three continents. The inbox is clogged with two hundred messages every hour. There is hardly time to reflect on anything once the day starts. This explains why we might be powerfully drawn to a minimalist interior, where things appear calm, logical and reduced to their essence. This is our true home, from which our way of life has exiled us.</p>
<p>John Pawson, The Life House, 2016.</p>
<p>A minimalist interior offers quiet beauty to balance out over-stimulation.</p>
<p>But because we are not all missing the same things, the kinds of art that have a capacity to rebalance us, and therefore arouse enthusiasm in us, will differ markedly. Imagine we happen to be a bureaucrat in one of the sleepier branches of the Norwegian civil service based in the idyllic though rather quiet town of Trondheim near the Arctic Circle. Our days run like clockwork. We are always home by 5.15pm and do the crossword before bed. The last thing we may be attracted to is a pristinely ordered home by John Pawson. We might be drawn instead to Flamenco music, the paintings of Frida Kahlo and the architecture of Mexico’s Catedral de Santa Prisca – varieties of art to restore life to our slumbering souls.</p>
<p>Façade of the Catedral de Santa Prisca y San Sebastian, Taxco, Mexico, constructed 1751–1758.</p>
<p>Art to rebalance an over-quiet soul.</p>
<p>Edmund Blair Leighton, The End of the Song, 1902.</p>
<p>Art to rebalance oneself after too many railways, factories and readings of Darwin.</p>
<p>Jacques-Louis David, The Oath of the Horatii, 1784.</p>
<p>Art to rebalance oneself after overindulgence in mistresses, gold and parties.</p>
<p>Whole nations can manifest longings for balance and will use art to help them achieve it. After too much aristocratic decadence, many in late 18th-century France felt the need to get back in touch with marshal solemnity and spartan simplicity and so found refuge in the pared-down works of Jacques-Louis David.</p>
<p>By the later part of the 19th century in England, the materialism, scientific obsession and capitalist rationality of the age drove many to long for more faithful, mystical days, and so to locate ‘beauty’ in the images inspired by the literature and history of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>What we call ‘beautiful’ is any work of art that supplies a missing dose of a much-needed psychological component, and we dismiss as ‘ugly’ one that forces on us moods or motifs by which we feel threatened or are already overwhelmed. Our contact with art holds out the promise of inner wholeness.</p>
