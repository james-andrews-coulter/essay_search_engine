            <h3>Exile</h3>
<p>It’s a rather odd motive for travel; we don’t much hear of it as a reason why someone would decamp to another corner of the world. We’re familiar with a search for better weather, for richer work opportunities, for greater proximity to family … But what isn’t mentioned is that we might be impelled to move because we are simply too exhausted and internally weighed down – by people’s stares, by the words that we know will be exchanged every time we leave a room or a shop, by the 10,000-ton ‘story’ we are invisibly dragging around behind us at every step.</p>
<p>What can be appealing about another country is the sheer indifference of the population. They – blessedly – are too preoccupied with their own dramas to give a damn about us. Their newspapers – written in a language we don’t understand – are filled with quite different stories; here there are other actors, politicians, business people and lovers getting in trouble in different ways. Here we can lose ourselves in the crowd. First and foremost, we are just another foreigner. The details of our story don’t matter. Aside from a few exceptions, the people don’t expect to get to know us; we are merely ‘the outsider’ – we stand outside of their status system and hierarchies of respect and honour.</p>
<p>So, finally, we can be left in peace. We can sit in a cafe with the local beverage or soup and watch an unfamiliar world go by. There will be different sorts of barbers, the people will shop in quite different ways and the streets will be filled with other aromas.</p>
<p>In the olden days, all that would have been needed was to go over to another valley or to the next city along. Nowadays, we may have to move a whole continent or two. We are often asked to celebrate how small the world has become; what a little village it is, thanks to our planes and technologies – but what a burden villages can be the moment there is gossip, scandal or failure. It is a true luxury that there still exist different areas in the world that care not as much for one another as they eventually will. The human mind can’t hold all the defeats of every member of the species in mind at one moment; failure remains relatively local if we are fortunate. Once upon a time, we’d have taken a ship to San Francisco or Sydney. With what gratitude we’d have sailed past Bradley’s Head to set up home in Kurraba Point, where we could admire the eucalyptus trees and the sound of spotted pardalotes; how lucky we would have been that it took six months for the London newspaper to arrive, and even then, they might leave out the more gossipy bits – or not connect the dots. How claustrophobic the internet and the plane have rendered our lives. One day, there may be different planets to head to, and we can be first in line for a trip to Pluto or for the colonisation of Neptune. We are in a strange and sad interregnum: the planet increasingly too small for failure, the universe still closed for escape. But even now, there are teeming capital cities at far ends of the globe that can provide refuge – places that we will be able to call home not because we speak the language or understand the ways, but precisely because we will be total aliens and because in such obscurity who we really are has a chance to emerge, shielded from the constant stares and violent hatreds of our native villages.</p>
