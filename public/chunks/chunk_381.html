        <h4>4. Creativity</h4>
<p>‘Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school for genius,’ wrote Edward Gibbon.</p>
<p>Of all the claimed rewards of being alone, this is perhaps the easiest to ‘get’. It seems rather obvious that great art, great original thinking, any creative work, needs to be done
  in some degree of solitude. What is more, all the creators tell us so – from Franz Kafka to William Wordsworth; from Werner Heisenberg to Beatrix Potter; from Georgia O’Keefe to Ludwig
  Wittgenstein (just to take a tiny range). It seems a universal truth, and it mirrors our own smaller experimental performances. But actually it is slightly odd, because, as Anthony Storr puts it,
  ‘Art is communication . . . explicitly or implicitly the work which [is produced] in solitude is aimed at somebody.’</p>
<p>We seldom inspect this paradox, because the reality is so self-evident. Kafka wrote to his fiancée:</p>
<p>You say you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess, that utmost of
    self-revelation and surrender . . . that is why one can never be alone enough when one writes . . . why even night is not night enough.</p>
<p>(You may not be very surprised to learn that, shortly after this, they broke off the engagement!)</p>
<p>The poet Rainer Maria Rilke advised a younger poet,</p>
<p>What is needed is . . . a vast inner loneliness. To walk in one’s self and to meet no one for hours on end. That is what one must be able to attain . . . looking out
    from the depths of one’s own world from the expanse of one’s own aloneness which is itself work and rank and profession.</p>
<p>In A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf argues very convincingly that the reason there were so few great women writers is that it was so difficult for them to be
  alone: a writer needed a room of her own and enough money to occupy it. Women were not lacking in talent, intelligence, energy or imagination – they were lacking in solitude, in the chance to
  be alone for long enough to be creative. Later Woolf goes on to try and work out why solitude mattered so much to creativity. She suggests that every woman is haunted by a sort of inner ghost,
  which she calls ‘the angel in the house’ (after a Victorian poem of that name by Coventry Patmore extolling his wife as the ideal woman). Woolf describes the perfect woman as</p>
<p>intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed daily. If there was a chicken,
    she took the leg; if there was a draught she sat in it . . . Above all, she was pure.</p>
<p>Emily Dickinson: Great original thinking, any creative work, needs to be done in some degree of solitude.</p>
<p>This angel-ghost prevented a woman from doing anything so assertive and ‘aggressive’ as truly creative work. But Woolf goes on to suggest that this
  ‘angel’ was a social construct (in the interests of husbands, fathers and men more generally) and an imaginative projection. In order to ‘kill the angel’, which Woolf
  considered both necessary and difficult, you had to get away from all the people who were projecting, were constructing the would-be writer, not as writer but as an ‘intensely
  sympathetic’, ‘pure’ and ‘unselfish’ woman. To get away from them all you had to be alone.</p>
<p>At first sight this might seem to apply only to women – and certainly the ‘angel in the house’ is a peculiarly female problem – but I think that perhaps everyone, even
  the notably introverted Kafka, is haunted by an inner ghost who undermines creativity by implying that there are better things to do with your time, asking sarcastically who you think you are and
  preaching modesty and humility and ‘unselfishness’, or the social duty to get rich, help other people and be a good team-player or other social obligations. If these are really social
  constructs which we have internalized they tie very neatly into our society’s negative views about solitude: the two reinforce each other.</p>
<p>It is difficult to create any solid theory about the human imagination, how it is triggered into action of any kind, and what might be done to develop and strengthen it. But anecdotally, and in
  almost all biographies of creative artists and scientists, periods alone seem to be crucial.</p>
<p>Werner Heisenberg wrestled for some years with the theoretical question of how to model the atom to take into account the mathematical problems which seemed to distort all the data. He talked at
  length with his friends and other experts; they seemed to get nowhere and he was intensely frustrated. And then in 1925 he had the ‘good luck’ to suffer a violent attack of hay fever;
  to recover from this he went off on his own to Heligoland (an island in the North Sea, famous for its absence of pollen). And there he was alone. And alone he came up, very quickly, with his Theory
  of Imprecision (now normally called the Uncertainty Principle). It was a profoundly creative piece of physics, and it challenged and inspired many of the people whom he had been talking to
  beforehand. It opened the door for one of the most creative few years that modern physics has ever known: Quantum Mechanics sprang into existence because of Heisenberg’s hay fever and the
  solitude it imposed on him.</p>
<p>If you feel any identification with Heisenberg’s frustrations, in any creative area, you do not need to have a major allergic reaction; you can just go off on your own and see if it helps.
  Solitude is a well-established ‘school for genius’, and the outpouring of creativity is one of its promised joys. In learning to be solitary and happy with it, you can prepare yourself
  for this sort of creativity.</p>
