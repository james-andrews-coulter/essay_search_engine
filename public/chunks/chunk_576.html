            <h3>¶ Cultural Mining</h3>
<p>Cultural mining describes the process by which the most valuable parts of culture – by which we mean the arts, humanities and philosophy – are recovered from their original contexts and made useful for our own times.</p>
<p>In cultural mining, the refined and practical essence of culture is carefully extracted, cleaned, blasted and remoulded, then used to manufacture those ideas that can best help us to navigate contemporary life.</p>
<p>It has been a historic problem of substantial proportions that hugely valuable cultural insights have often been lodged within highly unappealing material far below ‘ground’. It has been dark and cramped in the corridors of culture and hardly anyone other than certain accredited experts has been tempted or allowed to visit. Their labours have had a lot of prestige, but in truth, the material has been like metal in ore: impractical in its raw state.</p>
<p>For culture to be of use to us, it needs to go through a process of refinement, which may involve radical, even drastic, editorial moves. Insights have to be forcefully separated from contexts and then twinned with real-world issues. They must be translated from an arcane language of the deep into a spoken language of the surface. Finally, as in gold mining, only a very small portion of what was originally dug out will ever be usable to make the finished precious item that is sought: in this case, a good idea.</p>
<p>By being treated with immense reverence, and refusing any quick extraction of their essential wisdom, works of culture risk becoming painfully inert in our world. If the genius of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason can be grasped only by those who fully comprehend it, then its audience will be reduced to a handful of individuals who have spent their lives mastering the details and cannot preach their wisdom except in terms that are baffling and useless to humanity in general.</p>
<p>The cultural miner knows that preciousness will be the downfall of the best ideas, and is devoted to overcoming its effects.</p>
<p>The School of Life practises Cultural Mining.</p>
