            <h2>III.  Engagement</h2>
<p>You’re on your way home from a busy day at work, feeling pleasantly tired and hoping that your partner will have started preparing a nice supper. The day passed in an odd time-zone – both very fast, and without any sense of hurry – as you concentrated on the research for an inventive new company project, had a nice chat with colleagues over lunch and went on to present your findings to a sizeable group of listeners. The project is important to you, and you spoke about it eloquently. A little while ago, all of this would have been difficult and stressful, but on this occasion, you moved through the day’s paces gracefully and alertly, falling into neither lethargy nor anxiety. As you approach your home, looking forward to a pre-dinner drink, you try to identify your state, and after a while you realize what it is: you’re feeling rather pleased with the day; satisfied with what you’ve accomplished and excited about the project’s – and your own – prospects. Perhaps, you think, you’re actually feeling … happy.</p>
<p>*   *   *</p>
<p>We humans are integrated systems. Our minds and emotions, our capacity for sensuous relish and aesthetic appreciation, our curiosity about the world and our need for contemplative enchantment, all work in concert and cannot be separated from each other. It is only when we give ourselves a chance to nurture all of our faculties and ways of understanding the world that we can begin to feel ourselves to be rich in internal resources, and to experience richly. And it is when we allow ourselves occasionally to step away from the constant barrage of external stimuli, and orient ourselves within our internal and external landscapes, that we can begin to be motivated from within – to distinguish our own desires and preferences from the seductions of instant gratification, to discern what matters to us and what we want to discard, to understand what we really value and want – that is, to make choices which are truly informed, and which we can affirm as ours.</p>
<p>For this, we need time out. But most of don’t want to remain on idle permanently. We want to use our energies, rather than let them lie fallow; and once we have given ourselves time to renew and deepen our perceptions and selves, we are better able to gather all of our resources and return to more active forms of experience with a full and conscious sense of engagement. I believe such engagement is what most of us desire in our lives, and in this section I will try to describe what it consists of, and some of the forms it can take in our societies today.</p>
<p>What is it like, what does it feel like, to be completely involved in something? Perhaps one way to put it is that it involves the ability to bring all of ourselves to an activity or an experience, without scepticism or withholding, and to focus our attention entirely on an object or a task. That requires having all of ourselves at our disposal in the first place, as well as making deliberate decisions about what we choose to do; but it also calls for a kind of self-confidence which allows us to become entirely absorbed in an activity or process of thought, without distraction or ambivalence, and sometimes to the point of ‘losing ourselves’ within it – or at least, losing our ordinary self-consciousness.</p>
<p>One interesting suggestion as to what constitutes pleasurable engagement comes from the unpronounceably named sociologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his theory of ‘flow’ – an idea which has been taken up by many others, in various disciplines. In his book, entitled simply Flow, he connects this highly enjoyable state to being entirely absorbed in certain kinds of activities, and he specifies several factors which are necessary to achieving it. The task we are performing needs to be experienced as purposeful and meaningful, so that we embark on it with full willingness; it needs to be challenging enough to keep us on the qui vive, so to speak, and at the edge of our abilities; but it cannot be so demanding that we feel we cannot do it, which only results in frustration. In states of flow, we often lose our sense of ordinary clock-time; a moment might expand as we home in on a detail, or several hours pass as we concentrate on solving a problem.</p>
<p>The activities which meet the conditions for engagement come in many varieties. Here, I will look at just a few of them.</p>
