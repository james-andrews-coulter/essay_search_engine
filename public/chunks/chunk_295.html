            <h2>II. Leisure</h2>
<p>Leisure: The Basis of Culture by Josef Pieper is an eccentric but fascinating book written by a religiously inclined philosopher, wherein he argues that leisure is the foundation of Western culture, and of its philosophic tradition – and that modernity has supplanted this ideal with the tyranny not so much of work itself, as the ideology of work. Even thinking, Pieper argues, has become reformulated as ‘intellectual work’, rather than being understood as the capacity for contemplation and wonder – for the authentic ‘philosophic act’. ‘Leisure’ is so outside the mainstream of our current thinking as to be thought-provoking.</p>
<p>‘In Praise of Idleness’ by Bertrand Russell is a diverting, rather dandyish essay, arguing that we have overdone the ethos of work, and that we would be much better off working only four hours a day.</p>
<p>For the processes of introspection, there is a large body of psychoanalytic classics, to stimulate thinking about the patterns of internal life. Freud is a wonderful writer, and his case studies read like intriguing detective fictions, pursuing clues contained in symptoms and dreams, to get at deeper psychic truths.</p>
<p>A Life of One’s Own by Marion Milner (aka Joanna Field) is a beguiling account of one person’s attempt to understand herself, and to disentangle her own desires, preferences and sources of pleasure from the cultural pressures and imperatives which have formed her. In An Experiment in Leisure, she continues to examine herself with the aid of images which have been important to her – from mythology, religion, art and her own memory. A wonderful companion to one’s own experiments in self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Adam Phillips’s many books and essays are stylish, often whimsical, and informed by literature and philosophy as much as by psychoanalysis. Darwin’s Worms is an extended meditation on the need to accept mortality as part of our human condition, and in order to value more intensely the time we actually have in our lives. Going Sane is valuable for affirming the temperate state of sanity and the pleasures of normalcy, against assumptions about the ‘creative’ value of neurosis and extreme mental states.</p>
<p>For a more scientific approach to the mind’s ways, Antonio Damasio’s Self Comes to Mind is a fluently written and rigorously argued investigation of the complex interactions between feelings and meanings, emotions and the brain, in the construction of consciousness and sense of self. Damasio is a neuroscientist who is interested in the human psyche, and his account of how our perceptions and selves are constructed makes for stimulating reading.</p>
<p>Gerald Edelman’s Wider Than the Sky is a meticulous analysis of the neurological processes which go into the basic act of being conscious – with some mysteries still unsolved.</p>
<p>In a fictional vein, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse captures lyrically and precisely the movements of her characters’ minds, in states of reverie, free-association, and moments of contemplative epiphany.</p>
<p>Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past is of course one of the greatest and most beautiful literary meditations on the strata of memory, and the presence of the past within us. Its several volumes can be savoured over several holidays, or as a reading pleasure for a year.</p>
<p>There are countless books on the pleasures and merits of reading, music and art. This is a very arbitrary selection of texts which bring to these age-old themes some contemporary concerns.</p>
<p>Alberto Manguel’s A History of Reading is a compendious and enjoyably digressive history of this activity, showing how the manners and morals of reading have changed over the centuries (it took a while for people to learn how to read silently!), and why the act of reading is so important to the development of literature, the life of cultures and the cultured life.</p>
<p>Stop What You’re Doing and Read This! is a collection of ten essays by contemporary writers on the importance of reading actual books. Passionate, personal and varied in their approach, the essays remind us why reading matters, why it is so enriching, and why it is an essential form of connection to others, and to the world.</p>
<p>The Aesthetic Brain: How We Evolved to Desire Beauty and Enjoy Art by Anjan Chatterjee is a neuroscientist’s up-to-date take on the aesthetic impulse. Chatterjee clearly appreciates and enjoys art, and his theory of ‘neuroaesthetics’ combines the idea of integrated perception with the proposition that our responses to art are ravelled with other forms of pleasure – in food, sex, and even money.</p>
<p>Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks is an examination of musical cognition, why and how music is so deeply embedded in the brain and memory, and why it has such powerful effects on us, for good and sometimes ill. Sacks was a neurologist with a flair for the quirky case study, and here, he gives some diverting examples of both the disturbances of the musical sense, and instances of surprising musical ability. He is particularly moving on the power of music to heal, and to sustain a sense of self in the face of its loss.</p>
<p>The Singing Neanderthals by Steven Mithen is a fascinating book, drawing together evidence from archaeology to child psychology, and the study of birdsong and primate communication systems, to posit the hypothesis that music precedes spoken language and leads to its development.</p>
<p>On the process of making choices and decisions, I particularly like Avner Offer’s The Challenge of Affluence – a thought-provoking sociological study of how an excess of choices in various areas of life affects our ability to make decisions, control our impulses, or commit ourselves to long-term goals. Rife with statistics and case studies, this is nevertheless a readable book about the challenges to well-being paradoxically posed by affluence – and it is suggestive about the need for some self-control and long-term thinking.</p>
