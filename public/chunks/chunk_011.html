        <h3>7. A friend to be silly with</h3>
<p>Jasmine and Sigrid have a particular game that’s been evolving for a while between them; it started when Jasmine had been binge-watching Pingu, the TV programme about a little penguin who speaks a fabulous made-up language, with her daughter. Now the two 40-year-olds have immensely serious-seeming discussions in their own version of nonsense. The topic will be something like the first moon landing. Full of nail-biting intensity, Sigrid will do the countdown – botti, sin, solo, weewoo – then theatrical awe – strodo tintoe, leepa leepa proudy fleebydom.</p>
<p>A problematic point that needs to be admitted from the start is that we are all in our hearts irremediably silly. We are lots of other things too: serious, noble-minded, generous, hardworking, loyal, intelligent … and yet all the time we are on the verge of damaging everything (in our own eyes) thanks to the occasional but massive eruption of our essential idiocy. One said that to someone at a party; one walked straight into a glass door; one says ‘one’ idiotically often. We are so aware of our own foolishness. We are so grievously cut off from that of others.</p>
<p>Today Jasmine (divorce lawyer) and Sigrid (hydraulics engineer) are mock-analysing Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. It calls for frowning stares as they wrestle with huge assertions: weary job fog, chatty nainai [agonised pause to confront the imaginary insight] chimp dump sinner ordo poop shack. It’s all terribly silly – and a delightful bond.</p>
<p>The silly and the serious are not, as we tend to suppose, enemies. The more beautifully refined, cultured and well-presented we are, the more we need open silliness in our lives. Because, ironically, the more anxiously we guard our dignity, the more fragile it becomes. The glorious sign of security is that we know perfectly well that we can be both wise and fools at the same time. There are few sweeter things than witnessing an elegantly accommodating response to human ineptitude: the perfectly attired individual who laughs (and invites others to join in) when they spill a cocktail down their gown; the premier or president who is tender and humorous and kindly helpful when the mortified waiter drops a tray.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes we hold ourselves together; we keep our private madness and incapacity secret as best we can. But what we fear is that others will realise that – despite our talents and successes – we are very, very silly individuals. The ideal silly friend is someone who normally presents as serious and in control but who is willing to be idiotic with us.</p>
<p>Jasmine and Sigrid have taken aim at an existential target. When in a plenary address to the National Eﬃciency Forum Sigrid lightly mispronounces the word ‘focus’ (it comes out as ‘fuck-us’), she’s not abashed. When Jasmine, with an over-enthusiastic gesture, flicks her bundle of notes onto the floor of the district court, she reacts with good-humoured aplomb. No one now can possibly see them as more ridiculous or more nonsensical than they have – blissfully – acknowledged themselves to be.</p>
<p>We need the notion of inoculation. We take a manageable dose of a malady and it reinforces our capacity to cope with the worst, full version when it comes. We acknowledge, in the safety of friendship, how far we are from being the rational, perfectly capable creatures of our fantasies, and the public revelation of the inglorious truth arrives not so much as a humiliation as an extension of a familiar joke. And so, we respond to our stumbles and follies with the modest grace and good humour that is amongst the sweetest and most loveable answers to the conundrum of being human.</p>
<p>A silly friendship meets our need to happily acknowledge, and thus disarm, our secret understanding of our own existential idiocy.</p>
