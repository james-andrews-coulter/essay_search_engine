        <h3>Gallows humour</h3>
<p>After we experience failure, we may start to laugh more often – not in a jolly, light-hearted kind of way, but from a humour based on the tragic and dark gulf between how we would want things to be and how they have turned out. We’ll joke about despair and terror: we’ll become practitioners of ‘gallows humour’. Mostly, the jokes we make will be at our own expense. There will be so much in our lives that people think is too sad to mention: that almost all our friends have ditched us, that our name is all over the internet, that our children don’t speak to us. The normal response in these cases is usually to skirt the issue. One can fall prey to the vain superstition that if one doesn’t bring up an unfortunate fact, it might just fade away of its own accord. But not mentioning sadness is also what lets it win its sapping victories over us. We suffocate from timidity around our griefs. The strategy of gallows humour is different; it is usefully and gloriously defiant. It insists on mentioning the grim aspects of life and our situations, asserting control over them through mordant, dry commentary. In the Middle Ages, a tradition began in which the condemned, standing on the scaffold before their demise, would turn to the crowd and make a witticism about their situation. Sigmund Freud recounts a man being led out to be hung at dawn saying, ‘Well, the day is certainly starting well.’ Gallows humour is not squeamish about looking bleakness straight in the eye. Rather than being slowly gnawed at by sideways glances at the truth, the gallows humourist insists that they will not be silenced by it – they roll their sleeves up and grab it tenaciously. In these circumstances, laughter becomes a kind of grateful relief at witnessing our most shameful secrets handled with such reassuringly confident sangfroid. We might cheerfully exclaim: ‘In the days when I wasn’t thought worse than Adolf H. …’ or, ‘Being alive is still marginally better than being dead, but it’s a close-run thing …’ Gallows humour resists the temptation to complain earnestly. By frankly referring to something appalling, we can bolster our capacity not to be crushed by it. We don’t need to be great comics to generate gallows humour. The technique follows a simple pattern: we just need to head directly for the saddest, most taboo sides of our failed lives, remain utterly unflinching in front of them – and deliver understated, breezy, unruffled responses. Gallows humour edges the worst facts of our lives into a zone of bearable conversation. It allows us to joke about what we could otherwise never say straight out. It is a technique to stop us being destroyed by silence.</p>
