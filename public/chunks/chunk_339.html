        <h3>3 The resilience of life: five mass extinctions</h3>
<p>It can be easy to fall into worry about whether we, and most of what matters to us, will endure. The kindest advice is not to imply that all is assured and that a cataclysm can be averted; it’s to understand how common wholesale destruction has been on our planet and to be cheered by the thought that, nevertheless, life has endured, for it is ultimately a far more tenacious process than any cellular being in which it happens to subsist at a specific point. Individuals and species may die; life itself survives (at least until the Sun burns out).</p>
<p>We are standing on the petrified remains and fossilised bodies of thousands of species that came before us. By extension, many more will come after us. From a sufficient distance, we are not the end point and therefore should not cling so anxiously to what presently exists. We should learn to identify with the long-term direction of the river, and not grasp so tightly to our own fragile vessels bobbing unsteadily in the turbulent eddies of the present. There have been five mass extinctions afflicting multicellular life in the last 540 million years. Earth is a risky place and always has been. We’re not living in especially tempestuous times; peace is just an illusory by-product of short-term thinking. 450 million years ago, the Ordovician mass extinction, caused by a mini-ice age, caused the planet to lose seventy per cent of all its species, including most trilobites, brachiopods, crinoids and graptolites. 375 million years ago, another seventy per cent of species were lost in the Devonian extinction. In the huge Permian extinction 252 million years ago, ninety-five per cent of marine and seventy per cent of terrestrial species vanished (among them the fin-backed reptiles called pelycosaurs and the vast mammal-like creatures known as moschops). But life went on — as it always does.</p>
<p>Gradually, cellular existence built itself up again and a semblance of serenity appeared to reign on Earth. But that was an illusion too: 201 million years ago came the Triassic extinction (triggered by the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea). In the process, gone were the brachiopods, the shelled cephalopods, and the phytosaurs. Lastly, and most famously, came the Cretaceous extinction, 65.5 million years ago, which did away with the dinosaurs, the flying pterosaurs, the mosasaurs, the plesiosaurs and the graceful ichthyosaurs.</p>
<p>We should not expect our particular life form to endure. We are writing in time in fading ink. We will eventually go, but life itself will stubbornly persevere: within a few hundred million years, a creature comparable to us, but perhaps a little kinder and a lot more intelligent, may replace us and will spend weekends looking at our remains with a mixture of pity and boredom in the display cabinets of a new generation of scientific cathedrals.</p>
