        <h3>¶ Secrets in Love</h3>
<p>Our ideal of Romantic love has at its heart the notion that a truly good relationship is one in which we are able to tell a partner everything.</p>
<p>At last, there will be no more need for the usual hypocrisies. We will be able to come clean about so much that we had previously needed to keep to ourselves: our reservations about our friends; our irritation over small but wounding remarks by colleagues; our interest in rarely mentioned sexual practices. Love seems founded on the idea of radical disclosure.</p>
<p>But gradually, we stand to become aware of so much we cannot say. It might be around sex: on a work trip we flirted with a colleague and nearly let our hand touch theirs; we discovered a porn site that beautifully targeted a special quirk of our erotic imagination; we find our partner’s brother or sister very alluring. Or the secret thoughts can be more broad-ranging: the blog they wrote for work, about their experience in client care, was very boring; they are putting on weight around their waist; their best friend from school, to whom they are still loyal, is (in our view) excessively silly and dull; in the wedding photo of their parents (lovingly displayed in a silver frame in the living room) their mother looks very smug.</p>
<p>Love begins with a hope of unburdening ourselves entirely and overcoming loneliness forever. The initial relief of honesty is at the heart of the feeling of being ‘in love’. But this sharing of secrets sets up in our minds – and in our collective culture – a hugely problematic ideal: that if two people love one another, they must always tell each other the truth about everything.</p>
<p>The idea of honesty is sublime. It presents a deeply moving vision of how two people can be together, and it is a constant presence in the early months. But in order to be kind, and in order to sustain love, it ultimately becomes necessary to keep many thoughts out of sight.</p>
<p>Keeping secrets can seem like a betrayal of the relationship. At the same time, the complete truth invariably places any union in mortal danger. Much of what we’d ideally like to have recognised and confirmed is going to be genuinely disturbing even to someone who is fond of us.</p>
<p>We face a choice between honesty and acceptability and – for reasons that deserve a great deal of sympathy – mostly we choose the latter. We are perhaps too conscious of the bad reasons for hiding something; we haven’t paid enough attention to the noble reasons why, from time to time, true loyalty may lead us to say very much less than the whole truth. We are so impressed by honesty that we have forgotten the virtues of politeness – this word defined not as a cynical withholding of important information for the sake of harm, but as a dedication to not rubbing someone else up against the true, hurtful aspects of our nature. It is ultimately no great sign of kindness to insist on showing someone our entire selves at all times. Repression, a certain degree of restraint and a dedication to editing our pronouncements belong to love as much as a capacity for explicit confession. The person who cannot tolerate secrets, who in the name of ‘being honest’ divulges information so wounding it cannot be forgotten, is no friend of love. We should accept an ongoing need to edit our full reality.</p>
