        <h3>2 Progress</h3>
<p>Pre-modern societies envisaged history in cyclical terms: there was no forward dynamic to speak of; one imagined that things would always be as bad or as good as they had ever been. There was no more change in human affairs than there was in the seasons. Empires would wax and wane; periods of plenty would alternate with seasons of dearth, yet the fundamentals would remain. To be modern is to believe that we can continually surpass what has come before: national wealth, knowledge, technology, political arrangements and, most broadly, our capacity for fulfilment, seem capable of constant increase. We’ve severed the chains of repetitive suffering. Time is not a wheel of futility; it is an arrow pointing towards a perfectible future.</p>
