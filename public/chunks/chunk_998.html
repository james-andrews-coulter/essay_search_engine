        <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ONE’S FALLIBLE NATURE</h2>
<p>The idea that one is, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to be around – and hence to be married to – may sound improbable and even offensive. Yet fully understanding and readily and graciously admitting to this possibility might be the surest way of making sure one is an endurable proposition over the long term. There are few people more deeply insufferable than those who don’t, at regular intervals, suspect they might be so.</p>
<p>All of us are hugely tricky propositions. We don’t need to know anyone in particular to know this about everyone. In one way or another, we have all been inadequately parented; we have a panoply of unfortunate psychological traits; we are beset by bad habits; we are anxious, jealous, ill-tempered and vain. We will bring an awesome amount of trouble into someone else’s life by agreeing to be their spouse.</p>
<p>We tend to be shielded from this unwelcome news prior to marriage through a mixture of sentimentality and neglect. Our parents loved us too much to tell us; our friends don’t want to get bogged down in detailed critiques of our personalities; our exes were too keen to escape from us to break down our flaws – they simply said they needed more space, or a long trip to India.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we’re on our own, we don’t notice how annoying we might be in the eyes of others. Perhaps we were sulking for the whole of a Sunday, but no-one was there to be driven crazy by our self-pity and passive fury. We may have tendencies to use our work as an escape from intimacy, but so long as we are not permanently with someone, we can pass off our eccentric hours without comment. Our peculiar eating habits won’t be real until there is another person across the table to register our challenging chewing sounds and shocking ingredient combinations.</p>
<p>Eventually, a partner will call us out on these traits. It feels like a horrible personal attack that a nicer person would not put us through. But it is no such thing. It is an inevitable response to our failings, which anyone would eventually need to bring up.</p>
<p>Our partner is not really doing anything odd; they are merely holding up a mirror. Seen close up, everyone has an appalling amount wrong with their character. It’s not us: it’s the human condition. The specifics vary, of course; people are nightmarish in different ways. But the basic point is shared. Whatever we think or feel about ourselves, we will be revealed as sorely defective upon close-up, prolonged inspection. Sadly, it’s not that our partner is being too critical or unusually demanding. They are the bearer of inevitable news: that we are a nightmare.</p>
<p>This view of human nature can seem shocking, but only because we’re unprepared for it, and therefore tend to assume that it must be a prelude to a constantly fractious relationship. It is nothing of the sort. It is the only reliable basis upon which harmony can be established.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the notion of Original Sin was the starting point for thinking about ourselves as essentially messed up creatures. The idea emerged at the end of the Roman Empire in the West. As the Empire collapsed in anarchic violence, the major thinker of the era, St Augustine, started to look around for an explanation for the miserable condition of society. His key suggestion was that human nature is essentially flawed and misguided. He identified this failing as ‘original’ – that is, as part of the basic inheritance of being born human.</p>
<p>Although Original Sin was developed in theological terms, its implication is really psychological: as individuals we have to accept from the outset that there will be quite a lot wrong with us. This shouldn’t be seen as a shocking, awkward admission, but as a necessary truth that applies to everyone and must be accepted with humility. It shouldn’t be odd to admit our substantial imperfections: on the contrary, it should be ridiculous and suspicious to pretend we might not have any.</p>
<p>Augustine’s point remains valid, even though we don’t now explain it by the story of the original mother of humanity, Eve, eating a forbidden apple in the Garden of Eden. Our failings have natural, and pretty much unavoidable, origins: our wayward impulses, unreasonable stubbornness, tendency to procrastinate; moodiness, rash decisions, flashes of misdirected anger and arrogance; zones of coldness, panicked responses, bad habits, sterile fussiness, greediness and prickly defensiveness (to start the list). We were born vulnerable; we were haphazardly parented; our brains are not well adapted for self-knowledge; our instincts evolved for a life of hunting and gathering rather than for the demands of modernity; and the culture that surrounds us is frequently alarmist, status-driven and very cruel in demanding success yet ensuring that we will almost always feel like failures. So for entirely different reasons we can embrace the same conclusion as St Augustine: no-one has any chance of emerging as an adult without a significant share of serious failings.</p>
<p>The point of all this is to drive home the idea that acknowledging one’s flaws isn’t a request to admit something very strange. What would be strange would be to think that one was without major defects. Of course, we have some delightful qualities as well. But it does mean that we will unavoidably be very hard for another person to live with. Asking someone to marry you can be a rather cruel thing to do to someone you claim to care about.</p>
<p>The point of becoming clear and honest about our failings is to recognise that we will contribute substantially to the difficulties we are bound to encounter in the marriage. It encourages us to resist the otherwise very tempting thesis that we have married an idiot or a brute. It will help us to smile and say sorry when the other person stands in the kitchen shouting at us, as they will, after another display of our foolishness. With a strong sense of our failings in mind, we’ll be more aware of the generosity our partner is displaying in their willingness to take us on.</p>
<p>Ahead of the wedding, therefore, we need to ask ourselves, as candidly as possible, what might be specifically crazy, desperate or undeveloped in ourselves.</p>
<p>Maturity involves having a quite detailed answer to the question: how are you difficult to live with? No one should make vows to another person until they have some proper responses to this primordial enquiry. A presumption of one’s own innocence is at the heart of self-righteousness and cruelty.</p>
<p>Because our minds may go blank at this point and remember only our tender and beautiful sides, we can lean on a set of prompts and attempt to answer them as candidly as we can.</p>
<p>i. When I’m annoyed, I have a tendency to…</p>
<p>It is hard not to lose one’s temper – everyone does it sometimes – but the way we do it might be especially tricky. For instance, we might have a tendency wildly to exaggerate in moments of rage – we know we’re blustering and don’t truly mean what we say (or shout). But we like to make a drama. Or maybe we simmer below the surface and pretend all is well when we desperately want the other to realise (without our having to tell them) that all is very far from fine.</p>
<p>ii. When I feel hurt I…</p>
<p>One’s bruised self-regard can manifest in what, to one’s partner, are hard-to-read ways. Perhaps one withdraws: it looks like cold indifference, but it’s really self-protection. Or one becomes fanatically industrious and demanding or snide or morose or boastful (as a way of trying to counteract a feeling of vulnerability). The other doesn’t know the roots of our behaviour: they are just exposed to the outward performance.</p>
<p>iii. When I’m tired I…</p>
<p>In principle, tiredness is an innocuous problem: nothing is deeply wrong; we just need a good night’s sleep. But the way we behave when tired may seem to tell a different story. Maybe we get snappy or weepy or gloomy or a touch manic. Any of these might worry our partner, who won’t automatically know we’re just exhausted.</p>
<p>iv. My friends could be a problem in so far as…</p>
<p>These are people we’ve known perhaps since long before we met our partner; they may bring out sides of our character that are not to the fore in our relationship or marriage; they may even not much like our partner. But it’s not readily obvious to us that this can be a problem: we like our friends and we like our partner, and, without thinking about it very much, we imagine that we can all get along just fine. Perhaps we can’t.</p>
<p>v. Around money, I can be difficult because…</p>
<p>Money inevitably brings out stranger aspects in us, but they are so familiar to us we might not notice how odd and troubling they could look to someone who shares our economic life. Perhaps we are exceedingly cautious and conservative; a crisis seems always around the corner; we’re terrified of even a small extra expenditure. Maybe (for very deep, intimate reasons) we can’t bear to pay much attention to our finances; or we’re always looking to the next scheme, or we’re extremely hopeful about our future earnings (perhaps with little evidence). Such attitudes feel natural to us but won’t necessarily make sense to someone else who comes to the issue via their own equally unique and obscure path.</p>
<p>vi. I guess I worry a lot about…</p>
<p>We’ve lived for so long with our worries that they feel second nature to us. But to our partner they may be very far from being obvious things to get anxious about. Even after quite a long time together, it might seem strange to them that we become so agitated about a mispronounced word or a routine financial check-up. They don’t know the underlying worries, and what drives our worries, unless we are clear about them in our own heads and are able to explain them with all the calm eloquence we can muster.</p>
<p>vii. I’m unusually obsessed by…</p>
<p>Our own obsessions strike us as hugely reasonable and proper. For instance, we might take the view that it matters immensely that the chairs are arranged symmetrically in a room; it’s obvious that all the kitchen utensils have to match; clearly, we feel, no intelligent person could think you need to use a chopping board just to cut a loaf of bread; we think it’s natural to visit eight art galleries on holiday. We’re typically blind to our own obsessions, because they don’t feel obsessive. They have profound origins in our past and our character, but they aren’t obvious to our partner, who has lived an entirely different life from us up to now. It’s hard but crucial to try to get some perspective on the ways in which we might be bringing a very personal and (to be frank) rather odd set of expectations into our shared life.</p>
<p>viii. I’ve got some routines that I guess can be difficult…</p>
<p>Maybe I have to file my toenails, do several stretching exercises, floss my teeth for three minutes and apply anti-wrinkle cream to my forehead before I can think of getting into bed – though my partner may interpret this as reluctance to join them. Maybe I find it necessary to wash up as much as I can before having dinner, though my partner is eager to eat as soon as the meal is ready. Perhaps over the years I’ve honed a travel routine – least possible baggage, packed while the taxi is waiting, arriving just before check-in closes. We don’t intuitively grasp how off-putting or maddening our own routines might be for a partner; they hardly even strike us as routines, as they just seem natural and right. And that, of course, is where the problem lies: with insufficient attention to our basic strangeness.</p>
<p>The point of prompting greater awareness of our own questionable patterns of behaviour isn’t to feel guilty or ashamed about them, but to see how easily they could be confusing, disturbing and annoying to another person. Before we commit ourselves to marriage, we need to become fully acquainted with all the ways in which we might be a serious challenge to be around.</p>
