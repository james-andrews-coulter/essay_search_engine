        <h4>5. Focussing</h4>
<p>Focus is about saying No.</p>
<p>(STEVE JOBS)</p>
<p>Surely the more options we have, the more chance we have for love. Especially if we blame previous romantic disappointments on a lack of alternatives, then richness and variety
  of choice seem the obvious keys to success. Which is why the first question we may be asking about our love-search is how to find ‘more’ possibilities.</p>
<p>This is a great question if we’re short on options, if our circle of single contacts has dwindled to nil; if we live in a town – or country – where we know no one; if
  we’re not meeting any potential partners either at work or at play. It’s an especially useful enquiry if we are in a majority gender for our life-stage: research suggests that men in
  their twenties have only half as many partner possibilities as women do, but that in the forties the balance begins to reverse. If we can’t find a partner in these situations, the main
  problem is certainly the numbers. We’re a seller in a buyers’ market and the solution is to find more buyers.</p>
<p>The way forward is to steer clear of babbling brooks, avoid stagnant pools and find slow rivers. Stripped of the metaphors, what I mean is this: stay away from gatherings with no chance of
  ‘get-to-know-you’ conversations, or where meeting up again is unlikely. Don’t get trapped in a social life where you see the same people over and over again. Instead, put your
  energy into groups which offer a steady and regular through-flow of different individuals, in situations where there’s opportunity to mingle, meet, chat and bond. That’s a slow river,
  and so long as it contains people with a similar background, outlook, values – it will deliver partner possibilities. Just as importantly, it will also deliver a fulfilled and fascinating
  existence as a base camp from which to embark on the partnership climb.</p>
<p>Finding a slow river</p>
<p>How many slow rivers do you have in your life? If the answer is not many, and getting ‘more’ is your issue, pause now and brainstorm what your rivers could be;
  include as many ideas as possible, without censoring even the maddest thoughts. Start a new hobby? Go to a partnered dance class? Attend dating events? Organize your own dating events? Put a call
  out on Facebook? Put a call out on your local radio station – it worked for Sam Baldwin, aforementioned hero of Sleepless in Seattle. Take off on a three-country tour – it
  worked for Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love.</p>
<p>Plus – if it feels comfortable – sign up to a dating website. Whether we like it or not, online is without question the most accessible slow river currently available – one in
  which the whole agenda is to bond and the entire process ensures a regular through-flow. To enhance the expansion project, join a variety of sites – some paid, some free, some new, some
  established. Once on, be open-minded about possibilities, proactive rather than reactive and as flexible as possible about non-essential parameters. (Though not foolishly flexible. Tick the
  ‘200 miles away’ location box on websites and you’ll very soon face the reality of long-distance relationships and find yourself switching the location specification to
  ‘same town’.)</p>
<p>Stagnant pools. It’s worryingly easy to create a life so pleasant, established and secure that it delivers absolutely zero chance of meeting any suitable partner.</p>
<p>More or less?</p>
<p>Having noted the above strategies, and taken the first steps towards action, forget the advantages of ‘more’ and embrace the benefits of ‘less’. And not
  only because quantity is less crucial than quality in partner choice, but also because the human brain treads a fine line between having a wide range of options and having too many for sanity.</p>
<p>In a famous experiment by Professor Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, customers at a grocery store decided what jam to buy; of those who had a choice of twenty-four jams, only 3 per cent
  ended up purchasing, while of those who had a choice of six jams a full 30 per cent bought. Given we likely don’t use the same criteria to pick a partner as to pick a preserve, let’s
  also mention a less-famous but more relevant survey which gave parallel results. Prospective partners who looked at either four or twenty-four online profiles made more picks than those who looked
  at sixty-four. Significantly, the participants who were presented with only four options took time to consider everyone, while those who were presented with twenty-four or sixty-four options made
  only cursory decisions.</p>
<p>The point here is that too many options plunges us into what’s called ‘shopping mentality’. With a profusion of possibilities, we suffer mental overload. We get confused. Then
  we get anxious about getting confused. And then, to combat the increasing emotional paralysis resulting from that confusion, we try to simplify. Which in turn leads to our over-considering
  irrelevant criteria, rejecting without real consideration, and craving the ‘next good thing’ rather than focussing on the current one. (This last is part of the reason why the constant
  forward momentum of the left/right swipe on some dating apps is so addictive.) Finally, when it comes to online dating in particular, even if we think we’ve found The One, we may still suffer
  buyer’s remorse because the wealth of choice available suggests there’s someone even better out there for us. If you’ve ever been enthusiastically emailed for days then suddenly
  dropped, you were probably the victim not of someone’s rejection but of their shopping mentality.</p>
<p>If only choosing a partner were as simple as walking into a supermarket. On the other hand . . .</p>
<p>What all this means is that any website which trumpets – as one of the global players did very recently – an astounding 197 million members might seem like a magnificent opportunity,
  but may well prove a disaster in disguise. Our real challenge, offline as well as on, is not how to expand possibilities but how to limit them, how to reach an equilibrium where we think clearly
  enough to make good judgement calls.</p>
<p>Elimination</p>
<p>The solution here is, not coincidentally, to take the route that nature intended. Intelligent elimination – the kind of shedding that Steve Jobs refers to in the quote at
  the head of this chapter – is the way evolution means us to mate. Walk into a room full of a hundred possibles – or log on to a website of a million – and we’re doing just
  as our ancestors did thousands of years ago from the vantage point of their caves, unconsciously excluding those who don’t meet our basic criteria (right gender, right age, right tribe).
  Elimination may sound cruel, but it’s the way our instincts are meant to operate in the initial going – not saying ‘yes’ to one but ‘no’ to many, not making a
  single positive choice but first applying wholesale negative screening.</p>
<p>In a society more complex than the Neolithic, some screening’s done before we even begin. Dive into any ‘slow river’ where we feel at home – a study group, a sports
  association, a dance course – and it’s likely the event organizers have already aimed their publicity to eliminate people not in the tribe; we then informally cut the field by choosing
  to attend only certain events and then to mix only with certain people in the room.</p>
<p>Online, the system’s parallel. From the start, some elimination’s already done for us because we enter a world where those not looking for love have already self-excluded; many sites
  also helpfully (though covertly) screen out those with relationship-threatening issues such as drug abuse or long-term mental illness. We further narrow the range ourselves by signing up to sites
  that target our tribe even more specifically; there are now dedicated destinations for specific age groups, individual cities and almost any special interest you can name, along with some you
  can’t even imagine.</p>
<p>Once signed up, the site tick-boxes create further focussing on surface compatibilities such as smoking (or not), drinking (or not), whether we follow sport or how passionately we love Chinese
  food. The algorithmic ‘matching quizzes’, if well done, then disqualify on deeper issues – though of course they can’t predict face-to-face chemistry, and, as mentioned
  earlier, there’s little correlation with long-term compatibility. Happily, the recent introduction of categories for ‘serious’, ‘fling’ or ‘affair’ now
  also achieves the elimination of those wanting a relationship of a kind we’re not seeking, which is a huge relief for all those online daters single and looking for marriage who – up to
  a few years ago – kept bumping into those married and looking for a fling.</p>
<p>The funnel of love</p>
<p>All this pre-sorting is helpful. But the bottom line is that, however small the partner pool we fish in, there’ll come a time when we need to do our own, more individual
  eliminations, partner by partner. My favourite metaphor here is one offered by the late Israeli psychologist Ayala Malach Pines. She imagined a kind of ‘funnel of love’ – her pun,
  not mine – into which we pour everyone we meet. But just as a funnel gets narrower as it deepens, and lets fewer and fewer elements through, so our criteria naturally get more and more
  focussed as we eliminate potential partners, until we eventually accept only the ones who really suit. (The criteria we use to create and operate our funnel form the substance of the following
  chapters of this book.)</p>
<p>What often stops us from using the love funnel effectively is a kind of fear of focussing: a nervousness about elimination, a wariness of being choosy, a belief that we shouldn’t –
  for which read ‘aren’t entitled to’ – dismiss partners who mismatch, or partnership options which don’t appeal. ‘I need to spread the net wide or I won’t
  find anyone’. . . ‘If I set the bar too high no one will want me’. . . ‘I can’t say no to her/him, they’ll feel so rejected’. This panic is totally
  understandable if we’ve had – as we all have – past heartbreak. But it’s nevertheless misguided; we do need to focus on what we want rather than going with the flow.
  I’m not a believer in ‘The One’, but unless we start saying no to those who aren’t right for us, we won’t get anywhere near those who are.</p>
<p>If you suspect that fear of focussing is holding you back, then try this. Imagine yourself sitting somewhere you feel most comfortable, and knowing that your ‘right for you’ partner
  is nearby. You’re happy because he or she is there, you know that they care for you and you for them and you allow yourself to want them and to want the relationship you have with them. (If
  you’re tempted into caveats or qualifications of the ‘nobody loves me’ or ‘that’ll never happen’ kind, set these aside for the moment.) Now imagine your partner
  arrives. Imagine seeing them, hearing their voice as they speak to you, feeling their touch as they reach out for you. Allow yourself to experience their attention fully and know that you deserve
  that attention.</p>
<p>The point of this exercise is not to imagine what a future partner might actually be like. It’s to have a mental experience of wanting that partner, feeling entitled to want them and being
  wanted in return. As explained at the very start of this book, partner choice is a quest, and as with all quests it’s good to have a bit of feisty courage – courage to believe in
  yourself, courage to believe there are partners out there you can choose, courage to believe that there are partners out there who will choose you. Given that belief, you’ll find it much
  easier to keep setting aside those you don’t want and keep heading towards those you do.</p>
<p>Specifying</p>
<p>So how do we begin? How do we create our personal love funnel? The answer is to get more specific. Specificity clears the mind, orders the thinking, makes us feel in control,
  helps us understand what we’re doing. We are right to believe that specifying will help us towards a result, even in an area as unpredictable as partner choice.</p>
<p>The historical wheel has come full circle here. When marriage decisions were made on measurable criteria – age, status, earnings, childbearing potential – specifying was the way to
  narrow the field. But when romance left its place in the wings and took centre stage, we sniffed at being too precise, because we wanted to let our emotions rule – if we loved each other,
  surely the details were irrelevant. Now things are coming back into balance. Much of the current coverage of partner choice presents its lessons in the form of specified lists – as seen on
  every online dating site, in many relationship-advice articles, and via the relationships section on Amazon. The current crop of urban tales featuring heroes/heroines who found their
  princess/prince through detailed specification inspire us not only because we too want to magically conjure up our own fairy-tale partners, but also because we recognize that specifying is
  necessary to the process.</p>
<p>Of course we shouldn’t over-specify. It’s not only that, life being what it is, we can’t have everything we want. It’s also that many of the details of what we want will
  be irrelevant to our goal of a good relationship. It may matter hugely that a partner shares our love of animals, but if they do love animals – or if we fall for them regardless – it
  likely won’t matter at all that they have blue eyes rather than brown. Proof of this is courtesy of another study by Professor Eli Finkel, in which he asked speed daters their partner
  criteria just before the event; said daters then completely ignored their own benchmarks when they started mingling only minutes later. However convinced we are that we need a partner who’s
  extravert/introvert, dark/blonde, big/small, if we find the right person, size won’t matter.</p>
<p>Even so, once our partner pool is big enough, specifying is the perfect starting point. It keeps us on logical track. It boundaries the challenge and keeps it doable. It engages our minds for a
  task which can otherwise all too easily become over-influenced by our hearts and other more lustful parts of our anatomy. Perhaps unexpectedly, specifying also opens the door to deeper
  realizations. Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, whose bestselling book Thinking, Fast and Slow recently alerted us to the subtleties of decision-making – or in other words, choice
  – points out that specifying doesn’t just call on logic but also on a more instinctive awareness. He believes that we ‘improve . . . intuition by making a list then sleeping on
  it.’ When we create a partner specification, we will often mysteriously find ourselves exploring much wider issues, not just about surface criteria but also about what we need from a partner
  on a deeper level, and how to instinctively recognize that when it arrives.</p>
<p>Your wish-list</p>
<p>Specifying is the perfect starting point – and the right first step. Our assumption, offline as well as on, is that we should start with what we ourselves are
  ‘selling’ and only then consider what we want to ‘buy’ from a partner. But that’s not only the wrong metaphor – partnership is not about trading but about
  relating – it’s also the wrong way round. To attract someone, we first need to know what kind of someone to attract. We can’t set the GPS effectively until we know the
  destination.</p>
<p>If you’ve already made a wish-list of the specifics you want in a partner, take this opportunity to revisit it. If you haven’t already made a list, here’s your opportunity.
  Write down all the elements which for you headline your ideal mate. Gender, age, appearance, cultural background, religious belief, lifestyle, career, earnings, leisure patterns, hobbies,
  interests, location – if you run out of categories, most online dating sites include an extensive tick-box list. Avoid vague, avoid abstract – the idea is to get a detailed, defined,
  quantifiable starter guide. Then prioritize in order of importance; as I’ve said, you can’t have everything, so your top five at least need to be the things you couldn’t live
  without.</p>
<p>Deal-breakers</p>
<p>Next, list the things you couldn’t live with, your deal-breakers. This part of the process aims to make sure we don’t find ourselves involved with (worse,
  married to) someone utterly unsuitable; it’s the bottom line which helps us less to find The One – for there are many Ones – as to make sure that The Totally Wrong One
  doesn’t slip under our guard because they are tempting. Here are four classic deal-breakers, and that’s about the number to aim for – more, and you’re probably drawing the
  net too tight.</p>
<p>•   Different and uncomplimentary sexual leanings – such as a potential partner’s being gay whereas you need straight, or vice versa</p>
<p>•   Mismatched relationship aims – such as their wanting marriage where you want casual, or vice versa</p>
<p>•   A conflict in deep values – such as their being highly religious whereas you are allergic to anything remotely spiritual</p>
<p>•   Incompatibility of interests – not a gap in enthusiasm, which can often be bridged by encouragement, but a serious mismatch, such as their
          being a passionate sailor whereas you are aquaphobic</p>
<p>It’s tempting not to consider deal-breakers. But we should be clear about what we don’t want, especially the elements we are uneasy about not wanting, as
  they’re the ones we may most unwisely give ground on. If we truly couldn’t live with someone who has a dangerous job, for example, it’s fairer to everyone to be aware of that,
  rather than denying, compromising, then wobbling.</p>
<p>A ‘normal, happy day’</p>
<p>Wish-list made, deal-breakers noted, we next need to specify in a slightly different way. Rather than defining a partner, envision a partnership. What if you woke up one weekday
  morning five years in the future, having made the perfect choice. Imagine the rest of the day – not special, not peak experience, just normal, solid and satisfying. What might be your plan
  for this ‘normal, happy day’? In what location would you see yourself? What would you do? How would you spend time – with your partner? By yourself? Who else might be there? What
  sort of lifestyle would you have? How would you feel? Above all, what would be especially rewarding about the relationship you’d created?</p>
<p>This exercise gives new perspective by drawing two crucial distinctions – between dream and actuality and between partner and partnership. Envisioning what we’re after not as fantasy
  but as reality strips away many of the inessentials – things we may hanker after but are irrelevant to our happiness; we may find ourselves altering our wish-lists as a result. Plus the
  exercise broadens awareness out again, from the partner we might choose to the everyday life we would have with that partner. (This everyday life is, of course, the whole aim of choosing a partner
  in the first place: I did at one point wonder whether this book should have been called ‘How to Choose a Partnership’.) Enhancing detail in this way leaves in place the core needs, but
  allows us to form a resonant and motivating picture of what we want our future to hold.</p>
<p>Welcoming invitation</p>
<p>How to use these specifications? When doing distance dating, the wish-list and the deal-breakers inform the tick-boxes, while the ‘normal, happy day’ exercise will
  give you the material to write the free-text elements of profile and partner specification. There’s an added bonus here. Research suggests that, online, it’s more compelling – for
  which read attractive – to structure your profile not as a ‘dating CV’ (age, interests, holiday plans) but as a welcoming invitation to join you in a relationship; the
  ‘normal, happy day’ exercise provides all the essential raw material for such an invitation.</p>
<p>If you’re motivated to put in the work, you could also use the material you’ve gathered to design and apply your own customized matching algorithm. This is precisely what was done by
  PhD student Chris McKinlay, who apparently had something of a eureka moment when he realized that, rather than relying entirely on personal charisma, he could use his talent as a mathematician to
  develop a personal formula for a perfect partner. He did so, found love and wrote the bestselling book to prove it. Details of Optimal Cupid – and of Data, a Love Story,
  from female counterpart Amy Webb – are in the bibliography.</p>
<p>If partner choice is face-to-face – speed dating, blind dating, meeting with an online suitor or simple right-place-right-time serendipity – the wish-list, deal-breakers and
  ‘normal, happy day’ specifications are vital touchstones. With these kept firmly in mind, we can begin to tally vision with reality, our desires with flesh and blood, and start asking
  ourselves the crucial questions: Does this person fit our theoretical specification and, if not, does that matter? We may well feel it doesn’t, if in other ways there is a fit. Does this
  person contravene any of our deal-breakers, and if so, is that contravention writ in stone? It may well be resolvable with some negotiation. Finally, but most importantly, could this person help us
  create the daily life that we want for ever? If there’s a real possibility they can, that’s the best basis for continuing.</p>
