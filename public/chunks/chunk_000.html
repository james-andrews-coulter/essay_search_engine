        <h3>1. It’s meant to be easy, but it isn’t</h3>
<p>We are surrounded by reminders that friendship is central to a full and properly lived life: an advert shows us a charming group of people delighting in each other’s company at a beach barbecue; a figure we admire states in an interview that the most important thing in their life is, quite simply, their group of friends; on a Monday morning, a pleasant colleague mentions the great weekend they had with a friend they have adored for two decades who is visiting from overseas; a fascinating article delves into creative friendships between artists … It all adds up to a beguiling evocation of intimacy and warmth. In a world where conflict and selfishness so often dominate, friendship is held up as the great universally available consolation. It’s a charming, moving vision of the purpose of existence. And it is also, too often, when we can bear to explore the idea, a quietly distressing and tortuous mirage.</p>
<p>Our own experience of friendship tends – privately and shamefully – to fall so far short of the ideal. Loneliness continues to hound us; we struggle to communicate at depth with others; we return home from parties dissatisfied and confused. We tell others that we adore them while seldom actually managing to feel more than a tepid alliance. Friendship, which clearly seems very real for others, can somehow appear not entirely available to us. We find ourselves facing questions in the privacy of our own minds that, asked by an adult, can sound painfully naive, even humiliating: how do you make a true friend? What do friends do together? Why can’t I find the friends I want? And we may end up, in the middle of the night, circling a grim existential enquiry: do I actually have any real friends?</p>
<p>There is no need to make an already painful situation worse. We should draw consolation from a seldom-mentioned but indubitable reality: friendship is neither easy nor natural. It definitely isn’t inevitable. Some of the most sensitive and intelligent people who have ever lived have lacked friends. Many of those who appear highly social in fact harbour profound feelings of communal inadequacy. A lack of friendship usually has very little to do with a deficiency of social skills. The lonely are seldom the peculiar outcasts of popular imagination. Loneliness can coexist alongside an outwardly highly cheerful and easy manner and even – paradoxically – alongside the possession of many so-called ‘friends’. We can be lonely and regularly invited to parties. We can be lonely and receive a lot of messages on our birthdays. We can be lonely and feted as highly social. The lonely may hold their own brilliantly at a party; they might be married, have children and more often than not be out in the evenings. They are not the kind of people who are supposed to be lonely or indeed look bereft and forlorn. And yet they (we) are.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the word ‘friend’ is ambiguous. It points – in ordinary usage – to a pretty nice social companion, someone to share a laugh with and perhaps see once a month or so. But it also speaks to something much more tender, fundamental and emotionally sustaining: a sense that in the company of a very special person, we will at last be able to share the most vulnerable and fragile sides of ourselves and be witnessed in our true, unadorned state; we’ll have the privilege of throwing off lies and deceit and be able to say what we really believe, in all its strangeness and riskiness. Another will be able to read us deeply and accurately and will be moved to compassion by our less impressive sides – and to curiosity by our quirks and passions; what is important in us will meet with what is important in them. In a grander conception of the term, friendship may be as significant and as rare as love.</p>
<p>This suggests that it may not be any kind of failing that is responsible for our lack of friendships, but rather an uncommon degree of ambition. We are lonely not because we can’t find anyone to spend an evening with, but because we have an unusually expansive and grand idea of what friendship should be about. We are lonely because we are refusing to accept as genuine those cheap, counterfeit images of friendship promoted by a sentimental world keen to disguise the challenges of real connection. Those who feel a lack of friendship most deeply may simply be those who cleave most intensely and sincerely to its genuine promises.</p>
<p>When trying to imagine what true friendship might look like, it can pay to explore some of the less familiar byways of culture and history. For example, for a period in early 19th-century Europe, a particularly elevated conception of friendship came to the fore. For a time, friendship was viewed as if it might be an equal to the summits of romantic love. A person might want to die for a friend or justify their life by one.</p>
<p>In the 1820s, the German artist Caspar David Friedrich painted two men seen from behind, standing alone together on a wooded hill late at night; one lays his arm comfortably on the other’s shoulder. It’s clearly an intimate scene. What are they doing? Are they plotting a revolution or the robbery of a local manor house? Is the oﬃcial title – Two Men Contemplating the Moon – just cultural cover for the portrayal of a clandestine erotic liaison?</p>
<p>Caspar David Friedrich, Two Men Contemplating the Moon, c. 1825–1830</p>
<p>In fact, Friedrich was commemorating in art an especially intense, kind, sustaining friendship he’d had with a fellow painter, August Heinrich, who had died – at the age of only 25 – from a lung disease a few years before. He and Heinrich had discussed their craft for many hours; they had sung songs, read each other poetry, shared their dissatisfactions with society and pledged to support and care for one another for life. They had also often gone out and looked at the moon together and bonded over its solemn majesty.</p>
<p>This starts to hint to us what a true friendship might involve. With a real friend, we might reveal our excitements at small, unheralded but deeply significant things (it could be a love of the night sky, or of a certain kind of music, craft beer or needlework). With a real friend, we might feel as uninhibited as a child around a loving parent. Our souls might thrum in harmony. We might lay a hand or arm on theirs (without anything sensual being meant thereby). We might want to see them all the time – and even decide to live with them permanently. We might want to share every movement, large or small, of our minds.</p>
<p>We are – here – very far from the idea of friendship as a form of casual bonhomie. Something close to romantic is at stake, and yet it is happening independently of sex. It’s a love not of the body but of the mind and spirit.</p>
<p>Oddly, this vision of friendship can seem to be an affront to social convention. Friendship is often represented as a form of collective chumminess: a group of people horsing around, being part of a fashionable crowd. To love the company of one or two people can appear to demote the gang. Real friends can cast a slightly humiliating shadow on what typically, but inadequately, passes for friendship. A culture that wants to promote the notion of having dozens of friends can’t engage with a longing to exit a wide circle and be alone to do something serious and purposeful with just a few special others.</p>
<p>The best friendships are typically thought of as a matter of luck: one just happens to meet and click with the perfect friend. The classic point of reference for this comes in an essay by the 16th-century French philosopher Montaigne. In his 20s Montaigne met – quite by chance at a large party – a young lawyer by the name of Étienne de La Boétie. They immediately became ‘extraordinary’ friends and this lasted, unchanged, until de La Boétie’s miserably early death a decade later. ‘Why were we such good friends?’ Montaigne asked himself in a famous essay on friendship. ‘Because it was him, because it was me’ was his unforgettable, tender response. But it is also a very unhelpful answer, for it announces, with intellectual elegance, a passive mystic stance. Do you want a great friend? – Montaigne seems to be asking. Then wait and hope. There’s nothing to be done except, perhaps, cross one’s fingers.</p>
<p>Our enquiry is more hopeful. We want to replace mystery with logic. True friendship is a skill, not a piece of divine inspiration. Those who find it are not simply lucky: they understand certain crucial ideas; they are guided by specific insights into themselves and other people. And these ideas and insights can be explained and described in precise ways. We don’t have to be born with innate talents for being, or making, a good friend; the capacities can be acquired via the right kind of education. Around friendship we are still, collectively, at the beginning of the kind of frank and constructive conversations we require. Our culture has long evoked the joys of having friends; we now need to talk with greater determination and vulnerability about the delicate and subtle art of making them.</p>
