            <h2>THE EXTREME LOYALTY OF CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS</h2>
<p>We hear a lot about ungrateful children: offspring who lack respect and deference, who don’t appreciate how much was done for them, who complain without reason and lament with unfair bitterness.</p>
<p>But what is often missed is how deeply children are, for the most part, loyal to their parents. They will go to enormous lengths to try to think well of those who brought them into the world, isolating things that are good in them and focusing on these wholeheartedly at the expense of memorizing what was mean-spirited or painful.</p>
<p>As psychotherapists have long observed, the worse the childhood, the greater and more manic the filial loyalty tends to be. There are no more tenacious defenders of their parents’ legacies and reputations than those who were maligned, ignored, or physically harmed. In a choice between thinking that we might be bad ourselves or accepting that a parent was the disappointing and cruel one, self-hatred tends to win most of the time. It is, in the end, less devastating to deem ourselves ungrateful and awful than to imagine that we were brought up by small-minded mediocrities who were too ill or troubled to care.</p>
<p>ARE WE MODERNS UNIQUELY SELF-OBSESSED?</p>
<p>To compound our sense of irritation at needing to look at our childhoods, we may have a nagging sense that doing so is a uniquely modern luxury. It can seem like evidence of a particularly regrettable kind of decadence and weakness that we should be spending so much time thinking of “Mommy” or “Daddy” while outside bigger and more important issues await us. We may enviously suspect that earlier, less cosseted and more martial ages had no time for any such nonsense. They were too busy surviving to indulge themselves in idle, circuitous thoughts about their ancestors and progenitors.</p>
<p>But we should be wary on this score. People in other ages may not have had the language of Freud; they didn’t know about projection, the superego, or repression. And yet they thought a lot about mommies and daddies nonetheless—and worried intensely about the impact they had on their lives. Even while they were spearing enemies, tracking deer, or setting off in longboats, they were never far from extraordinary absorption in their own families’ stories. They simply framed their interests in different terms.</p>
<p>In any premodern culture we might study, we can identify an obsession with the well-being and management of “ancestors.” Every illness, perturbation of the mind, obsession, incapacity, or sorrow will immediately be ascribed to the work of the spirit of a dead family member; it is always about the past. And every society therefore learns to manage these figures from yesteryear with extreme care, with an understanding that an ancestor who has not been properly processed and put to rest will end up taking bitter revenge on us: we might become impotent or grow depressed, marry the wrong person, or fail in our careers.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, during the annual fifteen-day festival of Pchum Ben, the whole society turns its attention to its ancestors, stretching back as many as seven generations, and makes extensive and costly food offerings in their names, as well as going to temples to carry out rituals and to chant songs for them. It’s understood that the gates of hell have been opened at this time and any ancestor with a difficult character may be on the loose, looking to cause trouble, unless they are appeased by the strenuous efforts of the living.</p>

<p>We may not go about matters in exactly this way—we may head for the couch rather than the temple. But the underlying dynamics are strikingly similar. We are in essence always striving to ensure that figures from our pasts are not allowed to ruin what remains of our lives.</p>
<p>4 Love</p>
<p>The main ingredient on which any recovery from serious mental illness depends is also one which, curiously and grievously, never makes an appearance in any medical handbook or psychiatric diagnostic, namely love. The word is so fatefully associated with romance and sentimentality that we overlook its critical role in helping us to keep faith with life at times of overwhelming psychological confusion and sorrow. Love—whether from a friend, a partner, an offspring, or a parent—has an indomitable power to rescue us from mental illness.</p>
<p>We might go so far as to say that anyone who has ever suffered from mental illness and who recovers will do so—whether they consciously realize it or not—because of an experience of love. And, by extension, no one has ever fallen gravely mentally ill without, somewhere along the line, having suffered from a severe deficit of love. Love turns out to be the guiding strand running through the onset of, and recovery from, our worst episodes of unwellness.</p>
<p>What, then, do we mean by love, in its life-giving, mind-healing sense?</p>
