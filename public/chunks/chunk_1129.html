        <h2>San Juan River</h2>
<p>One of our greatest difficulties which gives us problems in so many areas is that we can’t understand time. However often the facts are explained to us, they keep slipping from our minds. Our myopia is partly rooted in our lifespan: the eighty or so years we have on the planet tend to power a steadfast background sense of what a ‘long time’ might mean. Our brains dwell predominantly in the here and now, for there seems no efficiency or reward in having too many thoughts about what used to be or what is to come. Three months from now already feels very remote; a decade before our birth has a primaeval sheen to it; five years away is unimaginable.
These biases are understandable, but they make things far harder than necessary. We continuously exaggerate both the importance of setbacks in our individual lives and, more broadly, the significance of these lives within the greater span of planetary existence. As a result, we panic far more than we should and we laugh far less than we might. An animal that thinks of a five-hour journey as ‘long’ or a threeminute download time as ‘slow’ is going to have problems finding perspective around a great many of its travails.
The sharp bends in the San Juan River in southeastern Utah appear to know our problem well enough and offer us a powerful solution to it. We cannot spend more than a moment in their company without sensing that we are being told something very powerful about time; more specifically, how much of it there has been and how little of that has been about us, the current president, the shocking headlines Gnd the mesmerising scandal. The San Juan River has very slowly cut a winding 300-metredeep canyon through 300 million years of time. The rocks at the river bottom date back to the Palaeozoic period, some 70 million years before the dinosaurs. The Earth’s continents
were at that point fused together into the giant landmass‘of Pangaea, the apex predator was the Dimetrodon, the land was populated by synapsids and diapsids and the seas were filled with molluscs, echinoderms and brachiopods. The air buzzed with dragonflies the size of eagles.
We forget most of what we’ve ever been taught about time, but it pays to keep a few basic facts in mind:
Age of the Earth: 4.543 billion years
First life on Earth: 3.77 billion years ago
First land animal: 428 million years ago
First dinosaurs: 243 million years ago
First Homo sapiens: 200,000 years ago
Birth of agriculture: 10,000 years ago
Early dynastic period in Egypt: 5,000 years ago
Height of the Roman Empire: 1,920 years ago
First photograph: 195 years ago (at the time of writing)
First powered flight: 118 years ago
Last moment of despair: 5 days ago
Even as we scan the list, our attention may blur: a few million here or billion there are hard concepts to fix in the understanding. The San Juan River appreciates the difficulty and won’t set us any tests. It is content, through its majestic beauty, to make an overall point that should reach us through our senses as much as it does through our understanding. It really only wants to say one very simple thing to us nonexperts in its ancient gravelly voice: that it is very, very old, and that we are very, very short-lived. And on that basis alone, we should probably surrender our absurd and painful sense of the seriousness and importance of all that we are and do.</p>
