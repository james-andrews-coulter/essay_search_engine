        <h3>¶ Misemployment</h3>
<p>Employment refers to the state of being generically in work. Misemployment refers to the state of being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any sincerity the higher needs of others, merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead.</p>
<p>The ranks of the misemployed are populated by workers who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits, and tempting but highly sugared drinks.</p>
<p>The rate of Misemployment in the economy is never formally measured, but it might be very high. In the Utopia, government would track not just how many people had a job, but how many had a job that catered to higher needs. Economists have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy is the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment is to ‘stimulate demand’. Although technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and Misemployment.</p>
<p>There are real solutions to bringing down the rate of Misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se but to stimulate good demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</p>
<p>In a nation properly concerned with Misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. Twenty per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another thirty per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul.</p>
<p>To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the importance of what is truly valuable and walk past what betrays their potential.</p>
<p>Employment figures are far from irrelevant; they matter a great deal. They are the first things that need to be attended to. All the same, the raw figures mask a more ambitious goal: that of learning to deploy human capital in a properly admirable way.</p>
