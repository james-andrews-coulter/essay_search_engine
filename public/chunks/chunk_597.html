        <h3>¶ FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)</h3>
<p>FOMO is the strong sense that life is elsewhere, leading to restlessness with one’s condition and a sense of ingratitude towards everything one is and has.</p>
<p>The catalysts of FOMO are everywhere. We are continually bombarded with suggestions about what we might do (go jet skiing, study in Colorado, visit the Maldives or see the Pyramids) or where the really extraordinary parties, cities and jobs might be. The modern world makes sure we know at all times just how much we’re missing. It is a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO are almost inevitable.</p>
<p>There are, fundamentally, two ways in which the brute facts of missing out can be viewed: one can take a Romantic or a Classical approach.</p>
<p>To the Romantic temperament, missing out causes agony. Somewhere else, noble, interesting and attractive people are living exactly the life that should be ours. We would be so happy if only we could be over there, at that party, with those people, or working in that agency off Washington Square, or holidaying in that shack in Jutland. Sometimes it may make us want to burst into tears.</p>
<p>The Romantic believes in the idea of a defined centre where the most exciting things are happening. At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin, then London. Now, it’s probably San Francisco; in five years it may be Auckland or Rio.</p>
<p>For the Romantic, humanity is divided into a large group of the mediocre and a tribe of the elect: artists, entrepreneurs, the edgy part of the fashion world and the people doing creative things with tech. As a Romantic, it can be exhausting inside our soul. Our mother sometimes drives us to fury: her life is utterly dull. How can she accept it? Why isn’t she itching to move to the Bay area? She’s always suggesting we take a job in Birmingham or inviting us on walking holidays in the Lake District. Sometimes we are quite rude to her. We avoid certain people like the plague: the shy friend from school who struggles with their weight; the flatmate who is a telecoms engineer and wants to go into local politics. Being around individuals who are so unglamorous and lacking in ambition can feel fatal.</p>
<p>For their part, Classically minded people acknowledge that there are, of course, some genuinely marvellous things going on in the world, but they doubt that the obvious signs of glamour are a good guide to finding them. The best novel in the world, they like to think, is probably not currently winning prizes or storming up the bestseller lists. It may be being written at this moment by an arthritic woman living in the otherwise unremarkable Latvian town of Liep ja.</p>
<p>Classical people are intensely aware that good qualities coexist with some extremely ordinary ones. Everything is jumbled up. Lamentable taste in jumpers is compatible with extraordinary insight. Academic qualifications can give no indication of true intelligence. Famous people can be dull. Obscure ones can be remarkable. At a perfect launch party, drinking sandalwood cocktails at the coolest bar in the world, one could feel sad and anxious. One might have the deepest conversations of one’s life with an aunt – even though she likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dyeing her hair.</p>
<p>The Classical temperament also fears missing out, but has a rather different list of things they are afraid of not enjoying: getting to truly know one’s parents; learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; discovering what their favourite pieces of music really mean to them; chatting to a seven-year-old child … As these wise souls know, one can indeed miss out on some extremely important things if one is always rushing to find excitement elsewhere.</p>
