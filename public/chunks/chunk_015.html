        <h3>1. An absence of shared challenges</h3>
<p>We tend not to pay much attention to the striking fact that most of our friends are acquired at very particular stages of our lives – for example, at secondary school and university, or on long, physically demanding trips, or during our early years in a new company, or after having just had children.</p>
<p>What these diverse situations have in common is eventfulness. Friendships develop when things are intense, involving peril, beauty, jeopardy, drama and self-development. We cement friendships when we have to confront the same sadistic teacher who sets us too much homework; when we have to spend all night in the library cramming for an exam that threatens to determine our whole futures; when we need to negotiate a hot and chaotic bus station at the foot of the Andes; when we have to struggle together to make sense of a mysterious oﬃce hierarchy or need to figure out how to feed a newborn.</p>
<p>It’s not inherently strange that friendships should spring up under such conditions: these are today’s equivalent of primordial tasks like building shelters, hunting animals and grinding corn together. What’s remarkable in the modern world is how we have forgotten the importance of activity in trying to generate friendships.</p>
<p>For example, the favoured locale for the nurturing of new friendships tends to be a bar or a restaurant, where we can be guaranteed to face no greater shared tasks than sipping a beer or asking for a bill. What has, in all likelihood, preceded a challenge-free Saturday evening encounter is a rush to get as much done as possible so as to clear time, as we see it, for the higher business of a quiet chat.</p>
<p>We’ve probably strenuously got all the real work out of the way in the preceding hours from a sense that we would otherwise have irreparably damaged our chances of fostering mutual sympathy. We might have spent a whole afternoon doing the laundry, being perplexed by the instructions for a flat-pack bookcase, rushing around the supermarket or dropping in on our much-loved but rather diﬃcult mother. We might then talk about our hurdles later in the restaurant, but it rarely occurs to us to actually share these hurdles with our companions in real time.</p>
<p>And yet, if we were properly attuned to the preconditions of friendship, we might decide to invite our friends to meet us in the supermarket and take them on a pressured gallop down our shopping list. We would task them with helping us to find the dishwasher tablets and the paper towels; and they’d reveal to us how they balanced their weekly budget and what kind of chocolate biscuits or pretzels they were drawn to. If things were going really well, we might take them home and bond over the laundry. It can be hard to claim to know anyone before we’ve gone through a wash together. However interesting it can be to discuss an acclaimed new film, it may be a lot more meaningful to go through a pile of freshly tumble-dried smalls. And though it can be revealing to discuss how impossible our parents are with a friend over dinner, it is a great deal more effective to take our friend to meet this mother so that they can witness her fascinating blend of tenderness and hostility in action.</p>
<p>We’ve got things backwards. We struggle alone with the real but important business of our lives and then carve out a few deeply unrepresentative placid moments in which to survey recent events. In a wiser society, we’d set out deliberately to involve our friends in our challenges and labours. We’d create opportunities to see each other flustered, laughably frustrated or surprisingly resourceful in adversity. We would bond over small, shared wars against shopping trollies, Allen keys, wrinkled shirts and awkward family meetings. We don’t need to stop talking to friends, but – if we really want to grow close – we might need, far more than we realise, also to begin urgently doing something with them, perhaps starting with the laundry.</p>
<ol>
<li>Presumptions of normality</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the great hurdles to developing deeper friendships is the assumption that, in order to prove acceptable to other people, we need – first and foremost – to come across as extremely normal.</p>
<p>It’s on this basis that we devote an uncommon amount of energy to hiding away all the sides of ourselves that we feel sure would horrify and revolt other people: our hesitations, our sexual quirks, our self-doubts, our neuroses and our moments of panic and despair.</p>
<p>We live in a world that continues to imply that reasonable people might exist. Even as, at an intimate level, no one has ever yet met such creatures.</p>
<p>To acquire friends, we have to make our peace with a perhaps remarkable-sounding idea: that it is normal – and even very sensible – to find life unbearable. We have crises not because we are strangely incapable of living, but because we are – all of us – inevitably at points overwhelmed by the plain unreasonableness, cruelty, senselessness and arduousness of existence.</p>
<p>Real friendship is not so much threatened by disclosures of vulnerabilities and compulsions as built out of them. It is impossible to become a close friend to anyone until we have dared to induct them into our less-than-impressive aspects; until we have been brave enough to display the full scale of our waywardness and our idiocies. We may awe strangers with our strength, but it is only once we dare to present them with our frailties that we are in any position to turn them into sincere allies.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century Romantic culture had a lot of time for emotional eccentricity. There was a recognition that ‘genius’ could at times be aligned with outbreaks of what was plainly referred to as ‘madness’. Talented scientists, poets, artists or philosophers were more or less expected to lapse into the odd demented moment: they might run weeping out of meetings, try to maim themselves, mess up their finances, rant or refuse to get out of bed for a month. But no one panicked because it was understood that certain very good things about these people – their extraordinary sensitivity, authenticity, creativity and insight – would also naturally throw up some more socially uncommon periods.</p>
<p>The error of the analysis was only that it was too narrow. It’s not in truth only scientific or artistic paragons who should be given leeway to go off the rails. We are all of us entitled to sympathetic interpretations of those less conventional instances when we are driven to distraction by a frenzied world and the momentous contradictions in our own natures.</p>

<p>Everyone is inwardly distressed. Most of us keep our potential madness at bay, but we are perfectly well aware that it is there. We should not be scared off by our own turbulence or mistakenly assume that no one could like us if – with a few precautions – one day we revealed our multifaceted reality. We should not continue to lock ourselves into our loneliness from a ruinous belief that no one could witness us and keep faith with us.</p>
<p>By making peace with our true selves, we will also be doing others a great favour; we will simultaneously be encouraging them to befriend their own exiled parts. A friend – in the highest sense – is a select person who is alive to, and has been allowed to see, the collapse of another’s respectable facade. If we never allow this to happen, if we are immensely careful never to be exposed at our worst, we can acquire a reputation as a solid-seeming person and even be celebrated as a grand and impressive one. But we will also – paradoxically and painfully – be closing the door on one of life’s most nourishing and sustaining gifts: a sense that we have been fully seen by someone and, blessedly, remain liked.</p>
