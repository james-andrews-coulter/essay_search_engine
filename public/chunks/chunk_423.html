        <h3>Our name</h3>
<p>Starting from when we are very little, our name tends to be powerfully associated in our own minds with the seat of our true identity. Though it was only chosen by our parents – perhaps after a slightly haphazard process of deliberation – to us, as children, it can seem as if a divine force or some sagacious higher authority picked it out; as though there must be a necessary and indelible connection between who we are and what we are called. As we learn to write our name at nursery school, carefully shaping the letters in a selection of different coloured pens, we build up a connection between our name and our essential self, as symbolised by such elements as our toes, our sense of humour, the way we blink in the sun and our memories of our first seaside holiday. This will be the name that our first lovers will use, that our friends will tweak when they tease us affectionately, that we will write down on application forms for jobs and mortgages … The idea of changing this name, intentionally, in the wake of a disaster, can therefore sound as odd as attempting to alter the animal species we belong to.</p>
<p>What’s more, the sort of people who usually change their names do so in circumstances we would hesitate to identify with: major criminals, ex-Nazis, runaway felons … Their motives for changing their names seem to be connected with outright deception and crookedness. Are we really to join the ranks of the sinister name-changers?</p>
<p>But before we reject the proposal definitively, we might take a moment to think about the psychology of lying. There are situations in which the act of lying should not be counted as an automatic offence. We are sometimes justified in offering a so-called white lie when the truth is at risk of being unhelpfully and gravely distorted by prevailing rigid or categorical ideas. We may lie to preserve the vital truth, through a minor act of fabrication or omission. For example, if a favourite aunt asks us if we like the cake she has baked for us, we might tell her that it’s delicious, not because it is, but because the unvarnished facts about the cake would set off such an avalanche of doubts in our relative’s mind that it would take the relationship further from the truth than a small deception about icing and moisture. Alternatively, we might decide to hide our religion from a new acquaintance for a while because we know that the revelation of our faith would at once close down a dialogue that is of value to us both; one day we will get around to mentioning the truth, but we need to wait for the reality of our character and the sincerity of our intentions to get across before endangering these via a small, yet sadly unavoidably explosive, fact. Sometimes, the preservation of a larger truth requires us to walk through the gate of a minor lie.</p>
<p>By analogy, our failure can mean that our name immediately triggers a response in other people that is genuinely unwarranted and substantially untrue to who we actually are. The name might make them think that we are about to steal their partner (because we were once involved in an adulterous scandal), or that we may try to make off with their wallet or their car keys (because we were once caught up in a tax fraud at a company we worked at twenty years before). The mention of our name will mean that our reality is at once lost and replaced by a one-dimensional caricature. We won’t have a chance to share anything of what we are actually like; our new acquaintance will have fled before getting to know us was even an option. In such circumstances, we might well wonder whether it would be a good idea to change our name, so as to give us more of an opportunity for a fair hearing. Of course, in time – if an interaction deepens – we can fill people in on our life story, but only once they are in a better position to see us in a rounded way.</p>
<p>In many a fairy tale, a royal – burdened by the weight of expectation attached to their name – will pretend to be a commoner, not in order to manipulate, but in order to achieve a more sincere connection with others that would be impossible if their impactful title were known from the start. The royal lies in order to be more truthfully known. Our own name change will in effect be like a grimmer version of the same phenomenon. We, too, will hide who we are, not to mock or taunt, but to attempt to be sincere and true. With no egregious or criminal intentions in mind, we might well become ‘someone else’, so as to keep alive more of who and what we actually are.</p>
