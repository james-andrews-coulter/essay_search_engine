        <h2>Explaining One’s Madness</h2>
<p>The Romantic vision of love posits the notion that people who are right for one another will have a deep, intuitive and accurate understanding of one another. As a result, the Romantic attitude relegates explanations of why one acts and feels and thinks as one does to the margins. One’s partner is supposed to understand all the important things already.</p>
<p>But there is another, perhaps more helpful attitude to adopt. This posits that all of us are both deeply mysterious (to ourselves and to others) and also in many ways so eccentric and so intriguingly disturbed that it would be quite appropriate to use the word ‘mad’ to sum up our nature. Furthermore, this theory argues that quite the kindest thing we can do for another person is to lay out with patience and imagination, ahead of any particular conflict or agitation, what one’s particular patterns of disturbance and difficulty might actually be. In a more enlightened society than ours, one of the first questions that partners would be expected to ask one another, and respond eloquently and undefensively to, on an early dinner date would simply be: ‘And how are you mad?’</p>
<p>A successful relationship always needs to be accompanied by a lot of explaining. This isn’t because we are especially strange, but simply because everyone emerges as puzzling and warped at close quarters. We have tendencies, desires, inclinations, enthusiasms, habits of mind and psychological zones that are very obscure. They stem from the strange interplay of the many factors which have shaped who we are: our unique intimate history of traumas, excitements, fears, influences, opportunities, misfortunes, talents and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Properly seen, though, our madder parts are not actually bad or vile. They are just unusual and at odds with the normal picture of what an adult is normally meant to be like. But if seen generously, it’s clear that they are not actually mean or cruel. The priority is therefore to try as best we can to help our partner make sense of us. Instead of hiding our peculiarities, we should (ideally quite early on, but it’s important at any point) actively flag them up. We should admit that we’re pretty odd in some ways and recognise that this can be alarming, until properly grasped. We should see explaining our stranger fears and desires in a way that’s helpful to one’s partner as a necessary, important and genuinely loving, part of being in any relationship. To be tolerable, we don’t need to be entirely sane, we just need to hand out – in a good-natured and unhostile way – accurate maps of one’s disturbances to one’s partner.</p>
<p>A degree of self-deprecating humour is a central mechanism for the self-explanation of our troublesome sides – and is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the true enemy of love: self-righteousness. Humour rehearses a highly desirable and useful shift in attitude, for comedy is full of characters who could be seen as grim, frightening or sinister but who we get to like because we are shown their foibles with a distinctive charm. Basil Fawlty would be a tricky husband to have in real life, but in a comedy by John Cleese he can appear as more than just an idiot; he can seem that much more tolerable being – a loveable fool. His vices are introduced to us alongside some deeply ingratiating qualities. The show teaches us to really like someone whom in real life we might have cursed; it is getting us to try out the unusual experience of simultaneously accepting that someone is crazy and still quite nice. We accept that Cleese’s character is sly, selfish, mean, incredibly tactless, snobbish and rude. And yet we like him. It’s a remarkable achievement on the part of the comedy team – and is rehearsing a move we badly need to make with our partners; a relationship takes an immense step forward when the parties can move from viewing their lovers as irritating idiots to considering them as loveable fools.</p>
<p>In this sense, comedy is developing an idea initially sketched by Jesus Christ. Christianity introduced the notion that a person could be of low social status, of ignoble appearance, of poor education and yet be fully deserving of love and consideration. Jesus was setting an example of liking people who could be described as very unimpressive, because, viewed in a particular light, pretty much everyone can be made to look a fool. The question is whether we have to see foolishness as inviting derision and contempt, or might come to view it as fully compatible with tenderness and affection – in fact, with love.</p>
<p>To say that a work colleague is a bit of a David Brent isn’t merely to point out that they are tactless and insecure. It’s also to reframe those failings, because we come to feel tender towards David Brent too. We see his vulnerability – not just his idiocy; we become good at recognising that it is his anxiety about not being liked or respected that leads him to do the deeply embarrassing things that make us laugh. For his part, Larry David is always getting angry and abusive. He is incredibly combative and rude to waiters; he gets into huge arguments with people at the dry-cleaners; he tells his friends what he thinks of their partners; he speaks his mind, even when it is profoundly inappropriate. But at the same time, he’s very charming. He’s a successful man, he has a lovely smile, and he can be very sweet. So we’re reframing the ‘grumpy old man’ as ‘the charming, very engaging old man, who is frequently rude too.’ The comic move is to guide us to a benevolent conception of people – and hence to the parts of ourselves and those close to us that share the same potentially very annoying characteristics.</p>
<p>At the heart of much comedy is a brilliant act of explanation. The makers latch onto a character who normally would seem weird and off-putting, but they guide us to see that they don’t need to be viewed that way. Instead of covering up or condemning the oddities, they explore the ongoing possibilities for love amidst the maddening flaws of human nature. For relationships to survive, it appears we too must take on – at key moments – some of the underlying perspectives of a great comedy writing team.</p>
