        <h3>¶ Philosophical Meditation</h3>
<p>Our minds are filled with out-of-focus feelings and ideas. We dimly experience a host of regrets, envious feelings, hurts, anxieties and resentments. But for the most part, we never stop to analyse or make sense of these. It seems too painful and difficult, because there is always an extra degree of anxiety that attends the process of beginning to think – whatever the eventual benefits.</p>
<p>However, the weight of our unthought thoughts and unfelt feelings can grow unbearable over time. They take their revenge on us for not giving them the attention they deserve. They wake us up in the middle of the night demanding to be heard; they give us twitches and, one day perhaps, serious illnesses. These neglected feelings and thoughts deserve to be examined and unfurled, for they contain a host of clues as to our future direction and needs. They are not merely clutter, as they might seem under a Buddhist lens; they are the jumbled jigsaw pieces of a future, better self.</p>
<p>It is in order to get a handle on the contents of our minds that we require the practice of Philosophical Meditation. Philosophical Meditation proposes that we regularly set aside a portion of time and systematically set ourselves to answer in detail three core questions: What am I currently anxious about that I haven’t properly acknowledged? What am I upset or hurt about that I haven’t yet fully understood? And what am I currently excited about that I haven’t yet clearly identified or had the courage to integrate into my ambitions?</p>
<p>The practice is built on the notion that our brains won’t manage to understand their own content without a considerable degree of artifice and training. We need to establish habits that can regularly prompt us to undertake the arduous work of figuring out what is going on in our own minds.</p>
