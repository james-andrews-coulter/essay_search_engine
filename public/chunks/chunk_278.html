            <h1>5. The 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise27</h1>
<p>Sit supported or lie down. Become aware of your breath. As you breathe, give each stage of your breathing a number:</p>
<p>1,   Inhale</p>
<p>2,   Top of in-breath</p>
<p>3,   Exhale</p>
<p>4,   Bottom of out-breath</p>
<p>Get used to counting with the breath. If you spend too little time at the top or at the bottom of the breath to apply numbers 2 and 4, slow yourself down until you are counting and breathing easily.</p>
<p>Now, as you count and breathe, bring in the observing part of your mind. Notice the subtle differences of emotion you experience with each stage of the breath. First of all, compare 1 and 3, then compare 2 and 4. Notice which is the most comfortable stage of the breath cycle for you and which is the least comfortable. Spend as much time as you need to do this.</p>
<p>When we have become aware of the nuances of our emotion on each number, we are going to exchange the numbers for a mantra. So you get the whole phrase in, you might need to lengthen the breath; if you are breathing slowly and have plenty of time, do not feel the need to speed up. Replace the numbers with the following phrases:</p>
<p>1,   I take from the world</p>
<p>2,   I make it my own</p>
<p>3,   I give back to the world</p>
<p>4,   I come back to myself</p>
<p>You can think about whether the phrases correlate with the moments of the breath cycle when you felt most and least comfortable, and whether there is any new information for you there. You can also use these mantras to meditate upon any interaction about which you feel self-righteous or otherwise emotionally charged. For example:</p>
<p>1,   (breathing in) I noticed someone taking my parking space (I take from the world)</p>
<p>2,   (top of the breath) I imagined they did it on purpose to spite me (I make it my own)</p>
<p>3,   (breathing out) I shouted at them not to park there (I give back to the world)</p>
<p>4,   (bottom of breath) I felt self-righteous (I come back to myself)</p>
<p>Then you could use the mantra to think about what you will do differently afterwards:</p>
<p>1,   (breathing in) I will notice someone taking my parking space (I take from the world)</p>
<p>2,   (top of the breath) I will not take this personally (I make it my own)</p>
<p>3,   (breathing out) I tell them I have paid for the space and public parking is around the corner; I make a bigger sign for the space (I give back to the world)</p>
<p>4,   (bottom of breath) I feel satisfied (I come back to myself)</p>
<p>A more positive example could be:</p>
<p>1,   (breathing in) I was taught by my aunt to bake (I take from the world)</p>
<p>2,   (top of the breath) I made up my own recipes (I make it my own)</p>
<p>3,   (breathing out) I pass my learning on (I give back to the world)</p>
<p>4,   (bottom of breath) It feels good (I come back to myself)</p>
<p>When discovering these exercises you may alight on a favourite. The 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise is mine. I do it at least once a week and usually more often. I love how, for me, it mirrors the experience of being alive, of taking in or reaching out and then returning to the self. It also mirrors how we each put our own particular spin (‘I make it my own’) on what we perceive.</p>
