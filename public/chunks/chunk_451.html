            <h2>Fear and Soothing</h2>
<p>The inner life of a properly fearful person is so tormented that an ordinary day is able to serve up more occasions for terror and trepidation than would, for most of us, a rafting trip down one of the world’s angriest rapids. On the outside, the fearful person may be doing nothing more remarkable than looking after a home or going to an office, but this tells us nothing about the scale of the challenges that they will be facing internally.</p>
<p>From the moment they wake up, they will be haunted by a succession of the cruelest ‘what ifs’. What if an email has arrived overnight detailing news of an illness or scandal? What if the newspaper carries a story about an event that might destroy their livelihood? What if their partner’s unusually severe or distracted manner is the first sign of a problem that ends in separation? What if the slight pain behind the eyes is the beginning of mental degeneration? What if they forgot to do something at work, which results in ruin? The questions never stop and nor does the worried person’s inability to find any satisfying and calming answers to them. Their worries flap and bang in the winds of the mind all day and night like a badly fastened shutter in a winter storm.</p>
<p>The fearful person doesn’t have a more frightening life than anyone else; they just lack the resources to extinguish the embers of worry that befall all of us in the course of an average day. At every turn, they end up with a major conflagration on their hands. The party they have to go to, the meeting they are attending, the letter they have to open, the social media feed they scroll through – each of these delivers yet another electric bolt of horror into their system.</p>
<p>How did life get to be so frightening for them? To understand this, we should travel far back in time and imagine a baby in the middle of the night. The room is dark, and the baby is hungry and wet right through. There is a terrible pain in their stomach and a tingly cold feeling all around their waist and their legs. Unable to work out what is wrong and without any means of altering it, the baby starts to scream, then ever louder, with all the desperation and strength in their young lungs; fast, panicky screams, begging for deliverance and assistance from multiple sources of pain that will not let up. Finally, after what felt like an age, but could in reality have been only a minute or two, a light comes on and, like a piece of supernatural intervention, the friendliest face in the world appears, illuminated from behind, with a gentle smile and encouraging eyes, and says: ‘Now, now, what seems to be the matter? It looks like poppet might want a feed and maybe a new nappy …’ The words don’t make any sense, but what happens next certainly does: the baby is lifted out of their cot, carefully changed, warmed and then settled at the breast, where they feed on the most satisfying and delicious meal that culinary art has ever produced, listening – in the background, alongside its own sucking noises – to the soft rhythm of a heart whose reassuring beats it remembers so well from the womb.</p>
<p>From such experiences, repeated over many months, the baby learns to develop a vital trust in life. There may be pain and there might be fear, but these aren’t eternal punishments. There are solutions to even the greatest terrors. A larger person can come along and make sense of the distress. The world doesn’t have to be filled with unending torment.</p>
<p>Later, if the young person’s luck holds, similar forms of alleviation will continue – when, for example, Teddy loses its leg, when a bottle falls off the table and shatters across the kitchen floor, when another child comes and steals a toy, when Granny is ill, when their bike crashes into a tree, when it’s the first day at school … At all such moments, a kindly adult is on hand to reassure, to contextualise, to explain, to offer sympathy, to look forward to better times and to plot alternative ways forward.</p>
<p>Through such manoeuvres, the child picks up the skill of soothing. Later on, when they have graduated, when they’re out in the world, when they have love affairs and dependents and responsibilities at work, the lessons of the early days will still reverberate and offer a toolkit with which upsets and reversals can be faced. There may be some genuinely thorny problems, but they don’t have to be a catastrophe; this won’t be the end. The robust person understands that there are a great many steps between a danger sign and collapse. With one side of them acting as parent to the other, they can tell themselves, ‘We may have loved them very much, but we will find others and have many good friends to see in the meanwhile,’ or ‘The criticism was very unfair and a little damaging, but we don’t need everyone to like us and have just enough support to continue as we are.’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, there are many less privileged people who have been gifted no such pacifying resources in their early lives. Perhaps when they screamed in the early hours, no adult came – or the one who did was as panicked as they were or seemed to be furious to be woken up at such an hour. Maybe the adult who came made the baby feel wicked for being so angry or was frightened by the intensity of the little one’s needs. Later on, it’s likely there was no easy recovery from a broken toy or a smashed bottle. Every graze generated an insuperable drama; every problematic moment at school was a cause of lasting commotion. From such experiences, there came a grave shortfall in the capacity for self-soothing. The muscle of the mind that might otherwise have argued the case for calm, forgiveness, perspective and compassion lacked any training. And therefore, there could only ever be a few short steps between a small reversal and a significant crisis: there could be no such thing as an insignificant or manageable problem. There could only ever be panic and cataclysm.</p>
<p>It may help us to understand our own fragilities to describe them as stemming from an inability to self-soothe. We are not wicked or dumb; we simply never learnt how to calm ourselves down because, long ago, no one else knew how to calm us down. We acquired lessons not in minimising the impact of reversals but in aggrandising minor misfortunes. We unwittingly became world experts in alarm.</p>
<p>With this sad knowledge painfully absorbed and mourned, we may be in a better position to learn – many decades later than we should – how to begin to utter a few calming affirmations in our minds. We can start to hunt out with greater vigour the sort of voices that should have been absorbed by our 3-month-old selves: the tranquillising tones of certain friends and authors, psychotherapists or lovers. The adult side of us can learn to play parent to a younger and more defenceless inner one. We can, metaphorically, stroke our own hair, wipe away our own tears – and feel sad that this form of nurture never came our way spontaneously in the early, jittery days.</p>
<p>In the process we will learn that we don’t live in an exceptionally dangerous world; we simply happen to have endured an exceptionally unsoothing past.</p>
