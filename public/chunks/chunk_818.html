        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We have accepted that it is a truly good idea to attend some classes before having children. This is now the norm for all educated people in all developed nations.</p>
<p>Yet there is as yet no widespread acceptability for the idea of taking classes before getting married. The results are around for all to see.</p>
<p>The time has come to bury the Romantic intuition-based view of marriage and to learn to practise and rehearse marriage as one would iceskating or violin playing, activities no more complex and no more deserving of systematic periods of instruction.</p>
<p>For now, while the infrastructure of new vows and classes is put in place, we all deserve untold sympathy for our struggles. We are trying to do something enormously difficult without the bare minimum of support necessary. It is not surprising if – very often – we don’t succeed.</p>
