        <h2>XVII: THE CRUSH ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>You are in a couple and are introduced to someone new at a conference. They look nice and you have a brief chat about the theme of the keynote speaker. But already, partly because of the slope of their neck and a lilt in their accent, you have reached an overwhelming conclusion. Or, you sit down in the train carriage and there, diagonally opposite you, is someone you cannot stop looking at for the rest of a journey across miles of darkening countryside. You know nothing concrete about them. You are going only by what their appearance suggests. You note that they have slipped a finger into a book, that they have a thin leather strap around their left wrist and that they are squinting a touch short-sightedly at the map above the door. And that is enough to convince you. Another day, coming out of the supermarket on your way home to your partner, amidst a throng of people, you catch sight of a face for no longer than eight seconds and yet here, too, you feel the same overwhelming certainty: You have a crush.</p>
<p>Crushes happen to some people often and to almost all of us sometimes. Airports, trains, streets, conferences – the dynamics of modern life are forever throwing us into fleeting contact with strangers, from among whom we pick out a few examples who seem to us not merely interesting, but more powerfully, the solution to our lives. Crushes could seem like negligible and absurd incidents, but they are also responsible for an enormous number of arguments and scratchy moments within couples.</p>
<p>When we return from the train ride or the conference, full of longing and desire, we are likely to be extremely dissatisfied with, or at least unpleasant around, our partner. In comparison with the divine being who has set our imagination in flight, all our partner’s faults seem especially in evidence: their lack of tact, their clumsiness, their poor sense of humour, their simultaneously unpassionate yet sometimes nagging nature. No wonder we may be tempted to manufacture an argument to give expression to our sadness and frustration.</p>
<p>We blame our partner for our own spectacular bad luck in having ended up with such mediocre love lives, without realising that we are mistaking an asymmetry of knowledge for an asymmetry of quality; we are failing to see that it isn’t the case that our partner is especially awful, but that we know them especially well. Our lovers are generally no worse than any charming stranger, but as they are familiar, their every failing has had a chance to be minutely charted.</p>
<p>The corrective to disproportionate knowledge is experience. We need to mine the secret reality of other people and so learn that, beneath their charms, they will almost invariably be essentially ‘normal’ in nature – that is, no worse yet no better than the candidates we already have in our lives.</p>
<p>The primary error of the crush lies in overlooking a central fact about people in general, not merely this or that example, but the species as a whole: that everyone has something very substantially wrong with them once their characters are fully known, something so wrong as to make an eventual mockery of the unlimited rapture unleashed by the crush. We can’t yet know what the problems will be, but we can and should be certain that they are there, lurking somewhere behind the facade, waiting for time to unfurl them.</p>
<p>How can we be so sure? Because the facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. There is too much to fear: mortality, loss, dependency, abandonment, ruin, humiliation, subjection.</p>
<p>We are, all of us, desperately fragile, ill-equipped to meet with the challenges to our mental integrity. We lack courage, preparation, confidence, intelligence. We don’t have the right role models; we were (necessarily) imperfectly parented; we fight rather than explain, nag rather than teach; we fret instead of analysing our worries; we have a precarious sense of security; we can’t understand either ourselves or others well enough; we don’t have an appetite for the truth and suffer a fatal weakness for flattering denials. The chances of a perfectly good human emerging from the perilous facts of life are non-existent. Our fears and our frailties play themselves out in a thousand ways; they can make us defensive or aggressive, grandiose or hesitant, clingy or avoidant – but we can be sure that they will make everyone much less than perfect and, at moments, extremely hard to live with.</p>
<p>The solution to the arguments that follow from a crush is to extrapolate from what we already know about people in general and apply it to those we don’t yet know. The most plausible generalisation we can make about unknown people is that they are likely to be closer to what we’ve already experienced than they are to being completely – and bountifully – different. The cure for love is to get to know them better … We should accept, with good grace and a touch of dark humour, that life simply gives us few opportunities to be totally content.</p>
