        <h2>The Family Trip</h2>
<p>We thought we had come to see a patch of countryside or a temple, a canal or a capital — but what emerges is that these are only incidental and secondary stage-sets that permit a far more complicated and important project to unfold: that of understanding and connecting with the young people that we helped put on the earth. However much we strive to get on in normal surroundings, it’s only when we have left home that we are forced out of the roles that silently estrange us, and become a family.</p>
<p>For a start, the family trip shatters the customary hierarchies. It no longer matters who is ostensibly what age. New, unexpected vulnerabilities — and skills — emerge. A father turns out to be surprisingly inept at unmooring the boat and worries intensely about getting splashed in the pool; a small boy knows exactly where to put down the anchor and can dive and swim without a care. A mother who is normally intimidated by nothing blushes when she has to explain what she needs in a foreign pharmacy. A parent might be in charge of twenty adults in an office, but when it comes to trying to find garlic in a market, they are the equal of an intrepid 9-year-old, who leads them firmly by the hand through the crowds.</p>
<p>The trip will be full of inconveniences that, at the time, seem as though they detract from the point of being away. With hindsight, we will see that they were, in reality, the crucial incidents. They were what did the work of humanising us and forcing us to understand and forgive each other. It was, in truth, an advantage that we couldn’t find the hotel late at night, that the roundabout was wrongly marked, that the food at the inn was repulsive, that we suffered a two-hour detour and that we found a bathroom with only seconds to spare.</p>
<p>The trip will shake us from our normal assumptions about what matters. Of course, the 2,000-year-old monument is of importance in understanding the development of Indo-European civilisation, but there is something significant, too, in the fascination of an 8-year-old with the honey on sale at the roadside or with the lizard rooted on the wall outside the room. Even if the Byzantine architects did cover a church in gold and turquoise tiles that may have been sourced from Persia, they never had a chance to see the adorable basset hound loitering on the steps of the building. And whatever the appeal of the large abstract entity known as ‘Japan’ or ‘Spain’, these will in the end always have to take second place to a hotel breakfast buffet that seized the imagination of our young fellow traveller (there were seven different kinds of pastries and three sorts of juices!) and will be mentioned in a speech at their wedding in twenty-four years’ time.</p>
<p>The trip was far from flawless. There were many arguments. There was a lost watch and a damaged toe. We will need a long rest on our return. But amidst the turmoil, something compelling developed, nevertheless: we grew more patient, we looked through others’ eyes. We didn’t see half of what we had hoped, but we learned about love.</p>
