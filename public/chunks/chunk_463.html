        <h3>Processing time</h3>
<p>The anxious-yet-wise also know to allow plenty of time in which to ‘process’ experiences. That is, to sift through what has happened in order to put it into perspective, tease out any worrying elements, return ideas to more reasonable forms and plan a way out of any dreaded eventualities. To do this we must sit in a comfortable place, in an armchair or by the window, probably with a pen and paper, and go through what has gone on, occasionally jotting something down, circling a word or connecting sentences with arrows. We should tend to matters like skilful gardeners, removing new shoots of worry and raking the weeds of our minds. The wise adult knows that enough goes on in an average day of an active life to fill half an hour or more of processing time – and that insomnia and stretches of panic are likely to be our minds’ revenge for the thoughts we have carefully managed not to have when we are ‘busy’. As enlightened souls, we will be hard-working enough to allow ourselves plenty of time to ‘do nothing’ – other than reflect and recollect.</p>
