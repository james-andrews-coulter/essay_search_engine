        <h2>10.  Creative Play</h2>
<p>Work and relationships are the central pillars of our lives – at least, as most of us wish to live them; but there is another kind of activity which can engage us completely, and which both philosophers and psychoanalysts have considered just as essential to our development, and, indeed, to the development of culture. This is the often underestimated category of creative play. Although ‘play’ in all its forms can be highly pleasurable and involving, I would like to distinguish creative play from such activities as games or sports, in which the rules are prescribed in advance and the aim – winning – strictly and narrowly defined. By creative play, I mean something both more improvised and more – well, creative; that is, activities which leave room for imaginative exploration and discovery, as well as for unexpected results. Of course, play pervades many areas of life. Both work and relationships contain elements of happy playfulness, if we have achieved a certain level of ease and spontaneity within them; scientific discoveries are not infrequently made by dint of playful experimentation; and creative endeavour almost necessarily involves elements of playing around – with sounds, paint or words – as well as intense mental and imaginative effort.</p>
<p>In a wonderful book called Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, Johan Huizinga, a Dutch philosopher, suggests that both art and ritual, as well as (on the less happy end of the spectrum) war, emerge from a kind of playfulness: giving form which is both gratuitous and serious to important human activities, and to early intuitions about the human relationship to the universe or to each other. In Huizinga’s analysis, our very ability to know emerges from a kind of conceptual playfulness. He particularly mentions certain archaic games – riddles, formal exchanges of questions and answers – which may be a very early form of gaining understanding through dialogue, of a back-and-forth between an acolyte and a spiritual authority. (Sometimes, such early games were played for pretty high stakes: if you couldn’t answer the ‘fatal riddle’ of the Sphinx, death awaited!)</p>
<p>If play is at the root of culture, it is perhaps because the ability and the need to play seem to be built not only into our nature, but the nature of much animal life. Cats and dogs certainly play not only with each other, but with humans, as anyone who has had pets can testify. In children, the ability to play arises naturally if it is not hampered, and is necessary to full development. In the observations of the British psychoanalyst W. D. Winnicott, the child initially plays in the ‘safe space’ created by the proximity of a caring adult, by experimenting, say, with various arrangements of blocks. Such experimentation seems to be both an urge and a need of human consciousness; and in Winnicott’s view, it is the origin of later cultural activity and the serious play of creative work.</p>
<p>We don’t have to be classified as ‘creative workers’, however, to feel the appetite for creative play or to benefit from its pleasures. There are cultures which have rich traditions of amateur creativity and experimentation, and British history is filled with examples. (Darwin, after all, was an amateur, and pursued his preoccupations without any assurance of results or rewards.) Before the beginning of the digital era, London (and undoubtedly other parts of the British Isles) was home to a wide variety of amateur activity in its still less hectic precincts: amateur chamber music groups and theatrical performances; people trying to breed new varieties of plants, or create devices for body-propelled flight. Possibly some very concrete results came out of such experiments, although for the people involved that was not the main point. ‘Amateur’ means literally ‘lover of’, and amateur endeavours are undertaken for the love of the thing itself. For the people engaged in them, such activities constitute a kind of ‘free space’ in which to give vent to their curiosities and abilities, without the constraints of competitiveness or worry.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to be enjoyable, creative activities have to be undertaken seriously enough to be executed at a certain level of competence. Performing a Haydn quartet is no fun if it consists mostly of halting phrases and wrong notes; the point of staging an Oscar Wilde comedy, however informally, is lost if the actors muddle up their entrances and lines. Work contains elements of play, and in order to be pleasurable, creative play has to contain an element of strenuous effort – of concentration and discipline. It also needs to have form and structure. Both in childhood and later on, play is the non-instrumental use of the imagination, allowing it to wander where it will – but it turns out that the imagination, if it is allowed free rein, looks for and finds structure pretty fast. Children improvise rules for their interactive games – otherwise, they are not games, and no fun. Mature creativity also needs to find its forms in order to be satisfying. Playfulness gives expression to the sheer vitality of consciousness, and it depends on improvisation and cognitive flexibility, but it may also be a demonstration of our need to make sense of what we perceive and discover.</p>
<p>The urge to play is instinctive in children, and intrinsic to much cultural activity.</p>
<p>In the digital era, amateur activities have largely been replaced by virtual games, which are both a huge business and, for their devotees, a diverting and sometimes highly addictive pastime. It may be that such games increase alertness, as some of their advocates claim. But they do not call on our capacities for inventiveness or mental exploration. The invention, in these games, has already been done for you; the player’s role is to respond, even if the range of response can be fairly wide. Crucially, digital games do not engage our bodies or physical skills. They involve the same limited actions as all our other transactions with digital technologies: the clicking of buttons, or moving a computer mouse on a desk surface.</p>
<p>In contrast to the constricted spaces of digital games, creative play is a way of exploring and expressing the full range of mental and imaginative possibilities freely, and most often through physical action. This can be as meaningful and absorbing as more functional or ostensibly serious projects. One famous example of someone who took creative exploration very seriously, even while being involved in the most serious possible endeavour, was Winston Churchill, who throughout much of his career remained a dedicated amateur painter – and for whom this ‘pastime’ played an important role in his emotional life. Churchill, who suffered from lifelong depression (which he called his ‘black dog’), said that painting ‘came to his rescue’ at a difficult time, and he devoted many hours to it throughout his career, even as he was commanding armies during World War II. This, for him, was hardly a frivolous hobby. Indeed, he compared thinking about painting to the process of making strategic decisions; and it may be that allowing our minds to move freely, whether in considering a scientific problem or the form of a painting, is the best way of arriving at complex conclusions and decisions. Churchill did not have professional ambitions as an artist, but he worked hard at it and gave it his entire concentration; and his reward was what we would now call the state of flow. ‘I know of nothing which more entirely absorbs the mind,’ he wrote. ‘All one’s mental light becomes concentrated on the task.’</p>
<p>Play may seem like a cultural luxury, an extra; but cultures that lose their ability to play become repressive and static (think of the more severe forms of sharia law, with their restrictions on aesthetic pleasure). Indeed, in its various forms – from high to low, from frivolous to serious – play may be both at the root of culture, and one of its high achievements: an expression of basic human freedom, and of the need for freedom in order to be fully ourselves.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>There are many ways to live; but to live meaninglessly is to miss your life. If we rush through our days and months in ceaseless activity, and without taking stock of what we’re doing, we can soon lose track of what we are doing it for, or why it matters to us. If we are not to move through our activities mindlessly, or to denude our experiences of significance and depth, we need to orient ourselves in our lives – and within ourselves: to muse, relish, reflect and occasionally even to be bored.</p>
<p>In order to live lives worth living – so the old philosophers taught us – we need to know who we are, and to be guided by deliberately chosen aims and purposes; and for that, we need, in our busy lives, to give time to the cultivation of knowledge, and the practices of self-knowledge. We live in demanding, individualistic, diverse societies – and beyond that, in a complex, interconnected, often turbulent world. The conflicts, catastrophes, triumphs and ordinary human struggles in all parts of the globe enter our lives via vivid images on television screens or on those smaller ones. Such awareness implicates us; and it is part of being a sentient and responsible person to think about the larger world we live in, and respond to it in ways which reflect our values and our understanding. But if we are to give value to our own lives, we also need to nurture our perceptions and internal resources, to cultivate our capacity for play and pleasure, and to draw on our knowledge and self-knowledge in order to use ourselves wisely and well. A sense of meaning which allows us to be fully alive comes from our involvement with others and engagement in the world; and it comes, above all, from within.</p>
