        <h1>Mentalization</h1>
<p>The psychoanalyst Peter Fonagy coined the word ‘mentalization’. This means the ability to understand our inner experience, and from that, work out accurately the other person’s feelings. This process gives us the ability to make and sustain healthy relationships. If all goes well, we have early caregivers who carry out this process of mentalization naturally, and we pick it up unconsciously from them. This process is aided by self-observation, because as we develop and become more sensitive to our own feelings we also become more sensitive to what other people are feeling. This does not mean projecting our own thoughts onto them, but understanding, on the level of feeling, that the way they feel and think might be different from the way we do.</p>
<p>If we find people so unpredictable that we are unable to relate to anyone, then it is probable that it is the process of mentalization that is letting us down. There is so much that is unspoken and unconscious in the process of relating to another that the only way to learn it is in relationship with someone else. If our earliest caregiver was unable to provide a model for mentalization we will not have learnt it from them. But the brain is plastic. We can learn it later in life with a psychotherapist or in other close relationships. When we begin to understand what it really feels like to be deeply understood, we can begin to understand others and have satisfying relationships.</p>
<p>When psychotherapy began it was about the practitioner listening to a patient and interpreting what the patient said, in order to afford the patient insights about his or her psyche. But now we understand that the main curative part of psychotherapy is the relationship itself. It appears not to be relevant whether the practitioner is an analytic Freudian or a counselling Rogerian12, a transactional analyst or a life coach, or from an eclectic school. What matters is the quality of the relationship and the practitioner’s belief in what he or she is offering. In the same way, our sanity and our happiness will have more to do with our interpersonal relationships than with what the weather is like, or what job we do, or our hobbies. We run about, earning a living, achieving things and making a decent show of it all (or not), but what affects us most are the people around us: our parents, our children, our lovers, our colleagues, our neighbours and our friends. As the psychotherapist Louis Cozolino says, ‘From birth until death, each of us needs others who seek us out, show interest in discovering who we are and help us feel safe.’ A trauma consultant puts it more starkly, ‘Everyone should walk through an Emergency Room at least once in their life. Because it makes you realize what your priorities are. It’s not the rush, rush, rush and the money, money, money; it’s the people you love and the fact that one minute they might be there and one minute they might be gone.’13</p>
<p>Staying connected with others is a vital – the vital – part of staying sane.</p>
