        <h3>2They’re not who they at first seemed to be</h3>
<p>For many of us, love starts very quickly, often at first sight: with a sudden overwhelming impression of the other’s loveliness. This phenomenon – the crush – goes to the heart of the modern understanding of love. It could seem like a small incident, a minor planet in the constellation of love, but it is in fact the underlying secret central sun around which our notions of the Romantic revolve. A crush represents in pure and perfect form the essential dynamics of Romanticism: the explosive interaction of limited knowledge, outward obstacles to further discovery, and boundless hope.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be able to develop crushes if we weren’t so good at allowing a few details about someone to suggest the whole of them. From a few cues only – the depth of their eyes, their handsome brow or a handful of funny comments – we rapidly start to anticipate an intense connection and years of happiness, buoyed by profound mutual sympathy and understanding. We have a proclivity for developing life-long certainties in an instant.</p>
<p>We pay dearly for our haste as any relationship progresses. We are all, of course, a perplexing and boundless mixture of good and bad. The primary error behind our passionate early feelings is that we overlook a central fact about people: everyone has something substantially wrong with them once their characters are fully known.</p>
<p>The facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one has come through unscathed. We all lack courage, preparation, confidence and intelligence. We don’t have the right role models; we were (necessarily) imperfectly parented; we fight rather than explain; we nag rather than teach; we fret instead of analysing our worries; we have a precarious sense of security; we can’t understand either ourselves or others well enough; we don’t have an appetite for the truth, and suffer a fatal weakness for flattering denials. The chances of a perfectly good human emerging from the perilous facts of life are non-existent. Our fears and our frailties play out in a thousand ways. They can make us defensive or aggressive; grandiose or hesitant; clingy or avoidant. Unfortunate tendencies exist in us all, and will make everyone much less than perfect and, at times, extremely hard to live with.</p>
<p>Every human can be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us – and we will do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. This is a truth chiselled indelibly into the script of life. Choosing who to marry or commit ourselves to is therefore merely a case of identifying a kind of misery we can bear rather than an occasion miraculously to escape from grief altogether.</p>
<p>We should enjoy our crushes. The person on the train probably does have a beguiling air of self-deprecation in their eyes. The person glimpsed by the fresh fruit counter really does promise to be a gentle and excellent parent, friend and lover. But these characters will, just as importantly and inevitably, also be sure to frustrate our lives in key ways if ever we begin to know and love them.</p>
<p>Romantic Realism simply takes it for granted that one person should not be asked to be everything to another. With this truth accepted, we can look for ways to accommodate ourselves as gently and as kindly as we can to the awkward realities of life beside another fallen creature: never feeling betrayed by, or furious about, their imperfections and apologising heartily, early and constantly for ours.</p>
<p>If we do start a relationship, we should never blame our one-time angel for not really being who they seemed at the start. It is just that we decided who they were without checking. They haven’t become awful. They were just always tricky, as we all are. In a wiser culture than our own, those who fell in love would be immediately judged as suffering from a passing mental disease and their opinions handled with extreme caution, rather than being anointed courageous visionaries able to perceive something important about another person.</p>
<p>The only people we can think of as amazing are those we don’t yet know very well. However, accepting that everyone is maddening is no reason to give up on relationships; it is simply a sign that we are finally getting to know human nature.</p>
