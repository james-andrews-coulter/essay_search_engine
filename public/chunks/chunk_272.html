        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So how do we stay sane? We can develop our faculties of self-observation so that we can have the capacity to observe even our strongest emotions, rather than being defined by them, allowing ourselves to take in the bigger picture. Self-observation helps us to avoid too much self-justification and getting stuck in patterns of behaviour that no longer work for us. We can prioritize nurturing relationships and allow ourselves to be open. We can relate – not as who we think we should be, but who we actually are, thus giving ourselves the chance to connect and form bonds with others. We can seek out ‘good stress’ to keep our minds and bodies fit for purpose, and we can be watchful of the stories we hear and the belief systems we live our lives by. We can edit our story at any time, to right ourselves if we veer off course either into chaos or rigidity.</p>
<p>Is it that easy? No, it isn’t. One of the things that can give us the illusion of sanity is certainty; yet certainty is a trap. On the other hand, we can swing too far in the opposite direction and become so unsure that we never set off on any path. Extremes appear not to be the best way forward for sanity. I say make a mark, put a foot onto the path, see (and feel and think) how it lands; and then you can make a good guess about where to put the next foot. And if you start to go off in the wrong direction, it is never too late to change course.</p>
<p>I hope reading about how to stay sane has been helpful. To get more out of this book, work through the exercises in the next section.</p>
