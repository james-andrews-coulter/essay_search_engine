        <h4>1. Face the Fear</h4>
<p>On the very first page of this book I observed that in a practical sense it is not actually very difficult to be alone. Almost everyone is alone some of the time. So any
  suggestions for developing a happier relationship with solitude are going to be building on your actual experience. This should be encouraging.</p>
<p>Of course there are people for whom solitude is in reality far more difficult to find than I have implied: for example, the single parent of 2-year-old triplets; people living with some sorts of
  physical illness, disability or other high-dependency condition; those confined in overcrowded prisons, forced to share a cell; young people with overanxious and controlling parents. But for most
  of us it is not that complicated. Even those whose circumstances apparently make it hard can refer themselves to Catherine of Siena (1347–1380), who, despite living in a household where there
  were at least twelve children (her mother had twenty-five babies but many of them did not survive, so the numbers changed frequently) and the family cloth-dying business was carried on, managed to
  create for herself a ‘hermitage of the heart’. ‘Build a cell inside your mind,’ she instructed someone later, ‘from which you can never flee.’ Even her family
  came to recognize and acknowledge that she was a ‘solitary’; that she lived alone within that communal household.</p>
<p>If you cannot find any regular solitude, any way to be alone, within the rhythm of your ordinary life, then at some level you might be avoiding it; if in addition you feel disgust or
  contempt towards those who do prefer solitude to company, ask yourself if perhaps you are projecting and scapegoating. These behaviours are classic symptoms of fear.</p>
<p>Although we now use the word ‘phobia’ (from the Greek: [img]óβος, Phóbos, meaning ‘fear’ or ‘morbid fear’) pretty
  loosely, for psychologists it is a distinct clinical condition. Wikipedia’s definition is: ‘A marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence or
  anticipation of a specific object or situation.’ It is seen as a type of anxiety disorder and has clear diagnostic criteria. Among these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phobic situation(s) is avoided or else is endured with intense anxiety or distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The avoidance, anxious anticipation or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person‘s normal routine, occupational (or academic)
        functioning or social activities or relationships.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Among the clinically recognized ‘phobic stimuli’ are various aspects of aloneness: autophobia is the fear of being isolated or alone; monophobia is the fear of
  solitude.</p>
<p>A survey in 2008 suggested that more than 13 million people in the UK have a terror of being out of mobile-phone contact. These individuals experience anxiety and panic symptoms when they run
  out of battery or credit, lose their phone or have no network coverage. They are suffering from ‘no-mobile phobia’, which has been given the name nomophobia and could affect up
  to 53 per cent of mobile-phone users.</p>
<p>Of course I am not seriously contending that everyone who cannot enjoy being alone has a pathological psychological disorder, but there some interesting parallels. For example, phobias are often
  ‘learned’ or inherited, rather than acquired through a particular traumatic encounter. They have a strong cultural element. The real reason why I am looking at phobias here, however, is
  because of the ways they can be treated.</p>
<p>The standard, and highly effective, treatment for phobias is a combination of CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, a popular talking therapy that seeks to change how you think and what you do to
  help you feel better) and desensitization. Using this as a model, I would suggest that the best treatment for a non-clinical fear of being alone is learning more about it and exposing yourself to
  solitude, initially in very low ‘doses’:</p>
<p>Accept the fact that fear is at least one element in your dislike and avoidance of solitude.</p>
<p>Study the benefits and joys of being alone (read this book – and others suggested in the ‘homework’ section).</p>
<p>Build up various strategies for being alone, starting with the least threatening and most pleasurable ones you can imagine.</p>
<p>If you can tolerate solitude in the shower – have a bath instead: it takes longer, and because it is quieter it is easier to be aware of being alone. Become more aware
        of moments of solitude and how they make you feel.</p>
<p>Spend some time alone where there are other people, but only those not known to you; railway travel is good for this, and so is shopping alone.</p>
<p>Spend the evening in a different room from the rest of your household.</p>
<p>Turn your mobile off. Remember, 8 per cent of the adults in Britain – over 5 million of us – do not have a mobile phone. Large swathes of the country do not have
        even 2G coverage. But life goes on.</p>
<p>Start small.</p>
<p>You may surprise yourself. Once you feel secure in accessing solitude you may find that you like it, and feel its benefits and its joys; you cannot know until you try.</p>
<p>That is what happened to me. I had never lived alone in my life. I had never wanted to live alone. I perceived myself as a deeply sociable, extroverted human being with a particular grace for
  friendship and highly sophisticated, noisy discussion. When asked, I would say my favourite leisure activity, my hobby, was deipnosophy (‘the art of or skill in dinner-table
  conversation’). When my marriage ended and I went to live alone in a little thatched cottage, I was constructing myself as the selfless heroine of a tragic failed love story. I was eagerly
  anticipating being thoroughly miserable and having one more thing to ‘blame’ my ex-husband for.</p>
<p>Spend some time alone where there are other people, but only those not known to you; railway travel is good for this.</p>
<p>My subconscious was a great deal smarter than my conscious mind.</p>
<p>I started small. My first home alone was a semi-detached cottage in a small village, barely an hour outside London. My son came up at weekends; my friends visited; for some of the time I had
  part-time jobs of a distinctly non-solitary kind (I was a writer-in-residence in a prison for two years). So I was only getting small doses of solitude initially. But, for me, it did not take long;
  I could feel myself relax and expand; I had more energy, both for work and for physical exercise. I got fitter. I slowed down, woke up earlier and started to see the world more sweetly and in more
  detail. Since I started living alone I have less and less trouble with the depression that I had assumed, throughout my adult life, was a part of my personality.</p>
<p>It took me nearly two years to realize what it was that was making me so happy. Then I got greedier and greedier for solitude: now, as I said, I live in rather splendid isolation in a house
  designed (by me) for solitary living, in an area where most days I do not see anyone. The joy of long periods of solitude has also increased my joy in non-solitude: I love my children, my friends,
  my colleagues as much as ever, and I attend to them better when I am with them – and enjoy them more. But, above all, I like me better. I think there is more of me to like – a deep
  spaciousness of self, joyful, creatively and professionally productive and alert to both my interior and exterior life.</p>
<p>Try it out for yourself. Respect but do not fear your own fear. Do not let it come between you and something that might be deeply enjoyable. Remember it is quite normal to be a bit frightened of
  being alone. Most of us grew up in a social environment that sent out the explicit message that solitude was bad for you: it was bad for your health (especially your mental health) and bad for your
  ‘character’ too. Too much of it and you would promptly become weird, psychotic, self-obsessed, very possibly a sexual predator and rather literally a wanker. Mental (and even physical)
  well-being, along with virtue, depends, in this model, on being a good mixer, a team-player, and having high self-esteem, plus regular, uninhibited, simultaneous orgasms with one partner (at a
  time).</p>
<p>Actually, of course, it is never this straightforward because at the same time as pursuing this ‘extrovert ideal’, society gives out an opposite – though more subterranean
  – message. Most people would still rather be described as sensitive, spiritual, reflective, having rich inner lives and being good listeners, than the more extroverted opposites. I think we
  still admire the life of the intellectual over that of the salesman; of the composer over the performer (which is why pop stars constantly stress that they write their own songs); of the craftsman
  over the politician; of the solo adventurer over the package tourist. People continue to believe, in the face of so much evidence – films, for example – that Great Art can only be
  produced by solitary geniuses. But the kind of unexamined but mixed messages that society offers us in relation to being alone add to the confusion; and confusion strengthens fear.</p>
<p>One of the best antidotes to fear is knowledge. To press the analogy a little, this is the CBT element that goes hand-in-hand with ‘desensitization’ in the effective treatment of
  phobias.</p>
<p>But in reality there is nothing to be frightened of. There is no evidence whatsoever that even prolonged periods of being alone are detrimental to physical or mental health, so long as that
  solitude is freely chosen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the arena of health, it is quite tricky to find that helpful knowledge: the effectiveness of solitude has not been tested by NICE and recommended as a – remarkably cheap
  – NHS therapeutic intervention. In Solitude, Anthony Storr comments:</p>
<p>Today, the fact that isolation can be therapeutic is seldom mentioned in textbooks of psychiatry. The emphasis is on group participation . . . [I] regret that the average
    mental hospital can make little provision for those patients who want to be alone and who would benefit from being so.</p>
<p>In consequence it is quite hard to find facts and figures on the effects (negative as well as positive) of solitude in relation to health. ‘Being alone is good for your
  health’ is exactly the sort of proposition that is singularly difficult to test. You would need a very large-scale longitudinal study, with a control group, to measure anything useful,
  because of the problems of eliminating all the random factors that can so easily sneak in here.</p>
<p>It is not just a matter of ‘lies, damned lies and statistics’, it is also about what research gets funded. And in the absence of full, meticulous, controlled experimental research it
  becomes startling easy for people to read almost anything they want to into figures.</p>
<p>Here, to put a case that undermines my own, is a statement about floatation tanks (floatation tanks are devices offered by spas or alternative health centres, and consist of a ‘bath’
  filled with highly salinated, body-temperature water, in which the user can float without effort; they have closed lids and are basically anacoustic – you bob there in the dark, certainly
  alone and also deprived of most sensory input). A tank:</p>
<p>Promotes total calm, peaceful relaxation, eliminates fatigue and jet lag; improves sleep; alleviates stress – mental and physical; energizes, rejuvenates and
        revitalizes.</p>
<p>Stimulates left/right brain synchronization; shifts brain waves from Beta to lower-frequency Alpha, Theta and even Delta; creates mental clarity, alertness; increases
      creativity, problem-solving; heightens visualization; deepens meditation; expands awareness, intensifies acuteness of all the senses, accelerates learning.</p>
<p>Enhances hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis; increases motivation, diminishes depression, anxiety and fear; facilitates freedom from habits, phobias and addictions.</p>
<p>Improves athletic performance and helps prevent sports injuries, speeds healing process.</p>
<p>Decreases the production of cortisol, ACTH, lactic acid and adrenaline; increases production of endorphins; quickens rehabilitation and recovery; relieves pain –
      arthritis, migraines, injuries etc.; boosts immune function.</p>
<p>Improves circulation and distribution of oxygen and nutrients; reduces blood pressure, pulse, heart-rate and oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>I have seen this list quoted in various places as a proof that Floatation is good for you, but there are no citations, no figures, no indication of which ‘bit’ of
  the experience is so multiply enhancing. Then it transpires that the original can be found on the website of the Floatation Tank Association – it is an advertisement. Actually I have no
  reason to believe that any of this is not true, and I do appreciate the enormous difficulties that many alternative therapies of all sorts find in getting decent trials up and running.
  Moreover I am, from personal experience and wide reading, happily convinced that solitude is good for one’s health (mental and physical), but in terms of offering authoritative scientific
  reassurance to counter the common fears, I am not entirely happy with the available data.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is better to approach this question anecdotally, through ‘case histories’. Because lives of solitude have been seen by so many different societies as both heroic and
  bizarre, there is a kind of fascination in solitary practitioners and therefore a fairly steady stream of biographical literature, across a prolonged historical period and from a range of cultures.
  It is not difficult to find a wide selection of individuals who practised a wide range of solitary lifestyles and simply look and see if there is any suggestion that being alone is dangerous rather
  than beneficial.</p>
<p>Anthony the Great (AD 251–356) is widely credited as the first Christian hermit, and the founding father of monasticism. In 285 he went out into the Egyptian desert
  and lived in complete isolation in a ruined fort at Der el Memum (Pispir) for twenty years. Athanasius, his friend and biographer, describes his emergence from this long solitude in some detail.
  Anthony announced his intention of coming out and sent for some local workmen to help him dismantle his protective ‘fortifications’. This attracted a curious crowd who, Athanasius says,
  were very all very ‘surprised’ to find he was neither emaciated nor deranged, suggesting clearly that this was the expectation. But he emerged physically fit and eminently in his right
  mind.</p>
<p>Despite these negative expectations, the rest of Anthony’s life seems remarkably sane; and he lived to an extreme old age (105, according to tradition, at a period when life expectancy was
  much lower than it now is), alone in the desert, still physically and mentally fully active, so his health was evidently not damaged. He spent the five or six years after he left Pispir sharing his
  experiences and training and organizing the new movement that had grown up around his fort. His success in both establishing a genuinely innovative spirituality and in creating structures that
  enabled the whole desert-hermit movement to develop over the following three centuries (and expand in an adapted form into Europe and become the basic impulse for monasteries) hardly suggests any
  serious damage.</p>
<p>After this teaching period he withdrew again into solitude, which he pursued with ‘joyful determination’ on his so called ‘inner mountain’. This second period of
  solitude, which lasted for the remaining forty-five years of his life, lacked the extremity and rigour of his time in Pispir. He freely met and talked with those who came out to see him, sometimes
  walked back to visit his community in Pispir and, according to Athanasius, went twice to Alexandria. He was very much loved and respected, partly for his serene good humour and tranquil heart.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the fact that he remained abundantly normal did not change the common terror that solitude was likely to drive people mad.</p>
<p>Anthony’s life-pattern, a period of training, a period of extreme isolation, followed by teaching and public ministry and then a gentler withdrawal into seclusion, has been repeated ever
  since with surprising frequency and across a range of cultures. Tenzin Palmo is a contemporary example who has followed Anthony’s old road.</p>
<p>Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo is a British-born Tibetan Buddhist nun and probably one of the best-known solitaries of our time. She was born in 1943 in Hertfordshire, but moved to India when she was
  twenty and began training, the only woman in a community of over 100 male monks. She found this, not surprisingly, very difficult, as she felt she was often deprived of both higher teaching and
  respect because of her gender, and she gradually moved into a life of more solitude. From 1976 she lived for twelve years alone in a cave in the Himalayas, and for the last three of these in
  complete isolation. Even though her solitude was broken into in an abrupt and potentially damaging way (one day a policeman arrived saying she had twenty-four hours to appear in the nearest town as
  her visa had expired and she had to leave the country), she appeared unruffled and healthy. She also emerged with a great determination to improve the position of Buddhist nuns. She spent the
  following years in Europe teaching, lecturing and raising funds for what, in 2000, became the Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in Himachal Pradesh, India. Again, like Anthony, after this period of
  teaching and organizing she is speaking again of ‘retreat’, of going back to her solitary lifestyle.</p>
<p>Like Anthony too she seems marked not just by sanity but by a benign and slightly ironic humour. She appears tolerant, witty and articulate and the many pictures of her show a woman in her
  seventies in good health and spirits. She is, apparently, an extraordinarily good public speaker and teacher, and continues to work, with considerable success, for the spiritual rights of Buddhist
  women.</p>
<p>Tenzin Palmo: Marked not just by sanity but by a benign and slightly ironic humour.</p>
<p>Sadly, a number of individuals embracing a life of radical solitude have gone very mad indeed – like Marguerite de la Rocque, marooned for two years on an island in the St Lawrence Seaway
  in 1641, who was assaulted and haunted by demons, although she recovered on her return to France, or Alexander Selkirk, the probable model for Robinson Crusoe, who was never able to return to
  social life after his rescue, and lived in a cave in Scotland – but so have a number of people who have not spent any significant time alone. Overall I can find no evidence whatsoever that
  there is a higher incidence of lunacy, chronic ill health or early death among the solitary than in the population at large, though I admit that this would be extremely difficult to measure.
  Although there are intense experiences and sometimes frightening issues to work through, being alone can be beneficial and is certainly not detrimental to well-being, provided the individuals
  have freely chosen it. A good deal of the ‘scientific evidence’ for the danger to physical and mental health comes from studies of people in solitary confinement. There is no
  question that compulsory punitive isolation is extremely dangerous to the human psyche – and can lead to a particularly hideous form of psychosis. But to compare freely chosen adventures into
  the world’s wilder places, or the experience of the divine and the depth of the self, to the ordeal of prisoners is a bit like comparing the feelings of a woman pregnant with a wanted baby,
  basking in support and encouragement, to a woman similarly pregnant but as a consequence of rape, and facing shame and poverty. Of course no one should expect them to feel the same way.</p>
<p>So the biggest danger of solitude is fear – and often fear mixed with both the derision and judgement of others. Those exploring solitude can reasonably anticipate accusations of madness,
  selfishness and stupidity; and since of course there are going to be elements of all three in all of us, these can sink their barbs in deep, depriving us of joy, confidence and faith; and into the
  space thus created madness, egotism and idiocy can sneakily enter. Fear is more likely to undermine health than being alone is.</p>
