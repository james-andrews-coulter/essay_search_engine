        <h3>2Improving the instinct for endorsement</h3>
<p>Our sulking and our belief in intuitive understanding has its touching side, evoking the enormous faith that we place in our partner’s capacity to interpret us. But part of becoming an adult must be to believe that we cannot continue to expect others to read our minds if we have not previously laid out their contents through the (admittedly very cumbersome) medium of words. Even the most intelligent, sensitive lover cannot be expected to navigate around us without a lot of patiently articulated verbal indications of our desires and intentions.</p>
<p>Those charming early lucky guesses about what our lovers feel should not fool us for too long. Even in a very successful relationship, there is only a tiny amount that a lover should be expected to know of their beloved without it having been explained in language. We should not become furious when our lovers don’t guess right. Rather than bolting our mouths and retreating into a sulk, we should have the courage to try to explain; to teach them calmly.</p>
