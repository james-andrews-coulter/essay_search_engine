        <h2>Corner of Lexington Avenue and 44th Street</h2>
<p>It can be especially hard to magine that all thatnow exists will one day belong to history’. The opinions we espouse, the clothes we wear, the buildings we put up and the sort of relationships we have, all these will eventually be deemed to have belonged to a distinct historical period, whose identity cu rrently eludes easy recognition or summary. The present moment just feels fluid and boundless, incapable of being compressed into anything as restricted as an ‘era’. We glance down at other periods of history from our vantage point in the present but can’t imagine ourselves being wrapped up into anything as narrow as an ‘age’ in turn.
Our myopia has its costs. We miss being on the lookout for the particularities of our time. We don’t notice how precious everything is and how fragile and strange.
In early 1929, the photographer Walker Evans went around Manhattan shooting ordinary people having ordinary lunches in ordinary places. At the corner of Lexington Avenue and 44th Street, he came across a man (on the left in the picture) who thought he was just leaning forward to have another sip of milk, that drink of innocence, but who ended up entering history, just as surely as Napoleon or the Ming Emperor Zhu Changluo. We feel pained for the man at having to carry off this difficult double act; he didn’t even have a chance to finish his sandwich and he might have chosen another, less festive kind of headwear if he had known that he was being signed up for eternity. The figure next to him is comparably unprepared and oblivious, though he seems to have walked into history from another, earlier era, perhaps the 1890s or before the Flood. Even his food is distinctly historic, ag if he’d eschewed modern fare in favour of something more antediluvian like a ripper ord rabbit. As for the man on the right, doing his best to stay out of it. He has Pirations to appear ‘normal’ and ‘universal’ and steadily avoids our gaze while (maybe) doing a quiet burp. But he can’t escape time either. With his combed-back hair and steely, inscrutable eyes, we recognise him as a cousin of Charles de Gaulle or a nephew of Harold Macmillan. He, too, won’t be able to dawdle in the shapeless present forever; he, too, will have to join history.
None of Walker Evans’ characters could have known that they would eventually form a small part of a gigantic enterprise called ‘the early 20th century’, which would have its own colours, lights, associations and hats.
Knowing what will inevitably happen, we might at points go out and look around at the present day as if it were already on the way to being the past it will eventually be categorised as. We might choose any place, as humdrum and as accessible as possible the phone repair shop, the park, a restaurant, our kitchen and, without any need for a camera, attempt to perceive what might touch, delight and move our successors in a future that is slowly gathering pace offstage. We might, alongside our journeys through space, learn to become melancholy travellers through time.
many of us, a fundamental priority is that For uid neves ever end up in an asylum, or ut it pejoratively, a madhouse, ean bin or a place for crazies. We are for derstandable reasons deeply wedded to o ea of our sanity. And yet looked at more generously, ‘sanity’ is not an unassailable island with rigid or impregnable boundaries: it is a continent that is constantly suffused with waves of trouble, pain and confusion. A degree of mental perturbance belongs to health. A share of madness is, and should be, present in every good and sane life. Vincent Van Gogh entered the SaintPgul Asylum in Provence in May 1889 and was to remain there until May the following year. He had grown increasingly exhausted in the previous months, his mood veering between exultation and despair, visionary fervour and dejected self-loathing. At first, he spent a lot of time in bed sleeping, thinking and writing to his brother. Then gradually he felt well enough to paint and did so both in his room and in the grounds. He particularly loved the asylum’s gardens: its pine trees, caterpillars, butterflies and flowers (bluebells, dandelions and most famously irises). It was here that he painted some of his best-loved works; the Yan Gogh we know was reborn in this walled garden in Provence, . aoe wasn’t just a pretty spectacle, ice ee of the human capacity to nas a overcome appalling degrees of loss er ete This was G man who had thought oad ba, of killing himself only months ne nature, he found a stream of counterguments.

the id oe eee we break is that we do believe ae ah a Ow ourselves to bend. We auton aice. bonis but to keep going, recovery oti ne a so-called brave. But that we cannot = a. Mee Ce pe, that it has become too much and that the disturbances we have been warding off for too long have now got the better of us.
However alarming our state might be to those around us, we might almost be grateful for our collapse. A breakdown can be a prelude to a breakthrough. In the midst of our despair or mania, things may be rearranging themselves inside. We are, confusedly, expressing a longing for a new kind of life: a more caring relationship, a more authentic career path, a more compassionate acceptance of ourselves and our past.
One day, we might find ourselves in an asylum. We shouldn’t despair that this is where we have ended up. Many have been here before us and some of them understood life better than anyone. We should feel proud of how courageous we have been in admitting that we are defeated. At last we have an opportunity to cry, to think and to heal. We don’t need to do very much; we can lie in bed for hours and when we feel up to it, at our own pace, go out for a quiet wander among the pine trees. The old way wasn’t working; this is a new start.
When the sun comes out, we might finda comfortable bench from which to contemplate a medley of flowers with the sort of mystical delight, open-hearted joy and love for Ife known only to those who have, in their darkest moments, been tempted to give up entirely.</p>
