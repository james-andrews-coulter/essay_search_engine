            <h4>5. Freedom</h4>
<p>We value ‘freedom’ very highly in our society. Perhaps for the first time in history we speak of it as an absolute and unalienable right for every human being.
  Sometimes I think we see it as so obviously a good and necessary quality of life that we do not examine what we mean by it.</p>
<p>But it is not really that simple. In the first place freedom has two dimensions: there is ‘freedom from’ – from things you dislike, that bind or limit you (poverty, pain or
  fear, for example). And there is ‘freedom to’, which is, I think, the more important, the more joyful and the more enriching. It seems that the American Declaration of Independence was
  trying to draw this distinction between the two when it separated ‘liberty’ and ‘the pursuit of happiness’.</p>
<p>And it is this second dimension of freedom which has been associated with solitude – first to work out what you desire to be free to do, and then to imagine and create the doing of it. In
  The Stations of Solitude, the philosopher Alice Koller defined freedom as ‘Not only having no restraints, but also being self-governing according to laws of your own choosing . . .
  where your choices spring from a genuine sense of what your life is and can become.’ In this short passage she moves from ‘no restraints’ (freedom from) to being
  ‘self-governing’ (freedom to). In order to achieve this second sort of freedom she suggests that you need a ‘genuine sense of what your life is and can become’. That is to
  say, you need a consciousness of yourself, and we have already seen how solitude enhances and develops that self-awareness which is the first step towards being self-governing.</p>
<p>But it goes further than this. There is a very real sense in which the presence of other people limits our personal freedom. At the very crudest level most of us do not feel ‘free’
  to pick our noses or fart in company. A little further up the social scale, even in these libertarian times, many places of business still require workers to wear a uniform and most have an
  implicit, if not an explicit, ‘dress code’. Even party invitations suggest what you might want to wear – and most people find this helpful, even though it is of course a
  restriction. Even if you decide not to abide by the advice, your complete freedom to dress as you choose will have been compromised. On the whole, people in a group feel most comfortable when they
  are, broadly speaking, conforming to the behaviour of that group. When my ex-husband and I separated, our houses very quickly diverged in decor – while we lived together I did not feel
  consciously inhibited, but the first room I decorated in my own, single-person, household was a colour I would not even have thought of before. We did not fight about the colour of the walls, but I
  learned (and judging by his present house, he also learned) to pre-compromise when we came to make those kinds of choices. Now I know I like jewel-bright colours to live with. Being with each
  other, in this small and not very important way, restricted our personal freedoms. It is inevitable, and in any good relationship an acceptable price to pay, but we should not disguise from
  ourselves that there is a price.</p>
<p>Because there is another more profound sense in which being alone strengthens personal freedom. Assuming that you are a reasonably nice person, who finds it easier to feel happy and confident
  when those around you – and especially those you love – are happy, then some of your energy and imagination is bound to be (and should be) engaged in their happiness as well as your
  own. R. D. Laing, the radical psychiatrist, wrote a little monologue to show the way in which love itself – desiring the good of the beloved other – can make personal choice and freedom
  extremely complex. Here the ‘speaker’ (a fictional voice) wants to be happy but sees that those around her are not:</p>
<p>They are not having fun.</p>
<p>I can’t have fun if they don’t.</p>
<p>If I can’t get them to have fun, then I can’t have fun with them.</p>
<p>Getting them to have fun is not fun. It is hard work.</p>
<p>I might get fun out of finding out why they’re not having fun.</p>
<p>I am not supposed to get fun out of working out why they’re not.</p>
<p>In fact this sense of knowing yourself alone and nakedly, so to speak, may be one part of why solitude inspires creativity – because creating something yourself, of your
  own, uniquely, requires a kind of personal freedom, a lack of inhibition, a capacity not to glance over your shoulder at the opinions of others.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is oddly the case that life with others seems to work more smoothly when individuals do know what they want, even if they are prepared to compromise it for the greater collective
  enjoyment. Nothing is more destructive of warm relations than the person who endlessly ‘doesn’t mind’. They do not seem to be a full individual if they have nothing of their own
  to ‘bring to the table’, so to speak. This suggests that even those who know that they are best and most fully themselves in relationships (of whatever kind), need a capacity to be
  alone, and probably at least some occasions to use that ability. If you know who you are and know that you are relating to others because you want to, rather than because you are trapped (unfree),
  in desperate need and greed, because you fear you will not exist without someone to affirm that fact, then you are free. Some solitude can in fact create better relationships, because they will be
  freer ones.</p>
<p>Here is Alice Koller again, summing up these points:</p>
<p>Being solitary is being alone well: being alone luxuriously immersed in doings of your own choice, aware of the fullness of your own presence rather than of the absence of
      others. Because solitude is an achievement.</p>
