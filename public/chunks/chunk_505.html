        <h2>Squeaky Hinges</h2>
<p>In Laurence Sterne’s great novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (the first parts of which were published in 1759), there’s an episode in which one of the characters reveals that in his house, there’s a squeaky door hinge that has annoyed him for over ten years. That’s rather a long time to leave a hinge unattended, given that it would take only a minute with some oil to correct the problem. Yet we all have such hinges in our lives.</p>
<p>Joshua Reynolds, Laurence Sterne, 1760</p>
<p>It’s a theme of great pathos: we are plagued by minor irritants that we don’t get around to sorting out. We neglect to replace a light bulb, we don’t refill the windscreen wiper fluid, a button is left hanging by a thread, we don’t repaint a wall.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that we are snobs about happiness: the issue is so small, and yet we operate with a sense that our contentment must be made up of enormous and prestigious elements (more money, a bigger house, a grand job). We leave the hinge or the button unattended because we can’t imagine that our moods could be hostage to such trivial features.</p>
<p>But generously considered, a lot of how we feel is in fact determined by ‘minor things’. We insist on a heroic view of our lives, in which great transformations are all that matter, and neglect how much – cumulatively – the small things add up.</p>
<p>‘Small things’ include not just household items, but also minor dynamics in our relationships with ourselves and others. For half a lifetime, we may neglect to discuss with a partner how their way of alluding to our mother irritates us or how much we would prefer them not to cut bread a certain way. We may spend decades avoiding a certain kind of introspection or moment of self-knowledge. We are heedless in the way we plan for happiness. The tasks we need to take on include not just the large prestigious ones around status and work; we should focus on a fair number of squeaky hinges too.</p>
