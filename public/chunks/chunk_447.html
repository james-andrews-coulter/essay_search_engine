        <h2>A Utopian Commune</h2>
<p>Modern society tends to offer us two models for our living arrangements: we can either be alone or with a romantic partner. The drawbacks of both options are well known. The first has a habit of leaving us feeling abandoned, the second stifled and restless. We’re in danger of either longing for company or wishing that we weren’t stuck expecting one other person to fulfil all our emotional and practical needs – and, with even the best intentions, generally failing to do so.</p>
<p>When life is going well enough in other areas, the frustrations are almost bearable. But when everything has been lost, desperation may inspire us to try to find something that can shore us up. This is when an unfamiliar option may start to sound oddly appealing: to live communally in close proximity to other people who have failed.</p>
<p>A community of failed people promises to solve the problems of both loneliness and judgement. In such a place, we will be surrounded by others, but others who will not moralise, sneer or cut us dead. We will be in a ‘family’ bonded by a vital glue: our joint experience of condemnation and shame.</p>
<p>The failure doesn’t have to be identical. Maybe one person ran off with some money, another was in a sex scandal and a third lost their job because of their problem with anxiety. What will unite this diverse set of characters is that they all know the toll of having to live in a society where, even if they don’t mean to, others constantly enforce the message that they are strange, rare, pitiable or devilish.</p>
<p>In an ideal community of the failed, life would feel lighter and more liberated because there would be no need to interact with harsh witnesses every day. Chores and routine tasks could be shared out in common: there would be failed people doing the cooking and failed people taking care of the laundry; failed people tending to the vegetable garden and failed people repairing the roof after a storm. It might take place in a simple but beautiful house somewhere out in nature, very far from other people, with the ability to live cheaply and self-sufficiently.</p>
<p>One could hope for an atmosphere of vivid kindness, because everyone in the group would be so familiar with the ravages of self-disgust. Members would encourage one another to keep going, not to lapse into despair and to have faith that black moods will pass. There would be moments of joint confession and atonement.</p>
<p>Collectively, we’ve been good at dreaming up where cheerful, beautiful people should go. Resorts the world over lend a sense of community to buoyant families and ardent lovers. We know, too, how to lock up people in terrifying prisons and throw away the keys. What we haven’t yet found our way to is the building of communities for people who have failed – for those who have surrendered their pride, who are no longer interested in one-upmanship, who are profoundly aware of their flaws and are committed to battling them … a community of those who recognise that the kindness of others stands as the central reason to remain alive.</p>
<p>In this community, we would not be able to erase our failures, but we would be able to attenuate a great many of their secondary, aggravating characteristics. We would have ruined our lives without losing all experience of kindness and companionship.</p>
