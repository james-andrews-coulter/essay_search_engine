        <h3>Good listeners keep listening</h3>
<p>A standard rule of conversation suggests that when one person says something, we should come back with an anecdote of our own that matches what has just been shared. A friend complains about their boss, so we complain about ours; a colleague had a blocked drain at home, so did our sister.</p>
<p>But with a partner we need to put this social convention firmly to one side. They don’t need us to match or top their problem. They just want us to acknowledge the unique, particular nature of their troubles. Instead of interrupting and diverting, we should perpetually go in for encouragement; we should in effect always be saying: ‘Tell me more.’</p>
