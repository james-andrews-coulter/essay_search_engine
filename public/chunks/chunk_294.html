        <h2>I. The Problem</h2>
<p>Digital addiction is an omnipresent contemporary problem, and the literature about its effects on our selves and brains is large and growing. I have found several books about it informative and useful:</p>
<p>The Shallows: How the Internet Is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember by Nicholas Carr is an impassioned disquisition on the profound (and in his view mostly negative) impact of the internet on our minds and brains – our capacity to think, read and store experiences in long-term memory. Carr is a writer about technology, and this is no Luddite tract; but his arguments are personally felt and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Mind Change: How Digital Technologies are Leaving Their Mark on Our Brains by the neuroscientist Susan Greenfield also tackles the effects of pervasive technological change on our brains, identities and relationships. It’s very accessible, and leavened with some personal examples and anecdotes.</p>
<p>Richard Restak’s The New Brain: How the Modern Age is Rewiring Your Mind is another neurologist’s take on digital overuse and the speeding up of our lives, and is particularly good on the effects of multitasking and the impact of digital technologies on young brains – and therefore, on the next generation’s. It is accessible and clear.</p>
<p>Renata Salecl’s The Tyranny of Choice is a short, reader-friendly book on the anxieties induced by the illusion of free choice, and by the idea that we can change our identities and lives for the better by following a few tips on how to do so. The ideology of choice, Salecl argues, is at the centre of the consumerist society, and it breeds the idea that we can shop for ourselves as well – and diverts us from struggling with more serious social issues. Salecl’s argument is somewhat ideologically loaded, but worth listening to.</p>
<p>Why Love Hurts by Eva Illouz is an original and incisive study of how the wide-ranging availability of potential partners, and of sexual choice, has lessened the incentive to commitment among men. Illouz is particularly good on the historical shifts in relations between men and women, and the changes wrought by the sexual revolution.</p>
