            <h3>¶ History is Now</h3>
<p>It can be hard to imagine how we might change the status quo. Much that is around us conspires to give off a sense of fixity. We are surrounded by institutions and habits that have lasted for centuries. We trust that the human beings who came before us have fully mapped the range of the possible. If something hasn’t happened, it’s either because it can’t happen or it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>When we study History, however, the picture changes sharply. Once time is speeded up and we climb up a mountain of minutes to survey the centuries, change appears constant. New continents are discovered; alternative ways of governing nations are pioneered; ideas of how to dress and whom to worship are transformed. Once people wore strange cloaks and tilled the land with clumsy instruments. A long time ago, they chopped a king’s head off. Way back, people got around in fragile ships, ate the eyeballs of sheep, used chamber pots and didn’t know how to fix teeth.</p>
<p>We come away from all this knowing, in theory at least, that things do change. However, in practice, and almost without noticing, we tend to distance ourselves and our own societies from a day-to-day belief that we belong to the same ongoing turbulent narrative and are, at present, its central actors. History, we feel, is what used to happen; it can’t really be what is happening around us in the here and now. In our vicinity at least, things have settled down.</p>
<p>To attenuate this insensitivity to the omnipresence of change and, by extension, the passivity it breeds, we might turn to some striking lines in T.S. Eliot’s cycle of poems, Four Quartets (1943):</p>
<p>So, while the light fails</p>
<p>On a winter’s afternoon, in a secluded chapel</p>
<p>History is now and England.</p>
<p>Winter afternoons, around 4pm, have a habit of feeling particularly resolved and established, especially in quiet English country chapels, many of which date back to the Middle Ages. Hence the surprise of Eliot’s third line, his resonant: ‘History is now and England’. In other words, everything that we associate with history – the impetuous daring of great people, the dramatic alterations in values, the revolutionary questioning of long-held beliefs, the upturning of the old order – is still going on, even at this very moment, in outwardly peaceful, apparently unchanging places like the countryside near Shamley Green in Surrey, where Eliot wrote the poem. We don’t see it only because we are standing far too close to it. The world is being made and remade at every instant. Any one of us has a theoretical chance of being an agent in history, on a big or small scale. It is open to our own times to build a new city as beautiful as Venice, to change ideas as radically as the Renaissance, to start an intellectual movement as resounding as Buddhism.</p>
<p>The present has all the contingency of the past – and is every bit as malleable. It should not intimidate us. How we love, travel, approach the arts, govern, educate ourselves, run businesses, age and die are all up for further development. Current views may appear firm, but only because we exaggerate their fixity. The majority of what exists is arbitrary, neither inevitable nor right, simply the result of muddle and happenstance. We should be confident, even at sunset on winter afternoons, of our power to join the stream of history – and, however modestly, change its course.</p>
