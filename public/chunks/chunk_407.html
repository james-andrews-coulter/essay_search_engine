            <h2>Should I Kill Myself?</h2>
<p>The question sounds so shocking that even in the depths of misery we are rarely inclined to address it head on – not least because we are given every encouragement by respectable societal voices to chase it aggressively out of our minds. It can seem as if only the severely unwell would ever seriously contemplate, let alone carry out, such a desperate act.</p>
<p>However, we do ourselves and our lives a serious injustice through evasiveness. We should accept suicide as the real possibility it is – or else it will return as a compulsion in moments of particular despair. The question of existing or not existing deserves dignified and slow examination. People will turn to suicide whether or not the matter is taboo; there can be no risk of incitement through discussion alone, but at least when we have the courage to examine the act rationally, we can develop a better handle on the central intellectual arguments for remaining on the side of life – rather than aligning with it only out of shame, habit, convention or cowardice. A good life requires that we wrestle sincerely with the possibility that we might end it prematurely. Living should be a choice, not a command – and, especially in the wake of serious failure, we need to choose with our eyes open. If we are properly to respect life, we should never be squeamish about dallying for a while – a long and thoughtful while – with the notion that we do not have to be here.</p>
<p>To liberate our thinking, we might start by looking back to the Stoic thinkers of ancient Greece and Rome, among them Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes. In different ways, these philosophers put forward the view that choosing our own end could be a realistic possibility that a self-possessed and intelligent person might opt for after a great deal of reflection, not just a momentary aberration or evidence of mental illness. Exceptionally in the history of the West, the Stoics held that there was nothing inherently shocking or forbidden about ending one’s own life. It was, in their eyes, the birthright of every noble and free spirit to choose how long they wished to be here.</p>
<p>For the Stoics, contentment – or as they put it in Latin, dignitas – must be founded on a life in which our bodies and minds leave us free of terrible pain, in which outer circumstances do not continually humiliate us and in which mistakes or ‘tragic errors’ (the Stoics were keen observers of Greek tragedy) do not bring eternal opprobrium and shame upon us.</p>
<p>The Stoics knew we were in danger, however. Our capacity to ensure a pain-free life endowed with dignitas is vulnerable to many forces not wholly within our command: we have little say in the condition of our bodies and brains, the minds of others can quickly fill with unbudgeable prejudices about us and we have passions and tendencies to foolishness that mean we may well unwittingly do something that falls foul of our community’s moral code. The term that the Stoics used to capture this vast, uncontrollable inner and outer terrain was ‘fortune’. And, as they insisted, key elements of what we require to lead a decent life lie in the realm of fickle and cruel fortune.</p>
<p>The essential objective of Stoic philosophy is to help us reach a position where we are not held hostage or intimidated by fortune’s possible whims and vagaries. When we worry, it is common to be told that our dreadful fear won’t turn into a reality. But what if it does? We might, in the dark hours, throw out a comment to ourselves that, as soon as we’ve uttered it, sounds both completely alien and very soothing: ‘If things were to get really bad, truly bad – more than I would want to bear – it wouldn’t have to go on forever.’</p>
<p>This middle-of-the-night thought is also likely to sound grotesque, outlawed and embarrassing, because we are all – even atheists – the heirs of 2,000 years of emphasis on the sanctity of every life, and of a faith in a benevolent God who assures each one of us of His love right now and His peace in eternity. But the Stoics made it their starting point. Consider this letter Seneca wrote to a friend, sometime around AD 60:</p>
<p>The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can … He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are numerous events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he sets himself free. And this privilege is his, not only when the crisis is upon him, but as soon as Fortune seems to be maltreating him; then he looks about carefully and sees whether he ought, or ought not, to end his life on that account. He holds that it makes no difference to him whether his taking-off be natural or self-inflicted, whether it comes later or earlier. He does not regard it with fear, as if it were a great loss; for no man can lose very much when but a driblet remains. It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. And dying well means escape from the danger of living ill.</p>
<p>Seneca was not advocating random or thoughtless exits; he was attempting to give us more courage in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always within our power, when we have genuinely tried everything and rationally had enough, to choose a noble path out of our troubles. He was seeking to strip willed death of its associations with pathology and to render it instead an option that the wise always know is there as a backstop. It doesn’t need to be a grim spectre, either; the Stoics emphasised that death could be a moment to celebrate what had gone well in a life, to thank friends and to appreciate the beautiful and good sides of the world. The idea was to see death as a door through which we knew we had the right and the capacity to walk when it felt necessary. Seneca continued:</p>
<p>You can find men who have gone so far as to profess wisdom and yet maintain that one should not offer violence to one’s own life, and hold it accursed for a man to be the means of his own destruction; we should wait, say they, for the end decreed by nature. But one who says this does not see that he is shutting off the path to freedom. The best thing which eternal law ever ordained was that it allowed to us one entrance into life, but many exits. Must I await the cruelty either of disease or of man, when I can depart through the midst of torture, and shake off my troubles? This is the one reason why we cannot complain of life; it keeps no one against his will. Humanity is well situated, because no man is unhappy except by his own fault. Live, if you so desire; if not, you may return to the place whence you came … If you would pierce your heart, a gaping wound is not necessary – a lancet will open the way to that great freedom, and tranquillity can be purchased at the cost of a pin-prick.</p>
<p>These ideas sound so alien to us because of the long Christian past that succeeded pagan philosophy – and that deemed suicide a sin greater than murder and a direct offence against God, because it involved killing not only the body but also the soul. Many of us continue to hold on to the Christian views of the end of life even while we don’t actually believe in their underlying rationale – and indeed, when we are far closer to the pagans in our pitiless and harsh exposure to fortune. That is precisely why, in order to cope with the anxieties fortune causes us, we should permit ourselves to learn more about a stiffer, franker philosophy than our own. Some of the Stoic philosophers were among the most intelligent, kindly, wise and gentle people who have ever lived. However strange and unfamiliar some of their views may sound, we would do well to extend sympathy to why they held them – and what relief they would have found in them on their most challenging days.</p>
<p>That said, our claim is that there remain three central reasons why suicide is not – after all – to be advised. We can list them systematically.</p>
