        <h3>1. When we have given up on perfection</h3>
<p>When we recognise that we are a flawed species and that whomever one got together with would be radically imperfect in a host of deeply serious ways. One must conclusively kill the idea that things would be ideal with any creature in this galaxy. There can only ever be a ‘good-enough’ relationship.</p>
<p>For this realisation to sink in, it helps to have had a number of relationships before settling down, not in order to have the chance to locate ‘the right person’, but so that one can have ample opportunity to discover at first hand, in many different contexts, the truth that everyone (even the most initially exciting prospect) really is a bit wrong close up.</p>
