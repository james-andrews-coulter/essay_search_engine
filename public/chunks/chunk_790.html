        <h2>THE BREAKDOWN</h2>
<p>If we are extremely lucky, a breakdown does not need to be merely the end. We will be failing in certain eyes of course, we will be letting down a lot of people and dashing the hopes of those who need us to perform in a certain way.</p>
<p>But if accompanied by the right sort of care, a breakdown can allow us to review the role that work was playing in our lives and to cease using it as compensation for an emotional wound. We can see that the real tragedy isn’t that we messed up our impressive careers but that we so badly needed to have them in the first place in order to make up for early and unexplored deprivation.</p>
<p>Our failure may have stripped us of chances to impress in the worldly sense. At a stroke, though, we’ll be liberated from those false friends and colleagues who pegged their attention to our money and status. And all we will have to fall back on are those who understand love and are willing to be concerned with us not because of anything we can do for them, but simply because we are alive. This may be the first time we have ever witnessed such unconditionality—and it will correct a lingering misapprehension that we can only earn care through performance.</p>
<p>The breakdown will offer us a path toward a more authentic way of living, where who we really are, shorn of our trappings, can feel acceptable. The failure we always dreaded would happen has unfolded and we are liberated, no longer having to worry about it as a feared spectre.</p>
<p>In the ruins, we may be able to ask ourselves new questions: What do I actually want to do? Whose opinion do I really care about? We’ll have slain the dragon of prestige and may now be ready to live on our own terms for the first time.</p>
