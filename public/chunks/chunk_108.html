            <h3>¶ News</h3>
<p>It doesn’t come with any instructions, because it’s meant to be the most normal, easy, obvious and unremarkable activity in the world, like breathing or blinking. After an interval, usually no longer than a night (and often far less; if we’re feeling particularly restless, we might only manage to go for five minutes before our resolve breaks), we interrupt whatever we are doing in order to check the news. We put our lives on hold in the expectation of receiving yet another dose of critical information about all the most significant achievements, catastrophes, crimes, epidemics and romantic complications to have befallen humankind around the planet since we last had a look.</p>
<p>Societies become modern, the philosopher Hegel suggested, when news replaces religion as our central source of guidance and our touchstone of moral authority. In the developed economies, the news now occupies a position of power at least equal to that formerly enjoyed by the faiths. News dispatches track the canonical hours with uncanny precision: matins have been transubstantiated into the breakfast bulletin, vespers into the evening report. But the news doesn’t just follow a quasi-religious timetable. It also demands of us that we approach it with some of the same deferential expectations we would once have harboured of our faiths. Here, too, we hope to receive revelations, learn who is good and bad, fathom suffering and understand the unfolding logic of existence. Here too, if we refuse to take part in the rituals, there could be imputations of heresy.</p>
<p>For most of history, ‘news’ was for the few. It comprised hugely expensive information designed to help kings and queens manage their lands. There was a practical purpose behind the need to know.</p>
<p>Today, news is still sold to us on the basis that it is information vital for our lives. The presumption is that we need to know a great deal about disasters pretty much anywhere in the world, about the doings of the rich and famous and about what’s been going on in the last few hours at the top levels of government. In consequence, we get a chaotic and deeply distorted picture of a world composed of crises, violence and celebrity parties – and we are continuously pulled away from our own priorities and attempts to focus on the management of our lives.</p>
<p>In the Utopia, news would be much more ambitious. Outlets would compete to provide the information we needed to help us to live and die well, but didn’t yet possess. This might include bulletins on what had just happened or it might include things that had happened long ago. These would be defined as ‘news’ because the story hadn’t yet reached our ears. We might not have heard that Socrates had unravelled the mystery of love or that Emile Durkheim had worked out why we get more stressed as societies become more prosperous – even though these discoveries were made long ago – just as the invention of writing would have been ‘news’ to a Pictish warrior many centuries after it was common knowledge to the bureaucrats of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>To succeed commercially, truly helpful news needs to be seductive, artful and entertaining; it can’t just be earnest. In the ideal future, news might still have a tabloid style – attention- grabbing, brief, entertaining and making an undisguised appeal to our sensual appetites – only this style would be in the service of a more accurate assessment of what we actually need to know in order to be wise.</p>
