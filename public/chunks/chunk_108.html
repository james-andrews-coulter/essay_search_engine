        <h1>3. Vulnerability; or, Adversity in the Body</h1>
<p>I am sometimes struck, when teaching my students, by our good fortune. Here we are, able to spend two hours thinking about some problem in philosophy – say, the nature
  and meaning of religious faith, or the relationship between comedy and tragedy, or what we understand by the concept of a human being. One of the major reasons we can do this is because we are in
  good health – we are not troubled by our body in such a way as to make prolonged reflection and discussion difficult or even impossible. Of course, there are sometimes students who are
  suffering from some illness, more or less serious, and they are admirable in their determination to continue to study. But they represent the exception. And the fact remains that, for most of the
  history of humanity, most people were not generally in a state of health good enough to leave their mind free to reflect on the kinds of things that occupy my students and me in our lessons. On the
  contrary, ill health and sickness dogged people’s lives in a way that, fortunately, is much less common in the developed world – though there are, of course, plenty of people elsewhere
  in the world who are not so lucky.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, illness has not been wholly eradicated from the human world, and it never will be. And in illness we realize how fragile and vulnerable the body is, how much we accept good health
  as if it were the norm when, in fact, it is more a matter of good fortune than anything we have by right. In illness, we have to face our essential weakness: the adversity of the body. In this
  chapter, I propose to reflect on some ways in which we might do that.</p>
<p>Montaigne and the Vulnerability of the Body</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life, Montaigne suffered from kidney stones, to which he had inherited a propensity from his father. Kidney stones are caused by a build-up of calcium or
  other minerals in the body, creating spiked or jagged crystals, like fragments of shattered glass. They can cause extraordinarily acute pain, not only in the abdomen but also in the ureter as they
  pass into the bladder; the sensation is like being burnt on the inside. These days they can be treated, but in Montaigne’s day all one could hope to do was pass them out in the urine, itself
  an intensely painful experience. Indeed, in Montaigne’s time kidney stones carried a risk of death through infection, and it is said that the pain was by itself intense enough to lead some
  sufferers to contemplate suicide.</p>
<p>In his Essays Montaigne speaks from time to time about his kidney stones, and some of the most revealing and moving passages are to be found in the very last essay, ‘On
  Experience’, in which he traces out some of the ways in which he sought to cope with the illness. But the essay is more than that: it is also a plea for the body, for its needs and its
  legitimacy, an entreaty that we accept it, together with the strange demands it makes upon us. There is in all of Montaigne’s writings a calm acceptance of the body, a sense of its
  loveliness, even as it is vulnerable to illness. He wants us to see that, whilst our physical vulnerability makes us liable to illness, it also opens us up to physical pleasure and delight. Hence,
  he speaks in generous terms of our need to eat, drink and sleep, encouraging us to enjoy these things for, after all, we have no choice but to follow their demands, and he even tells us that he
  likes scratching himself, particularly his ear, he says, which often gets itchy.</p>
<p>Montaigne believed that sixteenth-century France was too suspicious of pleasure, and I doubt that he would have thought the modern world any different: what we so readily take for pleasure he
  would have seen as the miserable pursuit of empty satisfaction, the expression of an unavowed wretchedness which makes our pursuit of pleasure desperate even as it makes it unobtainable. He would
  say that our very insistence on pleasure in the modern age is a sign that something is wrong, that what we want is not so much pleasure as self-forgetfulness – the abandonment of all thought
  and judgement in a miserable carnival of intoxication. The synecdoche of this is the contemporary attitude towards erotic desire, in which sex is less about pleasure and more about a kind of
  desperate longing to escape ourselves in an abandonment to, and of, the senses so intense that it puts an end to all future pleasure, as if we could disburden ourselves of the demands of the body
  at one fell swoop and be liberated forever from its demands. Our hubris prevents our getting what we truly want, in part because it stops us asking what it is we truly want. Our age is, in
  its own way, as far away as was Montaigne’s from accepting his advice neither to flee from pleasures nor to chase after them.</p>
<p>Given Montaigne’s generous understanding of the body, it is not surprising that he has some things to say about being ill on which it is worth meditating. His final essay is a kind of
  therapy of illness. So, for example, he tells us that in confronting his own illness – not just kidney stones, though he was certainly thinking about them too – he sought neither to
  fight it relentlessly nor to give in to it weakly, but to allow it its place, according to its nature and his own. We must, he says, ‘submit gently to the laws of our condition. We exist in
  order to get old and weak, to fall ill, despite what medicine offers’ (‘De l’experience’: 299). He counsels us that we should not complain if something happens to
  us that could happen to anyone, and reminds us that, whilst we can often look on the illness and pain of others with equanimity, we complain bitterly when we experience the same things. There is in
  Montaigne a kind of solidarity with others which encourages us to recognize that we are nothing special as individuals – that what happens to others can happen to us, and that that is just
  the way things are.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, Montaigne explicitly lists the things that have helped him cope with the illness caused by his kidney stones: he recognizes it as simply part of growing old; he sees
  that many of the men he most respects have the same disease, and he is honoured by being in their company; he is grateful that illness has come to him late in life, since he was free to enjoy his
  youth; and he takes delight in being praised by others for his fortitude in the face of his illness. He also points out that, in the past, some people called down upon themselves various illnesses
  as part of the practice of asceticism, in the belief that to do so promoted virtue. He would never do this, he says – but the illness that has come unbidden is teaching him this lesson, for
  which he can thus be grateful. Further, he grants that, although his kidney stones might precipitate his death, so might any number of other illnesses that he happens not to have; and lastly he
  says that the illness is weaning him from life, allowing him to face his own inevitable death with greater equanimity. And in an extraordinarily striking turn of phrase, he ends this part of his
  reflections thus: ‘You are not dying because you are ill; you are dying because you are alive. Death kills you perfectly well without the aid of illness’ (‘De
  l’experience’: 302).</p>
<p>In his study, Montaigne had inscribed on the beams quotations from some of his favourite classical authors. He wanted to be forever reminded of the wisdom they offered in the
      face of adversity.</p>
<p>There is in Montaigne’s reflections a massive sense of reality, a capacity to grasp experience directly and for himself that is rare. He is able to see clearly what is happening to him and
  at the same time find consolation in his agony, without self-deception. And he is able to turn his suffering to account, to put it to use. Moreover, he helps us see that the way one thinks of
  one’s body is not fixed; we have a certain flexibility here, a capacity to conceptualize, to imagine and to experience the body in new ways.</p>
<p>Very few of us, I think, possess as clear a sense of ourselves and our reality as Montaigne did. Certainly this is true in my own case. Some little while ago I was ill. It was nothing serious
  – mainly I was rather run down, but I also had heart palpitations and some problems with my eyes. I had a series of tests with my GP and at the hospital, but no underlying or fundamental
  problem was discovered. Nonetheless, the symptoms continued to get worse – dizziness, pins and needles and so on. At about this time, I was fortunate to be able to spend a few months in
  Italy. The moment I arrived, my symptoms disappeared: the change of climate and lifestyle snapped me out of my routines and broke the cycle of the illness. It was immediately evident to me that
  what had really been making me ill was my anxiety about being ill. I had been ill to start with, but somehow an anxiety about being ill had got hold of me, and I continued to be ill simply from the
  thought that I was ill. But I am sure that, had I been able to learn from Montaigne, my symptoms would have disappeared long before I went to Italy. This experience was all the more striking in
  that I am not given to hypochondria in general. I know that what I experienced is quite common: we all – most of us, anyway – can make an illness worse by not seeing it as merely part
  of the flow of life, by reaching out too quickly to rid ourselves of it, by fretting about it. This is not to say we should not seek medical help if we need it. But it is to say that we ought, like
  Montaigne, to try to be realistic about the vulnerability of our body. Ironically, accepting your weakness can make you strong.</p>
<p>A Narrative of Illness: the Possibility of Gratitude</p>
<p>Some of the points I made about how we think of the body are well articulated – though not in the context of Montaigne, whom he does not mention – by Arthur W. Frank
  in his helpful book The Wounded Storyteller. Frank explores some of the ways in which we can give a narrative of illness – that is, think about it, give an account of it,
  tell a story about it. And, in Frank’s terms, Montaigne construes the narrative of his illness as a quest. Such quest narratives, he says, ‘meet suffering head on; they accept illness
  and seek to use it’ (The Wounded Storyteller: 115).</p>
<p>John Updike, who had a lifelong battle with extreme psoriasis, also exemplifies this kind of narrative. Having sought relief from his illness for many years by massive exposure to the sun in
  summer, he was eventually able to find help in a new form of treatment in the 1970s known as PUVA, a kind of UVA light therapy. And yet, once ‘clear’, he wondered whether there was not,
  after all, an intimate connection between his skin condition and his abilities and resilience as a writer. ‘Only psoriasis,’ he writes, ‘could have taken a very average little boy
  . . . and made him into a . . . writer. What was my creativity . . . but a parody of my skin’s embarrassing overproduction? Was not my thick literary skin . . . a superior version of my poor
  vulnerable own . . .?’ (‘At War with My Skin’: 75).</p>
<p>Updike expresses here the capacity to turn illness to account – though it is only in retrospect that he sees himself as having done this. Moreover, he displays a very
  under-acknowledged ability to show gratitude for illness, an ability to remind himself that it is possible to be grateful for that which hurts us, because it can make us into more than we would
  have been without it. No doubt Updike would have taken the treatment for his psoriasis much sooner in his life, had it been available. But what he makes us acknowledge is that a cure for illness is
  not always something that we have good reason to want. This is not, of course, a way of saying that illness is (or some illnesses are) good; it is, rather, a way of reminding us that we can each
  ask for ourselves what we truly and deeply want and need in life, and that the removal of illness (as with other adversities) might well, in some cases at least, make getting closer to that more
  difficult.</p>
<p>We should all try to do what Updike did and think about whether the things we want to rid ourselves of are not part of what makes our lives worthwhile. If you want to be in perfect health all
  the time, and you get what you want, it might make you complacent and self-satisfied. It might make you insensitive and uncaring to others. Or it might mean that your life lacks the kind of
  ‘edge’ which can help you see the world from an individual perspective and hence be related to things in a more productive, more intense way. Illness is not always a bad thing, and it
  is not always to be feared.</p>
<p>Further Narratives of Illness: Triumph and Silence</p>
<p>The two other types of illness narrative that Frank mentions are what he calls ‘the restitution narrative’ and ‘the chaos narrative’.</p>
<p>The former is a kind of story in which illness is construed as a temporary hiatus or deviation in the narrative of a life, after which life returns to ‘normal’ – that is, to
  its state before the illness, a state of health. This is, as Frank points out, the dominant narrative in the modern West, encouraged by the extraordinary growth in the powers of medical science. He
  points out that one of the disadvantages of this kind of narrative is that it can be triumphalist, as if all illness were curable; another is that it helps us conceal from ourselves the reality of
  death: each illness, even a terminal one, is broken down into a series of manageable and treatable maladies, helping us to evade the truth of our mortality. He describes the death of his
  mother-in-law in this way:</p>
<p>When my mother-in-law, Laura Foote, was dying from cancer, we all knew she was dying. At least one reason why our family never talked about her dying was that until two days
      before she died we remained fixed on the incremental remedies that medicine continued to offer. However clear her deterioration, there was always another treatment to offer. As long as small
      puzzles could be solved, fixing this or medicating that, the big issue of mortality was evaded. Each specialist carried out his task with some success, and the patient died. (The Wounded
      Storyteller: 84)</p>
<p>The latter narrative, the chaos narrative, is no real kind of narrative, because the person is suffering so deeply that there is no perspective that he or she can get
  on the pain, in order to put it into a story. As Frank mentions, the capacity to speak about one’s suffering always put one at some distance from its source, and can help one to cope with it.
  The deepest forms of suffering are in this sense silent. This reminds us of something we know, but often forget, namely that much human suffering is nothing more than unmitigated pain, pointless
  torment. We should all, perhaps particularly those who are thinking or writing about making sense of illness and bodily fragility, seek to bear this in mind, in order not to lose sight of the real
  nature of our own and others’ suffering.</p>
<p>How Do You Think Of Your Body?</p>
<p>To accompany these narratives, Frank offers different ways in which one can experience the body. Firstly there is the disciplined body, in which one thinks of
  one’s body as something one possesses and needs to regulate, as one does a machine. Then there is the mirroring body, which is conceived of in the light of, and is modelled on, an
  ideal image. Thirdly there is the dominating body, which exists as a force against others, through which, say, anger is expressed by venting itself on them. Then there is the
  communicative body, through which one fully accepts contingency, that is, the sense that one exists in a kind of dynamic relation with the external world and that the boundaries between
  body and world are unclear and fluid. This notion of the communicative body may seem strange, but the best example is Montaigne’s attitude to his body – his willingness to see illness
  as part of the flow of nature through him, and his capacity to find a sense of solidarity with those who suffer, or might suffer, just what he suffers.</p>
<p>Of course, we all think of our bodies in all four of these ways, and often at the same time, to different degrees and depending on the context. But, as I said earlier, what Frank’s
  conceptual scheme and Montaigne’s reflections alike help us see is that we can think of our bodies in different ways. When faced with an illness one can, with luck and perseverance, meditate
  on it and on one’s body as Montaigne did, and this might help us to see things somewhat differently and more productively.</p>
<p>The Need to Find Meaning in Illness</p>
<p>When I said that Montaigne had a massive sense of reality, I was thinking of him in the light of a point that Nietzsche makes when he says that it is not suffering that human
  beings cannot bear, but meaningless suffering. Of course, Montaigne was seeking to find meaning in his illness, but we can sense that the meaning he sought was firmly rooted in the reality of his
  situation. This is so, even though he was clearly stylizing himself in his illness, that is, seeking to create a perspective on his illness that would see it in noble, grand or similar terms.</p>
<p>One of the characters in Max Blecher’s great novel of sickness, Scarred Hearts, echoes Montaigne’s view of illness when he says that it can make of one a kind of deeply
  ironic hero. It may even be that Blecher, who suffered from tuberculosis of the spine, saw himself in this way. The novel is set in a sanatorium, and the character in question, Quintonce,
  is speaking with a fellow sufferer about his condition, and about the condition of all those in the institution. He claims that every hero, in order to achieve his goal, needs both energy and
  willpower.</p>
<p>Well, every invalid displays these. In the space of one year, an invalid expends exactly the same amount of energy and willpower one would need to conquer an empire . . .
      Except only that he consumes it in pure loss. That is why invalids could be called the most negative of heroes. Each one of us is “the one who wasn’t Caesar”, even though he
      has fulfilled all the conditions necessary for being one . . . To be possessed of all the component elements of a Caesar and yet to be . . . an invalid. It is a surprisingly ironic form of
      heroism. (Scarred Hearts: 84)</p>
<p>I am sure that Montaigne would have appreciated the faintly absurd, self-deprecating but also self-valorizing notion of the ill person – in this case, an invalid –
  as an ironic hero. He would have taken delight in the idea’s strange, indeed absurd, combination of domestic insignificance and worldly grandeur. It would have made him laugh.</p>
<p>Max Blecher, an ironic hero, with his mother.</p>
<p>Updike, whom I mentioned earlier, provides another, altogether more earnest way of finding meaning in illness, prior to his more successful treatment for psoriasis. Reflecting on the hours he
  spent lying in the sun on the beach, seeking relief from his condition, he writes that he always associated this with a kind of forgiveness from God, which was, for him, ‘a tactile actuality
  as I lay . . . under the . . . tropical sun. And the sun’s weight on my skin always meant this to me: I was being redeemed, hauled back into mankind . . . from deformity and shame’
  (‘At War with My Skin’: 68).</p>
<p>For Updike, the meaning of his illness was irreducibly religious, because he saw it in categories that he saw as religious: shame, and redemption through forgiveness. It was this, in part, which
  enabled him to cope with it: his psoriasis was not simply a form of physical discomfort; it was also, and perhaps more importantly, a kind of connection with God, mediated by the physical world
  – and thus a special kind of connection with that world. He found meaning in the illness through the meaning he found in its treatment. A great deal of the work of coping with illness depends
  on our capacity to find meaning in it, as Montaigne or Quintonce or Updike did – and there are, of course, countless other ways of doing so.</p>
<p>Indeed, I suspect that we all need to stylize ourselves in one way or another to make sense of illness, especially long-term and serious illness of the kind that afflicted Quintonce and Updike.
  Quintonce sees himself in the light of Caesar, and there are certainly worse ways of seeing oneself. His approach is much more urbane than that of Updike. In any case, stylizing ourselves when we
  are ill, and thinking about how our illness might allow us to emulate those we admire, can be productive. Reflecting on what these individuals might say to us in our illness also helps, I think.
  And this applies not just to illness, of course.</p>
<p>Whilst I have been seeking in this chapter to draw attention to people whom it might be helpful to emulate, we each have to find our own sources of help. This is why we need to try to be
  attentive to others around us and the story of their life, in order to discover the interesting, the strange, the good and the lovely in them, which we so often miss in the general rush of everyday
  life. By doing so, not only can we understand them better, but we can also understand ourselves better too.</p>
<p>Making Things Worse</p>
<p>But if it is true that we seek meaning in illness, sometimes we can entertain extravagant and unrealistic thoughts about it. This can make matters worse. So, for example, we
  often link illness and morality, construing illness as a form of punishment. Father Paneloux, in Albert Camus’s novel The Plague, represents someone who thinks this way, at least at
  the outset, telling his congregation that the plague has come to their town, Oran, as a punishment for their sinful ways. This kind of thing can be found again and again in human history, and it
  has not disappeared. As Susan Sontag reminds us in her book Illness as Metaphor, illnesses – her examples are tuberculosis, cancer and AIDS – have often been used as metaphors:
  sometimes to blame, sometimes to punish and sometimes for other purposes, such as to control. Her aim in her book is to strip illness of metaphor – ‘I have this disease because I am a
  bad person; this illness is a punishment’, and so on – in order to remove from it the meanings that make the suffering even worse.</p>
<p>A good and moving example of someone who found meaning in his illness (tuberculosis), but in such a way as to make things worse, was Kafka, whose pained relationship with his father I explored a
  little in the first chapter. In many ways Kafka was a highly tormented man: as a German-speaking Jew in Prague he felt himself to be an outsider and lived in an almost permanent sense of unease and
  disorientation, deeply torn as he was between his profound need to be a writer, the requirement to earn his living, and his longing to be able to settle down and have a family. Mentally troubled by
  this, and with a strong tendency to lacerating forms of self-enquiry and judgement, he constantly thought of his body as inadequate to the spiritual demands he made on himself, and reproached
  himself for just this:</p>
<p>It is certain that a major obstacle to my progress is my physical condition. Nothing can be accomplished with such a body . . . My body is too long for its weakness, it
      hasn’t the least bit of fat to engender a blessed warmth, to preserve an inner fire, no fat on which the spirit could occasionally nourish itself beyond its daily need without damage to
      the whole. (The Diaries of Franz Kafka 1910–1923: 124–5)</p>
<p>When Kafka suffered his first attack of tuberculosis in 1917, he immediately sought for a meaning to his disease, and construed it as a metaphor for his illness of soul.
  ‘For secretly,’ he wrote to Felice Bauer, his fiancée, ‘I don’t believe this illness to be tuberculosis, but rather a sign of my general bankruptcy’. He also
  construed his tuberculosis in terms of his relationship to his mother, from whom he thought he had inherited it, deriving from it, he wrote in the same letter, ‘the kind of immense support a
  child gets from clinging to its mother’s skirts’ (Letters to Felice: 655). Kafka, of course, knew he had tuberculosis, but what he meant was that, although it was an illness,
  it was a metaphor for what was really wrong with him – namely his spiritual condition. Kafka saw his tuberculosis not simply as an illness, but as a form of self-judgement;
  it betrayed him. Moreover, he went on to show a further level of emotional and intellectual investment in his disease, seeing it as both sign and cause of creativity – the creativity
  that enabled him to write as he so deeply needed to. Furthermore, he saw it as both a reason for his not getting married and as something that might have gone away had he married.</p>
<p>The case of Kafka is instructive because it shows the lengths to which some will go to find meaning in their illness. It goes without saying that I am not intending to criticize him. Far from
  it. My point is rather that we can see in Kafka someone whose torments are made even greater as a result of the particular way in which he sought for a meaning in his illness. If you had been
  Kafka’s friend you would almost certainly have encouraged him to be gentler on himself. That thought might help you if you have a tendency to be hard on yourself when you are ill, even if you
  do not go to the same lengths as Kafka in seeking to find meaning in your pain: you might be able to turn it towards yourself and be a little kinder to yourself.</p>
<p>Blaming Others</p>
<p>But often, when we are ill, it is not simply that we can be harsh on ourselves, as Kafka was on himself: we often have a very strong tendency to blame others for our condition,
  even as we know that they are not responsible. I do not mean, of course, that every ill person consciously holds others to blame for the illness. When one is ill it is more likely that one will
  experience anger – anger with the world, anger because one thinks the world unjust, anger expressed in the thought ‘Why me?’ And since other people are part of the world, they are
  likely to become the objects of one’s anger as they stray into one’s path, so to speak. One takes it out on others. There can be great pleasure in this, even if it is an
  unedifying spectacle. Indeed, the narrator in Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel The Leopard remarks at one point that ‘the intense pleasure of crying “it’s your
  fault” [is] the most powerful that the human creature is able to enjoy’ (Il Gattopardo: 112). But the world, as such, is neither just nor unjust; it just is. This is
  part of what Montaigne was getting at when he said one should not complain about undergoing something that could happen to anyone.</p>
<p>Apropos of the tendency to take out one’s anger on others when one is ill, Samuel Johnson remarked: ‘[D]isease produces much selfishness. A man in pain is looking after ease’
  (The Table Talk of Dr Johnson: 81). And it does indeed seem, as I have intimated, to be a natural reflex of the human mind to seek to discharge itself on others for its pains and
  sufferings. In fact, it is arguable that much that passes for moral judgement is really this unpleasant human tendency decked out in fine-sounding words. Be that as it may, Johnson, who was ill for
  much of his life – he once said that he had hardly known a pain-free day in his life – was exemplary in his capacity to resist the temptation to suppose that others were responsible for
  his illnesses. There is a huge capacity in Johnson to cut through appearances and make us face the reality of our condition. For example, he once remarked to his friend Boswell that the latter was
  forever complaining of being melancholy; this, he believed, showed that Boswell liked his mental suffering. No one, he said,</p>
<p>talks of that which he is desirous to conceal, and every man desires to conceal that of which he is ashamed . . . [M]ake it an . . . obligatory law to yourself never to
      mention your own mental diseases; if you are never to speak of them, you will think on them but little; and if you think little of them, they will molest you rarely. When you talk of them, it
      is plain that you want either praise or pity; for praise there is no room, and pity will do you no good; therefore . . . speak no more, think no more about them. (The Table Talk of Dr
      Johnson: 81)</p>
<p>This is Johnson at his most stoical, and there is something almost frightening in his words, especially perhaps to modern-day readers, who live in an age proud of its
  willingness to speak of mental sufferings. Of course, Johnson is speaking of mental suffering, but physical illness can often evoke mental suffering, so that the two become entangled. Again, none
  of this is to suggest that we should forego treatment for physical illness – Johnson knew as well anyone that any reasonable person prefers health to sickness. The point is rather that we are
  often surprisingly ready to burden others with talk of our illnesses, as Boswell burdened Johnson. Of course, we sometimes need help from friends when we are ill, and we do need to talk with them
  about what we are experiencing, but the political theorist and philosopher Hannah Arendt was surely right when she said that</p>
<p>we can scarcely help raising the question of selflessness, or rather the question of openness to others, which in fact is the precondition for ‘humanity’ in
      every sense of that word. It seems evident that sharing joy is absolutely superior in this respect to sharing suffering. Gladness, not sadness, is talkative, and truly human dialogue differs
      from mere talk or even discussion in that it is entirely permeated by pleasure in the other person and what he says. It is tuned to the key of gladness, we might say. (‘On Humanity in
      Dark Times: Thoughts About Lessing’:15)</p>
<p>Perhaps if we are ill, one of the things we most need is the gladness of friendship, and we need to seek to preserve our friendships in gladness, rather than a kind of sadness
  which involves a concentration on the fact that we are ill. So I am inclined to say: if you are ill, seek comfort from your friends, but remember that it is gladness rather than sadness which best
  nourishes you, your friend and your friendship. If you manage to laugh in and through your illness, that will probably help you.</p>
<p>The Will to Live</p>
<p>Someone who took this kind of thing to heart – I mean, the importance of gladness and laughter, with or without friends – is Norman Cousins. In his classic work
  Anatomy of an Illness, Cousins describes how after a trip to the Soviet Union in 1964 he fell ill from a very rare, virtually untreatable and extremely serious collagen illness. Collagen
  is the substance that binds cells together, and Cousins discovered that his collagen was breaking down. He was, as he put it, ‘coming unstuck’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 33). He
  had, he was told, a 1-in-500 chance of recovery. Reasoning that there was little the doctors could do for him, Cousins checked himself out of the hospital and into a hotel. He was well versed in
  medical literature, and remembered having read about the idea that negative emotions could have a negative effect on the body. He wondered whether positive emotions might have a positive effect.
  The question arose for him whether ‘love, hope, faith, laughter, confidence, and the will to live have therapeutic value’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 38).</p>
<p>Cousins tried it out. He abandoned the standard treatment given to him by his doctors, believing on good evidence that this treatment would, in fact, do him more harm than good. He devised his
  own interventions, such as administering to himself large amounts of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) since some medical reports indicated that certain patients suffering from collagen disease were
  deficient in vitamin C. But he also devised a programme to cheer himself up, to make him laugh: he got hold of comic films, such as those by the Marx Brothers, and watched them. Incredibly, his
  physical symptoms started to abate. Eventually he made a pretty full recovery.</p>
<p>Laughing at duck soup rather than eating it might help you recover from illness.</p>
<p>Cousins grants that the vitamin C may have had purely a placebo effect. He is happy to accept this, because it supports his main point: he is convinced that ‘the will to live is not a
  theoretical abstraction, but a physiologic reality with therapeutic characteristics’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 49), so whether the vitamin C had any effect other than
  encouraging him to think positively was neither here nor there. As evidence of the will to live, he presents not only his own case, but those of two other people: Pablo Casals, the great cellist,
  and Albert Schweitzer, the theologian and medical missionary. He says that he learnt from them that ‘a highly developed purpose and the will to live are among the prime raw materials of human
  existence. I became convinced that these materials may well represent the most potent force within human reach’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 79).</p>
<p>Obviously, Cousins is in many ways an exception, not least because he was well-read on medical matters. Moreover, his aim is certainly not to dismiss the massive advances made by modern medical
  science or to claim that we could do without them. Nor is he claiming that diseases such as his are caused by negative emotions or cured by positive ones. What he does believe, however, is that
  immunity to illness can be reduced by distress and increased by good spirits. And he is surely right that we in the modern West are becoming hypersensitive to pain, leading us to take medicines in
  an obsessive manner. He counsels a kind of healthy scepticism, so that we can ‘steer an intelligent course between promiscuous pill-popping and irresponsible disregard of genuine
  symptoms’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 101). That, of course, requires wisdom on our part. But, if Cousins is right, it also requires humour, an ability to laugh, and a kind of thirst or
  hunger for life of the kind he saw in Casals and Schweitzer: ‘creativity, the will to live, hope, faith, and love . . . contribute strongly to healing and well-being. The positive emotions
  are life-giving experiences’ (Anatomy of an Illness: 96). There is a lesson in that for all of us.</p>
