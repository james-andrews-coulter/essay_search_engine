        <h3>Mental health failure</h3>
<p>For most of our lives, if we are lucky, our minds do roughly what we want them to. They come alive and fall asleep as we command; they go in the direction we steer them towards. They are quiet when we need to unwind, they are unimaginative when we need to concentrate and they stop repeating ideas when we have heard them sufficiently often.</p>
<p>Until – for some of us – our minds become our enemies. We lie in bed in the early hours and beg them to switch off, but still they continue to buzz and whirr, throwing out random worries and projects and visions as the hours turn from two to three to four – and all chances of a productive day ahead recede. Sometimes our minds get stuck on a particular loop of anxiety: they panic again and again about what might happen during a speech or a meeting, a shopping trip or dinner with a friend. Their ringing gets so loud, their worries so catastrophic, that we have to withdraw from an active life. We reassure them as best we can and still they insist on hysteria. The most minor challenges grow unbearable. We fear that everything is about to come to an end, we see terror everywhere, we have to check and recheck every point of concern – and yet the counsel and wisdom we take in can never stick. Or, afflicted in a different way, we might grow sad and heavy for reasons that our minds refuse to yield: we don’t quite know what is unbearable, only that it is so, and that we are wretched and undeserving, and that nothing we do can be good enough – that we would be better off dead.</p>
<p>Few among us who have avoided such torments can take them seriously; they so easily seem like malingering – or pure hallucination. Those who mention them must be exaggerating. But the sad reality is that our minds are no less prone to malfunctioning than other organs of our bodies, and in no less dreadful ways. They can be instruments of torture. When our minds break down, we find ourselves unable to work, go out in public, approach any challenge with confidence, act as a responsible parent or build new relationships. We live in paranoia about disgrace and shame – we don’t trust ourselves not to say something shocking or to harm ourselves or someone we care for. We fail in these instances not because of anything that has happened in the world, but because the minds through which we perceive it have turned against us.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ultimately, we are prone to failure because we are tragic animals; creatures whose constitution is inherently unsuited to the complicated tasks thrown up by our long and multifaceted lives. We fail in our ability to read the world with the perspicacity and intelligence required. We don’t notice until it is much too late where we have missed clues, where we have been hasty or arrogant, where we have been incautious or conceited. Our minds are not powerful enough, and not well-trained enough, to take on board all the lessons we would need to stay cautious and safe across all the demands we face. We blunder into scenarios assuming we know how to handle them. We worry too much in some areas and not nearly enough in others. We celebrate too soon. We grow proud of ourselves and dare to assume that we know how to live – hubristically believing that we are not at the mercy of what we might as well call – with zero religious intent – the gods. And all the while, our lives dangle on a thread, vulnerable to governments, religions, ideologies, businesses, families and our own fragile neurochemistry.</p>
<p>In the 4th century, the Christian scholar and monk Evagrius the Solitary – who spent most of his life in a hut in the Egyptian desert – defined seven ‘evil tendencies’ that needed to be overcome in order to lead a godly life. From his list emerged medieval Christendom’s resonant concept of the seven deadly sins: lust, pride, greed, wrath, envy, gluttony and sloth. We can imagine these operating beneath most of our disasters – of all the kinds listed above – even today. Christian writers put this dilemma grandly and poetically: we sin not by chance, but because we are the descendants of sinners; all of us are tainted by Adam and Eve’s ‘original sin’ (what St Augustine termed peccatum originale). It isn’t in our power to insulate ourselves wholly from the worst sides of our nature – man is a faultily designed, congenitally sinning animal.</p>
<p>We may try to be sexually sensible, for example, but the temptations are many and often unheralded. All that tragedy requires is a frustrated marriage and a night away. The ingredients that might have made for banter, an indulgent smile and an unremarkable acknowledgement of appetite when we were single can concoct – once there are legal strictures in place – combustible material for a scandal from which no recovery is possible. We need only have a slightly too intense desire to hold and to be held, to caress, to touch, to lay a hand – and we are doomed. The tripwires are everywhere, artfully hidden: across barriers of age, workplace regulations and internet addresses.</p>
<p>We don’t notice ourselves wanting far too much: admiration, money, acclaim. It happens – as it tends to with sins – slowly and imperceptibly. But the more it grips us, the more we lose our ability to spot our errors. We cut corners, make unnecessary enemies and are impatient and careless – we gradually tie the noose around our own necks.</p>
<p>When we are proud, we stop noticing the ways in which we humiliate others; we forget to regularly remind ourselves of how flawed and absurd we are. We start to take ourselves very seriously – and we build up a store of anger in those around us. Every success we chalk up has quietly hurt someone else, and for a long time, they can’t protest, because we can dominate and crush them with our power. But we have enemies, there is blood in the water – and when we make a mistake, they will be ready to turn it into an irreparable wound.</p>
<p>We might not think of ourselves as ‘lazy’, either, but the word doesn’t have to be restricted to those who sleep in past midday and don’t do the housework. There are deeper kinds of laziness: the intellectual laziness that stops us from examining our own natures; the moral laziness that stops us exhibiting kindness; the professional laziness that prevents us from seeing that we are engaged in ultimately noxious pursuits that are harming those around us.</p>
<p>It sounds old-fashioned to warn anyone of such sins – the word even sounds a little charming or comedic. But sins are nothing of the sort: they are the broken paving stones on which we can trip and shatter our lives. The point isn’t really to warn at all – it’s too late for that. Simply, to recognise these pitfalls is to provide a little perspective to the reasons why we fail. We should remember that our errors take their place within a more than 2,000-year history of messing up.</p>
<p>To speak in more psychological language, our brains are cognitively, congenitally flawed. They don’t give us the information necessary to succeed in our goals – we don’t have the right dials on our instrument panel and the warning lights largely don’t function. It is appallingly easy to ruin, or at least heavily dent, our lives – and as no one really tells us how not to, most of us at some point will. We should not – on top of it all – ever feel alone with our catastrophes.</p>
