        <h3>Leaning into vulnerability</h3>
<p>For many of us, whenever we feel scared, sad, anxious or lonely, the last thing we would think of doing is sharing our distress; a confession threatens to make an already difficult situation untenable. We assume that our best chance of defending ourselves and recovering our self-possession is to say nothing. When we are sad at a gathering of friends, we smile. When we are terrified before a speech, we try to change the subject. When we’re asked how we’re coping, we say, ‘Very well indeed, thank you.’ We aren’t deliberately out to deceive; we are practising the only manoeuvre we know and trust in response to our vulnerability.</p>
<p>What we fear above all is judgement. We are social creatures who have come to equate being accepted with appearing poised. We assume that we could not explain what is really going on inside us and survive unblemished. In our eyes, the price of safety is the maintenance of a permanent semblance of composure.</p>
<p>However, there might be an alternative to this punishing and isolating philosophy: rather than insisting on our well-being at moments of fear, sadness, anxiety and loneliness, we might actually reveal that things aren’t perfect for us; that we’re pretty scared right now; that we’re finding it hard to talk to people or maintain faith in the future; that we feel anxious and in need of company.</p>
<p>Although we might be alarmed at the prospect of divulging such sentiments, it might help us arrive at some surprising discoveries. We might immediately feel lighter and less oppressed; our connection with those around us might become significantly deeper by sharing more of the turmoil of our inner lives; and, most unexpectedly of all, the revelation of our vulnerability could make us appear stronger rather than weaker in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Some of our regrettable furtiveness comes from imagining that all disclosures of fear, sadness, anxiety and loneliness must be the same. But this is to ignore a critical difference between a revelation that comes across as an insistent, desperate demand for rescue, and one that frames a problem with an attitude of sober, sad dignity. There is a distinction between begging never to be left alone again and revealing that one has been finding one’s evenings a bit quiet of late. There can be a firm and dependable barrier between neediness and vulnerability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rather than merely not threatening our dignity, revelation may be the very ingredient that enhances it. However impressive it may superficially be never to show weakness, it is much more impressive to have the courage, psychological insight and self-discipline to talk about one’s weaknesses in a boundaried and contained way. It is the mark of a real adult to be able to disclose, with a mixture of aplomb and tact, aspects of one’s childlike self: that one has been going through a dreadful time; that one really doesn’t want to be here; or that one is very worried about seeming like an idiot. True toughness isn’t about maintaining a facade of military robustness, but about an artful negotiation with, and unfrightened acceptance of, one’s regressive, dependent aspects.</p>
<p>The ability to pull this off relies on a further piece of maturity: the knowledge that everyone is, at heart, as scared, sad, lonely and anxious as we are. Even if they choose not to reveal this, we can make an empathetic leap of faith that they do so, not because they are fundamentally different and more robustly constituted than us, but because they are scared.</p>
<p>We are all hemmed in by an image of what it means to be a serious adult that doesn’t allow us to share our vulnerable reality, and thereby makes us all sick and alienated from ourselves and from one another. We should accept that it is normal to be lonely, even though everyone is meant to have all the friends they need; that it is normal to be sick with worry, even though we’re meant to have faith in the future.</p>
<p>In revealing our weaknesses, we are proving we are like our audiences in their true, but hitherto needlessly hidden, reality: we are somersaulting over a social barrier and generously creating a space in which others too may come to feel safe enough to show their fragility and humanity. We can lean into our fears rather than treating them as shameful enemies. Every confession, ably executed, alleviates rather than enforces our burdens. Rather than seeing the world as an entity that we must constantly impress, and our reality as something we must perpetually hide, we can dare to imagine that others would not mind us showing more of our true selves. There might be nothing more generous or impressive we could offer our neighbours than a tranquil disclosure of our feelings of sadness, isolation, worry and existential despair.</p>
