        <h2>3. Explore Reverie</h2>
<p>Carl Jung’s own book The Undiscovered Self, which he wrote to try and explain his ideas to a non-specialist readership, puts my very inadequate description of
  his notion of ‘the active imagination’ into a wider theoretical context. Routledge published a new edition in 2002. Anthony Stevens’s Jung: a very short introduction
  (Oxford University Press, 2001) is also helpful.</p>
<p>Many people find ‘free writing’ is a helpful way of accessing this sort of material. Free writing is a technique originally developed to help with ‘writer’s block’
  and is advocated by many creative writing guides like Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way (Pan, 1992) and Natalie Goldberg’s Writing Down the Bones (Shambhala
  Publications, 1986). The basic idea is that you set yourself a time limit (say fifteen minutes or half an hour) and you write, without stopping, whatever comes into your mind. You do not read it
  until afterwards and you do not correct it. For people who find more traditional reverie difficult or ‘pointless’, the act of writing seems to provide a focus.</p>
