            <h3>¶ Good Materialism</h3>
<p>When people seek to pinpoint the root cause of corruption in our age, they generally need only to point to our attachment to material things. We are sick because we are so profoundly materialistic.</p>
<p>It can seem as if we’re faced with a stark choice: to be materialistic – obsessed with money and possessions, shallow and selfish – or to reject materialism, be good and focus on more important matters of the spirit.</p>
<p>Most of us are stuck somewhere between these two choices. We are still enmeshed in the desire to possess while hating ourselves for being so.</p>
<p>Crucially, it’s not actually materialism – the pure fact of buying things and getting excited by possessions – that is really the problem. We’re failing to make a clear distinction between good and bad versions of materialism.</p>
<p>Let’s try to understand good materialism through a slightly unusual route: religion. Because we see religions as focused exclusively on spiritual things, it can be surprising to note how much use they have made of material things. They have spent a lot time making and thinking about shrines, temples, monasteries, art works, scrolls to hang in houses, clothes and ceremonies.</p>
<p>However, they have wanted material things to serve the highest and noblest purpose: the development of our souls. It is just that they have recognised that we are incarnate, sensory, bodily beings, and that the way to get through to our souls must be through our bodies rather than merely through the intellect.</p>
<p>For centuries, the importance of material things was at the core of Christianity, which proposed that Jesus was both the highest spiritual being, and a flesh and blood person. He was the spirit incarnate; holiness embodied.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Mass, great significance is accorded to bread and wine, which are believed to be transubstantiations of Christ: that is, material objects that simultaneously have a spiritual identity, just as Jesus himself combined the spiritual and the bodily while on earth.</p>
<p>This can sound like an arcane point entirely removed from the local shopping mall, but exactly the same concept applies outside of religions. Many good material possessions can be said to involve a kind of ‘transubstantiation’, whereby they are both practical and physical and also embody or allude to a positive personality or spirit.</p>
<p>One can imagine a handsome wooden chair that ‘tran-substantiates’ a set of important values: straightforwardness, strength, honesty and elegance. By getting closer to the chair, we could become a little more like it.</p>
<p>Material objects can be said to play a positive psychological (or spiritual) role in our lives when higher, more positive, ideals are ‘materialised’ in them. Therefore, buying them and using them daily gives us a chance to get closer to our better selves. When they are contained in physical things, valuable psychological qualities that are otherwise often intermittent in our thoughts and conduct can become more stable and resilient.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all consumerism is unproblematic; it depends on what a given material object stands for. An object can transubstantiate the very worst sides of human nature – greed, callousness, the desire to triumph – as much as it can the best. So we must be careful not to decry or celebrate all material consumption: we have to ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by making, are those that lend encouragement to the best sides of our natures.</p>
