            <h2>VIIIEqualOpportunity</h2>
<p>The modern world was founded upon, and continues to be enthused by, the promise of equal opportunity – and infinite possibility – for all. Each of us grows up with a sense that a great deal could be possible. Adults listen respectfully when small children suggest they might travel to the Space Station, run the country or play for a winning team. Such feats aren’t wholly fanciful, particularly when considered through parental eyes. Similarly transformative journeys are everywhere to behold. It would be churlish to ignore that extraordinary destinies are a regular feature of modern life.</p>
<p>The idea of equal opportunity springs from the most generous side of our nature and has been responsible for inspiring the most indispensable achievements. But it has also, unwittingly and far more quietly, been the source of unending sorrow. American psychologist William James (1842–1910) recognised the anxiety created by societies that promise their inhabitants infinite opportunities for social transformation and career success – and then can’t always deliver. For James, satisfaction with ourselves does not require us to succeed in every area. We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are humiliated only if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it. Our ambitions determine what we will interpret as a triumph and what must count as a failure. ‘With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,’ wrote James. ‘It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities’. Thus:</p>
<p>The problem with the modern world is that it does not stop lending us extremely high expectations and inviting us to dream, and then leaving us with a bitter sense of failure.</p>
<p>A firm belief in the limitations of life was once one of humankind’s most important assets; a bulwark against bitterness and envy; a wisdom cruelly undermined by the ideology of infinite expectation proclaimed by the modern worldview. Feeling ‘successful’ might not be so much about having many things, as a matter of having what we long for. Success is not an absolute. It is relative to desire; every time we seek something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, whatever our resources.</p>
<p>Insofar as advanced societies provide us with many options for success, they appear to be helping us. But in truth, the net effect may be to humiliate us: through a language of unlimited opportunity, these societies keep open a permanent gap between who we want to be and what we have achieved. There are two ways to make people feel more successful: to give them more success, or to narrow their ambitions. Modern capitalism has in certain areas succeeded spectacularly at the first option, but, by stretching our aspirations, it has left a painful gap between our hopes and our reality – a gap we are left to fill with shame and rage.</p>
