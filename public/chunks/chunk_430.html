            <h2>Confession</h2>
<p>In the Christian tradition, much more so in the olden days than now, it has been customary to head to a small, dark wooden box, about the size of two conjoined phone boxes, and let everything out: what one has done, what one is sorry for and, perhaps, where one remains defiant. After this, a voice would come from the other side of a curtain or grille, reframing the event, placing it within the context of divine love, sympathising but also admonishing – and ending by offering a road to redemption.</p>
<p>In our rush to build a more reasonable, secular world, we have not known how to replace this practice, the function of which has in fact nothing to do with the supernatural but belongs squarely within the requirements of ordinary psychology and civic life. Instead, we have the law, which seeks earthly justice and hands out punishment to transgressors, but proceeds in an implacable way that merely leads most of the accused to deny what they have done and hate those who have asked them to take responsibility. From the legal standpoint, there is no attempt to address the soul of the perpetrator; the idea is chiefly to keep the streets safe and appease the public’s hunger for vengeance. How different this is from the Christian approach, which assumes that everyone is a sinner from the outset, insists that everyone routinely errs, and which therefore offers forgiveness for all those courageous enough to examine their consciences and atone with requisite humility.</p>
<p>Instead, the modern world offers up – through the instrument of the media – a version of the old-fashioned pillory, where transgressors are lampooned, where it is automatically assumed that those who did wrong meant to do so and where there is no mercy or sympathy on offer – and therefore, again, no incentive for honesty or confession. Public shaming has – absurdly – become the sole instrument of moral improvement. What would a more psychologically rich processing of error look like? We can imagine the following stages.</p>
