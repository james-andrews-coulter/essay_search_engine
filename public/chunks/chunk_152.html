            <h1>Homework</h1>
<p>In addition to the books I have discussed in the main body of the text, and amongst the many things that could be studied with profit, I would recommend the following relevant
  works.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Pierre Hadot’s Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 1995), tr. Michael Chase, ed. and intro.
  Arnold Davidson, provides both an introduction to philosophy and makes a case for the therapeutic value of philosophical reflection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ambivalence; or, Adversity in the Family</li>
</ol>
<p>Julia Blackburn’s The Three of Us (London: Jonathan Cape, 2008) provides many insights into the nature of a deeply fractured family from the point of view of the
  child. A painful but fascinating read.</p>
<p>A useful introduction to Melanie Klein’s thinking, with references, is Hanna Segal’s Melanie Klein (New York: Viking Press, 1979).</p>
<p>Yasujiro Ozu’s film Tokyo Story (1953) is a mercilessly insightful dissection of relations between parents and children.</p>
<ol>
<li>Incomprehension; or, Adversity in Love</li>
</ol>
<p>Simon May’s Love: a History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012) provides a good survey of some of the varying attitudes towards love in the Western
  tradition.</p>
<p>Philosophies of Love (Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 1971), eds David L. Norton and Mary F. Kille is a really useful anthology, containing extracts from key philosophers on
  the different kinds of love.</p>
<p>Irving Singer has written extensively on love from a philosophical point of view. His Philosophy of Love: a Partial Summing-Up (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009) is a good place to
  start.</p>
<p>Five interesting case studies from psychoanalysis exploring some of the difficulties of intimate relations are to be found in Deborah Luepnitz’s Schopenhauer’s Porcupines:
  Intimacy and its Dilemmas (New York: Basic Books, 2002).</p>
<p>C. S. Lewis’s The Four Loves (London: HarperCollins, 2012) has some stimulating things to say about different kinds of love. His idea that one of the functions of eros is to play
  the buffoon in our lives has the ring of truth about it.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lear’s Love and its Place in Nature (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998) explores its theme from a psychoanalytic point of view.</p>
<p>Love, Sex and Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes Our Lives (London: John Murray, 2004) by Simon Goldhill is a thoroughly enjoyable read which relates the modern and ancient worlds in
  order to enlighten us about our condition.</p>
<p>Caroline J. Simon’s The Disciplined Heart (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans, 1997) discusses love in various contexts from a philosophical and theological point of
  view, helpfully exploring many literary examples.</p>
<p>Amongst filmmakers, I would especially recommend the work of Michelangelo Antonioni as a director who explores insightfully problems of erotic love in modernity. His L’Avventura
  (1960) is a masterpiece. Pretty much most of Eric Rohmer’s films deal with the same issue, in a quite different way. His early Ma nuit chez Maud (1969) is still as pertinent now as
  when it was made. And Woody Allen has much to say on modern love that is helpful. My favourite is probably Hannah and her Sisters (1986).</p>
<ol>
<li>Vulnerability; or, Adversity in the Body</li>
</ol>
<p>Sarah Bakewell’s How to Live: a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer (London: Vintage, 2011) is very helpful on many aspects of
  Montaigne’s philosophy, including his attitude to death and illness. Michael Screech’s Montaigne and Melancholy (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991) is fascinating on
  Montaigne’s ideas, his intellectual context and background, and is full of wise things.</p>
<p>A really helpful book on Kafka’s attitude to his body and to his illness is Sander Gilman’s Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient (London: Routledge, 1995).</p>
<p>Virginia Woolf’s On Being Ill (Ashfield, MA: Paris Press, 2002) is the best short piece on illness I know.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dissolution; or, Adversity in Dying</li>
</ol>
<p>A very helpful reader, which contains a good introductory essay and then extracts from key philosophers on death, is Herbert Fingarette’s Death: Philosophical
  Soundings (Chicago: Open Court, 1997).</p>
<p>Death (Stocksfield: Acumen, 2006) by Geoffrey Scarre is one of the better one-volume, concise introductions to the topic of death as discussed in academic philosophy.</p>
<p>Two modern classics on death from the philosophical literature are Bernard Williams’s ‘The Makropulos Case: Reflections on the Tedium of Immortality’ in his Problems of the
  Self (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976) and Thomas Nagel’s (partial) rejoinder ‘Death’ in his Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
  2012).</p>
<p>Hirokazu Kore-Eda’s film After Life (1998) is an insightful exploration of death.</p>
