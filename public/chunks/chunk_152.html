            <h3>¶ Splitting and Integration</h3>
<p>The pioneering mid-20th-century Viennese psychoanalyst Melanie Klein drew attention to something very dramatic that happens in the minds of babies during feeding sessions with their mothers. When feeding goes well, the baby is blissfully happy and sees mummy as ‘good’. But if, for whatever reason, the feeding process is difficult, the baby can’t grasp that it is dealing with the same person it liked a lot only a few hours ago. It splits off from the actual mother a second, ‘bad’ version, whom it deems to be a separate, hateful individual, responsible for deliberately frustrating its wishes, and in the process, protecting the image of the good mother in its mind.</p>
<p>Gradually, if things go well, there follows a long and difficult process by which the child integrates these two different people and comes, sadly but realistically, to grasp that there is no ideal, ‘perfect’ mummy – just one person who is usually lovely but can also be cross, busy, tired, who can make mistakes, and be very interested in other people.</p>
<p>It may have been a long time since we were being fed as babies, but the tendency to ‘split’ those close to us is always there, for we never fully outgrow our childhood selves. In adult life, we may fall deeply in love and split off an ideal version of someone, in whom we see no imperfections and whom we adore without limit. Yet we may suddenly and violently turn against the partner (or a celebrity or a politician) whose good qualities once impressed us, the moment we discover the slightest thing that disturbs or frustrates us in them. We may conclude that they cannot really be good since they have made us suffer.</p>
<p>We may find it extremely hard to accept that the same person might be very nice and good in some ways and strikingly disappointing in others. The bad version can appear to destroy the good one, although these are really just different and connected aspects of one complex person.</p>
<p>To cope with the conflict between hope and reality, our culture should teach us good integration skills, prompting us to accept what is imperfect in ourselves and others. We should be gently reminded that no one we can love will ever satisfy us completely, but that it is never worth hating them on that score alone. We should move from the naivety and rage of Splitting to the mature wisdom of Integration.</p>
