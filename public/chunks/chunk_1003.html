        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>My thanks go to everyone who has made this book possible, especially my agent Barbara Levy and all the staff at the School of Life and at Pan Macmillan, especially Morgwn Rimel,
  Cindy Chan, Robin Harvie, Zennor Compton, Laura Carr, Marcia Mihotich and Jonathan Baker, all of whom have been endlessly helpful. Above all, my thanks go to Caroline Brimmer, who originally
  invited me to help her develop the ‘How to Choose a Partner’ course at the School of Life, and whose talent, insight and support have been an inspiration; without Caroline, this book
  would not have happened.</p>
