        <h2>The Kitchen Window Observatory London</h2>
<p>Fortunately, we don’t need to go to one of the worid’s finest observatories | in the Atacama desert in Chile, Mauna Kea in Hawaii or Mount Teide in Tenerife to benefit from the wisdom of their powerful lenses. All we need is a wellsitioned window ledge and a little patience.
In the autumn of 2016, the English photographer Adam Gold had recently returned fom a lengthy stay in a hospital near London. He had been treated for depression that had lasted more than a year. Without wholly understanding the draw, he began to spend long evenings at the kitchen window of his small flat, from which he could on a clear night, despite the lights of hundreds of houses nearby gain an unexpectedly detailed view of the universe above. He could glimpse the planet Venus and there were sightings of the constellations of Bodtes, Corona Borealis and Hercules. One night even offered up the Eta Aquariids meteor shower.
Sensing the healing effect of this nighttime observation, Gold began to take a series of photographs dedicated to tracking events in the sky as he could spot them from his own window. He could, of course, have gained more astonishing vistas by going to a desert peak, but his point was precisely to remind us, and himself, of how much of the universe might continue to be observable even in a highly crowded, often frenetic and light-polluted metropolis. Many of his images deliberately retain, at their edges, eminders of their humdrum locations: the Windowsill, neighbour’s window, a passing Plane. We have no excuse for not accessing the “smic perspective, wherever we might be; a Measure of calm is always to hand.
The night sky doesn’t address us in words. sn’t argue with us. It appreciates that at po It doe times Sooth; : et message of the night is encoded in “Sory elements, It bypasses our logical minds ry,
The night reorients us. If we sleep, our dreams will be usefully unsettling and strange. The certainties of the daytime world will be upset. We’ll learn that we still miss someone we were supposed to have forgotten a long time ago. Or that we’re attracted to an enemy, or that we are more vulnerable than we had Supposed. And if we can’t sleep, under the light of the stars, we’ll be able to come at our dilemmas from new and unfamiliar angles. The difference between hope and despair is often just a different way of telling stories from the same set of facts.
The 17th-century Dutch philosopher Spinoza made a famous distinction between two ways of contemplating existence. We could either see it egoistically, from our limited point of view, or as he put it, sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time). Or we could look at things universally and eternally: sub specie aeternitatis (under the aspect of eternity). For Spinoza, our nature means that we are divided between the two. Our fears and desires can pull us towards a time-bound, partial view. Yet our reasoned intelligence can equally well at privileged moments allow us and here Spinoza becomes unexpectedly lyrical to participate in eternal totality. We don’t need to wait until we have built our own observatory to participate in eternal totality. Tonight, our own window ledge will be more than enough.</p>
<p>Fernando de Noronha, Brazil
Compared with all the talk that surrounds the scope and the telescope, the aeroplane satis rocket, strangely little is ever said about and ually innovative instruments that have eos up alternative worlds to us: the mask se the snorkel. Associated in our imaginations with summer holidays, their grander therapeutic missions have been obscured. Schoolchildren ‘know all about the Wright brothers and the Apollo programme; but no one seems to have properly registered the birth of the diving mask (1933) and the J-shaped snorkel (1950). Seventy per cent of the planet may be ocean; less than one per cent of all photography and art concerns itself with what lies under the water. We have paid extravagant attention to the remote possibility of extraterrestrials and ignored the mesmerising reality of the whitemargin stargazer and the tassled scorpionfish.
More than 550 kilometres off the northern coast of Brazil, the beaches on the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha are one of the finer locations from which to launch ourselves into aquatic space. Dipping our heads under the water, we’re offered one of the strangest splitscreen sights in the world: through the upper half of the mask, we see the sun, the sky, a few palm trees and familiar wisps of cloud; through the lower half, beneath a faint line of what looks like mercury, all traces of familiarity are gone. There are no more hotel buffets and cocktails, roads or buildings, only sea sponges and coral, beds of variegated gravel and forests of dense Seaweed interspersed with algae-coated rocks.
There are also some extremely oddus, as though it were coming to an nclusion on a substantial subject. ah on makes its way across the seabed Enlq Plainingly, lugging along one massively 9ed Yellow claw with which it might hope important rere) Ab to fix itself lunch. There are sc a stingray performs a landing manoeuvre in the sand; a rock lobster naps between two rocks that perfectly match its shell. Language
struggles to get itself around the oddities that dwell here: the short-nosed batfish, the squirrel fish, the rock beauty. God may happily have given names to all the land animals but understandably may have lost momentum when it came to those beneath the waves, It feels as if we had stepped into a very strange party whose members, perhaps after ingesting an unknown psychedelic, were pursuing their own dreams and projects without possibility of connection. But these guests are hools of trunkfish; &gt; for all that benevolently indifferent. A trunkfish ambles past on a search for algae without any curiosity or questions: everything seems allowed, no one would bat an eyelid.
Chiefly, they don’t care: they don’t know who the president is or who won the war. They particularly don’t care about the gossip about us, our disappointed career ambitions and the frustrations in our relationship. The silvery porcupinefish has no thought of your brother; the yellowhead wrasse has no conception of envy. And we can appreciate them, for this total disregard for the demented human agenda.
We were as small children amazed by everything; a light switch could detain us for hours. With maturity has come habituation and cynicism, yet still, the process does not have to go in only one direction. We are capable of returning to a less weary and blinkered place: we have a capacity for re-enchantment. And when it is engaged, we may notice, to our infinite and curative amazement, that in a universe composed chiefly of gas and rock circulating in the endless nothingness of space, g six-banded trevally has just swum below us In the warm ocean off Cachorro Beach on an eager search for a meal of cephalopods.</p>
