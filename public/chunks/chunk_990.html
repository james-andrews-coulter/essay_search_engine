        <h2>OUR LOVER WAS NOT UNIQUE</h2>
<p>They’ve gone and we miss them so much. No one can replace them: It feels as if we’ll never be happy again. A well-intentioned friend might advise us to just not think about them. But curiously it may be wiser, and ultimately more helpful, to force ourselves – if we can – to go over in our minds exactly what it is we miss about them.</p>
<p>Instead of just saying that we miss them, we can try to define what, precisely, piece by piece, was so nice about the relationship. Maybe they had a particularly sweet smile, or perhaps we were attracted to their worldly sophistication; it was great at the end of a difficult day to joke with them about our annoying colleagues; maybe they gave us confidence at parties; perhaps we like that they introduced us to their genial friends or understood us so well in bed …</p>
<p>When we say we miss them, what we really mean is that it is a set of good qualities and experiences that we are missing. It is tenderness, conviviality and open-mindedness we love, first and foremost, rather than, inherently, the bodily home in which these qualities came to rest. We encountered these things in and with them and so assume that to lose the person is to lose everything linked to them.</p>
<p>We’re right to miss the good things: We still need to see a sweet smile, we still need to encounter sophistication; we need cosiness and confidence and to be understood sexually. It’s true that we’ll never meet another person exactly like the lover we have just lost. They were unique. But the good things we met in and through them are general: They are available elsewhere – not all bundled up into one person in exactly this way, but distributed more widely across the species.</p>
<p>Other versions of such smiles exist, other versions of their sophisticated, slightly cynical take on life, other capacities to make ambitious weekend plans or laugh at pomposity. In losing one person, we can’t logically forever have lost contact with the elements that made them valuable – and that continue to exist, scattered throughout humanity.</p>
<p>One of the odder – and more profound – lessons of a broken heart is the eventual realisation that the focus of our love is not really an individual person, but a range of good things which – thankfully – cannot be the unique property of a single person but can be found in other potential partners, waiting for us to be ready to encounter them as soon as we are stronger.</p>
