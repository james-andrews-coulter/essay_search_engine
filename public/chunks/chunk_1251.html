        <h2>The Train Journey</h2>
<p>Ostensibly we might be on a journey to a provincial capital or a coastal town. But really, we’re on a journey around unfamiliar and neglected parts of our minds. Wherever the train might happen to be taking us, the incidental — though paramount — benefit of the trip is that it may help us to work out what we think.</p>
<p>Ordinary life goes by far too fast for most of what we have experienced to be adequately processed. There can be enough material in a five-minute exchange with a colleague to power reflections that could last many hours; a 300-page novel could be written in about a half hour inside our minds. Most of the time, we cannot begin to get to grips with the sensations coursing through us; we have no opportunity to notice more than a fraction of what we have lived through. No sooner has one event impacted on us than we are forced to move on to another, yet more turbulent or provocative one.</p>
<p>The inattention can make us ill and sad; we can grow afflicted by a general anxiety because we can’t understand what we’re specifically scared of. We are weighed down by diffuse sadness because we haven’t had the chance to notice what in particular has hurt us. We are irritable with the world because we haven’t had the opportunity to shout at one or two people, whose provocations we felt but don’t even consciously recall. We grow mentally unwell because we have been denied certain feelings that we are owed. We are foreigners to our own joys; we have not mourned our losses or had the encouragement to analyse our questions. We start to twitch and to wake up at 3 a.m., insomnia being the mind’s revenge for all the thoughts we carefully forgot to have in the day. It might have been many months since we were alone with ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, at last, we’re on the train — which doubles as a well-disguised machine for self-understanding. We were hoping that the carriage would be empty and we are in luck. There are just a couple of people at the rear; to all intents, we have the place to ourselves. So we take a seat at a window in one of the centre sections, bring out a pad and pen and fall into a reverie. There’s no agenda. We’re free associating, letting our thoughts come to us as they will, helped along by the rhythmic clicking of the rails and the passing views onto fields and forests.</p>
<p>Thinking is so hard because we are never far from a risk of stumbling into the clutches of an intensely uncomfortable thought. We might, for example, realise that we should leave our partner, that we are furious with someone we’re meant to love or that we need to try to find a different sort of work, though we have invested so much in the existing path. With such disclosures waiting for us, no wonder not-thinking can feel like such a priority; how understandable it is that we lean on opportunities for distraction in order to delay, possibly forever, the necessary moments of reckoning.</p>
<p>Yet the train understands our squeamishness and its toll, and has ingenious ways of assuaging us. If a pattern of thought grows difficult, we can evade its hold by glancing out towards the horizon at a row of trees, a bank of clouds or the path of an electricity line. Then as soon as the anxiety has dissipated, we can instantly pick up our rumination where we left off, always knowing we can pause again if it gets too much. Our attention can hover; we can be both within ourselves and lost in the ever-changing views — and in this condition of suspended presence, our better ideas have the freedom to emerge at last.</p>
<p>After hours of train-thinking, we may feel lightened, understood and purged of our previous anxiety and fear. The train’s claims have been too modest; it has not only carried us to our destination, but also led us back to key bits of ourselves.</p>
