        <h2>‘You’re disgusting, and you definitely don’t deserve compassion’</h2>
<p>One might at this point wonder where this inner critic comes from. There’s only one answer: an inner critic was always an outer critic who has been internalised. You’re speaking to yourself as someone else once spoke to you, or once made you feel. Stand back from this deranged, cruel lunatic and question what they are doing in your mind. Is that really a way to speak to anyone? You’re happy to acknowledge your failings, all of them, every single one; you’re happy to say sorry and atone and make enormous amends and accept what you have coming to you – but this? Does anyone deserve this? This critic just wants you to die – and they don’t have a right to walk unhindered, sledgehammer in hand, into the rooms of your mind.</p>
