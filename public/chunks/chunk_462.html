        <h3>Naps</h3>
<p>Kindly parents in charge of young children know full well the dangers of exhaustion: how quickly it can descend, how unaware one can be that it has and how terrible everything looks under its governance. A parent’s first thought, whenever there is a tantrum or hysteria, is whether it might be time to go upstairs, close the curtains and lie down for forty minutes. They will refuse to engage in a discussion about sweets or toys or trips, not because these aren’t legitimate topics, but because they know that so long as the mind has not rested, no good conclusions can ever be reached.</p>
<p>Wise adults should consider themselves as identical to 9-month-olds in this sense. We should not be interested in marathons of endurance. Rather, as soon as we notice our panic rising and latching on viciously to an ever-expanding array of topics, we must recognise what is going to happen – and know better than to try to think our way out of fear with only an exhausted brain for assistance. The wise adult is sufficiently committed to serenity to have a proper reverence for beds.</p>
