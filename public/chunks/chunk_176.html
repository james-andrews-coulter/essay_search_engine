        <h2>24.Travel and Pilgrimages</h2>
<p>Religions have shown a surprising degree of sympathy for our impulse to travel. They have accepted that we cannot achieve everything by staying at home. They’ve also taken travel very seriously, far more seriously than we do now; they’ve interpreted it as a major way to be healed.</p>
<p>In Christianity, the point of a pilgrimage was to visit a shrine of a long-dead saint and there beg for a cure for a variety of physical and mental ailments. Every ailment called for contact with a specific holy place, of which there were a confusing multitude scattered across Europe. France alone offered mothers having trouble lactating a choice of forty-six sanctuaries of Mary’s Holy Breast Milk (‘Had the Virgin been a cow,’ observed the sixteenth-century Protestant John Calvin unkindly, ‘she scarcely could not have produced such a quantity.’). Atlases of pilgrimages were like complex apothecaries: believers with a painful molar were advised to travel to Rome to the Basilica of San Lorenzo, where they would touch the arm bones of St Apollonia, the patron saint of teeth or, if such a trip were awkward, they might go and find pieces of her jaw in the Jesuit church at Antwerp, some of her hair at St Augustine’s in Brussels, or her toes at disparate sites around Cologne. Unhappily married women were directed to travel to Umbria to touch the shrine of St Rita of Cascia, patron saint of marital problems (and lost causes). Soldiers looking to embolden themselves before a battle could commune with the bones of St Foy in a gold-plated reliquary in the abbey church in Conques in southwestern France – while people who worried excessively about lightning could gain relief by travelling to the Jesuit church in Bad Muenstereifel in Germany and laying hands on the relics of St Donatus, believed to offer help against fires and explosions of all kinds.</p>
<p>Though we no longer believe in the divine power of journeys to cure toothache or gall stones, and though most of the problems motivating pilgrimages are now more appropriately addressed by a visit to a clinic, we can still hang on to the idea that certain parts of the world possess a power to address our ills. There are places that, by virtue of their remoteness, vastness, climate, chaotic energy, haunting melancholy or sheer difference from our homelands exert a capacity to salve the wounded parts of us. These sites, valuable rather than holy, help us to recover perspective, reorder our ambitions, quell our paranoias and remind us of the interest and obliging unexpectedness of life.</p>
<p>Though we intuit this at a general level, we lack, as yet, a tradition of approaching travel from a properly therapeutic perspective and so of analysing landscapes according to their benefits to our souls. We lack atlases of destinations with which to treat our worries and sorrows.</p>
<p>The Christian Church kept a tight grip both on where pilgrims went, and on what they did and thought about each day as they made their way there. It sought to buttress otherwise fleeting and forgettable sensations by giving pilgrims prayers and songs, it urged them regularly and publicly to rehearse their motives for travelling and it equipped them with distinctive garments to help them mentally separate themselves from their ordinary lives.</p>
<p>Medieval travel was slow at the best of times, but committed pilgrims went out of their way to make it even slower, forgoing the use of river barges or horses in favour of their own feet. A pilgrimage from northern Europe to the remains of St James the Apostle in Santiago could take eight months, pilgrims leaving in the spring and not making it back before the onset of winter.</p>
<p>Pilgrims were not being perverse in their insistence on slowness and difficulty. They were aware that one of our central motives for travelling is a desire to put the regrettable aspects of the past behind us, a desire explicitly recognised in the Christian notion of the pilgrimage as a penance. Furthermore, they knew that one of the most effective ways of achieving a feeling of distance from follies, vanity and sinfulness is to introduce something very large – like the experience of a month-long journey across a desert or a mountain range – between our past and our desired future. Our attempts at inner transition can be cemented by a protracted and hazardous progress. If inner change is difficult, then we may need a commensurately difficult outer journey to inspire and goad us.</p>
<p>Whatever the advantages of plentiful, swift and relatively convenient air travel, we may curse it for being, in the end, not painful or slow enough – and so for subverting our attempts to draw a convincing line under the past.</p>
<p>The travel industry should not be allowed to escape the underlying seriousness of the area of life it has been assigned to oversee. We need to relearn how to use travel as a way of being existentially healed, rather than merely entertained or tanned.</p>
