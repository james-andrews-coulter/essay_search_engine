        <h2>4.Anxiety</h2>
<p>A huge motive for travelling is the search for calm. But we should be modest about how calm we can ever be. We are, after all, human beings – creatures for whom serenity is not a native state.</p>
<p>A degree of anxiety is fundamental to our nature for well-founded reasons:</p>
<p>•   Because we are intensely vulnerable physical beings, a complicated network of fragile organs deeply affected by the vagaries of our outer and inner worlds.</p>
<p>•   Because we can imagine so much more than we can ever have and live in mobile-driven, mediatised societies where envy and restlessness are constants.</p>
<p>•   Because we are the descendants of the great worriers of the species (the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals) and because we still carry in our bones – into the calm of the jasmine-scented holiday resort – the terrors of the savannah.</p>
<p>•   Because we rely for our self-esteem and sense of comfort on the love of people we cannot control and whose needs and hopes will never align seamlessly with our own.</p>
<p>We should gently laugh at the challenges of relaxation. There is no need – on top of everything else – to be anxious that we are anxious. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we are alive.</p>
<p>We should be more careful when heading for destinations that we imagine will spare us every anxiety. We can go, but with a little more scepticism about our likely mood. It is rare to be uncomplicatedly happy for longer than fifteen minutes.</p>
