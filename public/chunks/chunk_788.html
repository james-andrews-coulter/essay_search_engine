        <h2>WORKING TO IMPRESS</h2>
<p>Our emotional difficulties with work tend to begin with the way that it apparently offers us an unparalleled chance to impress those who do not, or did not, originally believe in us. It is the favored tool of all those who start in life with a feeling of being under-loved, under-appreciated, and overlooked. It is the instrument of vengeance of the once-ignored. Under the guise of a merely practical pursuit, it carries a heavy emotional mission: it is the means by which we try to earn our right to be.</p>
<p>It may for a while seem to fulfill this purpose very well. Success can earn us preferment, a higher income, honor and fame, which can assuage our underlying sense that we are undeserving and shameful.</p>
<p>But the healing is only ever cosmetic, temporary, and subject to constant reversals. All success necessarily brings with it envy and criticism. The moment we have achieved a prominent position, dissenting voices will emerge to claim that we are illegitimate and unworthy, and thereby remind us of precisely the negative self-image we are pedaling so hard to outrun. We’ll be torn between listening to praise and focusing on the thread of denunciation—and the latter will be the only one that mesmerizes us.</p>
<p>No amount of success will be able to expunge our inner sense of baseness and unlovability. We may work monstrously hard, not because our material needs are so elevated but because we are only ever a few steps ahead of a chorus of inner voices telling us that we are futile and ludicrous.</p>
<p>Over time, we will fall prey to exhaustion. The source of our tiredness won’t be the work itself, it’ll be the constant effort to keep at bay a confrontation with our original lack of self-love. It’ll simply be too tiring to spend a whole life insisting through our labors that we are not bad people.</p>
