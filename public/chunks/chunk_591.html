        <h3>¶ Existential Angst</h3>
<p>We are frequently thrown into states of extreme anxiety by our need to make a choice between options, in situations where we lack the necessary information and cannot be certain of the future. We are in a state of what is known as Existential Angst.</p>
<p>At such moments, it pays to remember that the real choice is almost never between error and happiness but between varieties of suffering. This is the wisdom of the early 19th-century Danish Existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, summed up in a playful, but bleakly realistic and exasperated, outburst in his masterpiece, Either/Or:</p>
<p>Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it … Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.</p>
<p>We deserve pity – as does everyone else. We will make disastrous decisions, we will form mistaken relationships, we will embark on misguided careers, we will invest our savings foolishly and spend years on friendships with unreliable and disappointing knaves. But we can be consoled by a bitter truth: we have no better options, for the conditions of existence are intrinsically rather than accidentally frustrating.</p>
<p>There is, curiously, a persistent relief to be found in the knowledge of the inevitability of suffering. In the end, it is not darkness that dooms us, but the wrong sort of hope.</p>
