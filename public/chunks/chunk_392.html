        <h2>6. Going Solo</h2>
<p>If you do not know anyone you can ask directly about solo adventures, there is a wonderful range of books. Here are my top ten (although I have left out some favourites because
  I have already described them elsewhere in this book). Some are novels.</p>
<p>The Long Way by Bernard Moitessier (Doubleday, 1971). Moitessier was in many ways a natural ‘loner’, without any pejorative connotations. He was a French single-handed
  yachtsman and this book is an account of his non-stop solo circumnavigation. When he set out, it was as part of the first Golden Globe Race (which Robin Knox-Johnston won), at which point such a
  journey had never been accomplished, or even attempted. However, after about two-thirds of the journey, Moitessier decided that he did not want to win the race or even go back to Europe at all, so
  instead he just sailed on, completing another half-circuit until he reached Tahiti. The book is a lyrical, even mystical, account of the journey and the joys of solitude. It is worth noting that
  Moitessier was a very experienced and highly skilled sailor, and also a professional writer.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, 1719. This is fiction. It is also one of the great adventure stories of English literature, and is a profound meditation on solitude and both its
  positive and negative aspects. Of course, in the end Man Friday turns up and Crusoe is no longer alone. If you have only read one of the versions created for children you will be surprised.</p>
<p>Walden; or, Life in the Woods by Henry Thoreau, 1854. Henry Thoreau was an American radical thinker – with some fairly eccentric views on a number of subjects. He went to live
  alone in a tiny hut in a wood not far from Concord for two years, and wrote this major US classic about it. It is a joyful, rambling book, full of rich description, odd thoughts about life, a
  philosophy of freedom and a wonderful sardonic commentary on his contemporaries. It may well have inspired the whole movement towards confessional autobiography, and was also a forerunner of the
  ecology movement. If it does not lead you at the very least to be tempted to try a small taste of solitude, I can only feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>Sea Room by Adam Nicolson (Harper Collins, 2002). Nicolson’s father gave him three tiny islands off the west coast of Scotland called the Shiants. Here Nicolson traces their
  history and their ecology and the patterns of extraordinary and lonely lives lived on them. Although no one is actually ‘alone’ for very long, the islands themselves are so isolated and
  far away – not just in space but in atmosphere – that their very existence is somehow an adventure into solitude. Nicolson is a loving biographer and historian, and himself a visitor.
  Lovely and encouraging and hopeful.</p>
<p>Walking Home by Simon Armitage (Faber &amp; Faber, 2012). The poet Simon Armitage walked the Pennine Way alone in 2010, and this is the account of his journey. It is not an
  ‘adventure’ in the sense that some of the other books are – although he made it more challenging by travelling as a troubadour, singing for his supper in pubs and other places en
  route. But it is a glorious, thoughtful, touching book about some of the pleasures of solitude and the beauties of hill walking.</p>
<p>A Woman in the Polar Night by Christiane Ritter (trans. Jane Degras) (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1954). It probably is not very useful to include this book, because it is very hard to get hold
  of – but there are so few adventure stories by women, and she writes so extraordinarily well about polar solitude, that I am including it anyway.</p>
<p>Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household (1939, new edition, Orion, 2013). This classic thriller takes solitude to a new level. It is a great adventure story and an extraordinary meditation on
  solitude, freedom and survival. It is very exciting.</p>
<p>The High Lonesome: Epic Solo Climbing Stories, ed. John Long (Falcon Press, 1999). I don’t get it myself, not really; solo rock climbing and mountaineering scare rather than
  excite me. I first read this to try and understand. Nonetheless Long has collected some thrilling and thoughtful accounts from a range of individuals who do enjoy this high and giddy solitude and
  are reflective enough to try and explain why.</p>
<p>The Places in Between by Rory Stewart (Picador, 2004). Stewart walked across Afghanistan, alone, just after the Taliban had fallen. His book is an extraordinary mixture of politics,
  exploration, travel description and human endurance. It has an odd, rather endearing nineteenth-century feel about it – minimizing discomfort and danger, slightly self-mocking – and
  introduces a faithful hound. But he writes beautifully about places most of us will never go to. A real adventure.</p>
<p>A Voyage for Madmen by Peter Nichols (Profile, 2001). Nichols’s book gives a full account of all nine entrants to the 1968–69 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. There
  were nine entrants, and only one finished. It provides a genuinely thrilling study of a range of different responses to extreme solitude. Sadly there were no women entrants.</p>
<p>There are of course many other stories of lone rangers – by air and sea, in exotic places and nearer home. After you have read some you should be at least be willing to imagine a small
  adventure into solitude yourself.</p>
