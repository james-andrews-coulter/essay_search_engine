            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Roots of Adversity and the Nature of this Book</p>
<p>Everyone knows that life contains many adversities: we all experience loss, failure, disappointment, waste and pain in various different forms and ways. This is so obviously
  the case that we rarely reflect on why things are like this. But if we want to understand how we might respond constructively to adversity we would do well to start by thinking about why there is
  adversity in human life at all. Adversity is, I shall suggest, inevitable. There is nothing we can do to escape it wholly. But that, far from being a negative thought, is immensely liberating,
  because it allows us to gain a realistic perspective on ourselves and on what we can really do to make sense of, and turn to account, the adversity we experience in life.</p>
<p>Limited Resources</p>
<p>We who live in the developed world are extremely fortunate. In many ways, we live in a world of plenty and of opportunity. We do not, in general, have to worry about the
  availability of food and shelter, of medical services and of educational opportunities, though the absurdities of how we organize things ensure that such resources are much more unequally
  distributed than they might be. Nonetheless, we do not live in a world of limitless resources and human beings are normally manifestly in competition with each other for them – concrete
  resources like income and property, but also more intangible resources, such as fame, reputation, status and so on. We see such competition in the job or housing market, for example, and in our
  desire for career advancement. Further, we are extremely physically vulnerable creatures, whose bodies are very easily damaged. We often fail to acknowledge this, even though we know it, because,
  in general, we experience much better health than any human beings in history. But a visit to your local A&amp;E department will remind you just how vulnerable the human body is.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we naturally seek for ourselves, and for those about whom we care, the best possible conditions of security. We all seek to shore up our position in the world, and, although
  different individuals conceive of safety and security in somewhat different ways, our desire and need for them inevitably mean that we clash with others, because we are seeking pretty much the same
  things as others, under conditions of limited resources. In other words, we come up against adversity.</p>
<p>But human beings are not just physically vulnerable; they are deeply psychologically vulnerable as well. This vulnerability comes about partly because human desires and needs are potentially
  limitless, in the sense that they feed off each other and the world around them in such a way that human beings always seek more – more of what they have already, or more of something new.
  There are, in my view, reasons deep within human psychology why this is so. In particular, three ideas from the writings of Samuel Johnson seem to me to be especially useful in understanding this:
  the hunger of the imagination; the vacuity of life; and the craving for novelty.</p>
<p>The Hunger of the Imagination</p>
<p>The human mind, Johnson pointed out, is not a passive recipient of information from the outside. It does not neutrally register what is going on out there. On the contrary, it
  is an active force with a life of its own, energetic, febrile, forever in motion, like a kind of unruly or disruptive creature. It is intolerant of limitation and restraint, and seeks to expend
  itself. It lives very largely in the past and the future, reflecting on what has been and propelling itself onto potential plans, projects, ambitions and aims. It is, in short, hungry.</p>
<p>This hunger is expressed in the workings of the imagination. It is because we are imaginative creatures that we can construct ideas and images of what the future might be like, formulate plans,
  initiate change and so on. We can see how things could be different, and, in our hunger, we reach out to make things correspond to the image we have: it might be that we want to buy
  something, or travel somewhere, or visit a friend, or learn something new, or change career – and so on, in countless ways. But because the mind is so hungry we find that once we achieve our
  goal we remain hungry: we want more of the same, or something different – or, paradoxically, both. This is why Plato saw human beings as like leaky buckets: pour the water in and, rather than
  staying put, it will flow out of the bottom. We can never be ‘full’, in this sense, more than momentarily. Other thinkers have followed Plato, changing the metaphor, seeing us as on a
  treadmill of desire, forever turning round and never coming to a halt.</p>
<p>Of course, all this has a positive side: we are able to mould the future in away that other animals cannot, and we can secure ourselves in various ways against troubles and difficulties. But the
  profoundly disturbing aspect of the hunger of the imagination is that the experience of desire is always potentially traumatic: we have desires, but we are also caught up in them.
  They can pull us and tempt us in all kinds of ways, and can seem alien to us when they do so. They are ours; but we are also theirs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the hunger of the imagination is the source of many negative emotions and dispositions. For the imagination is the root of our capacity to compare ourselves with others, and, when we
  do so, we often suppose that they have something, or some things, that we do not have. This can give rise to envy, for example, or greed – emotions unpleasant to have in themselves and also
  highly likely to lead to various conflicts with others.</p>
<p>The Vacuity of Life</p>
<p>Because human beings are so hungry, they experience a kind of emptiness at the centre of their existence – just as they experience an emptiness in the stomach when they
  are hungry for food. Johnson called this ‘the vacuity of life’. Of course, individuals differ in how susceptible they are to such emptiness in psychological terms, and in how they cope
  with it, but we are all to a greater or lesser extent restless, constantly seeking to fill up our lives. The French philosopher Blaise Pascal famously expressed this by saying that the reason human
  beings are miserable is that they cannot remain quietly alone in a room. If they try to do this, they grasp acutely the vacuity of life, a sense of themselves as empty containers that cannot bear
  their own emptiness. Hence we crave distraction all the time. We need to fill up our time. From a very bleak perspective – Pascal’s, for example – all human activity is
  basically a form of distraction, an attempt to rid ourselves of a feeling of emptiness. But even if we do not see things in this way, it can hardly be denied that very many human activities are
  forms of distraction in Pascal’s sense.</p>
<p>Probably the best example of this self-distraction in the modern age is the use we often make of the technology by which we are surrounded – television, film, the internet, mobile phones
  and so on. Despite its usefulness in many contexts, this technology is immensely distracting. It fills up what would otherwise be empty time – that is, the sense of emptiness we experience
  – and then becomes an end in itself. This is just a way of saying that such technologies are immensely addictive. I see this, for example, in the case of my students, who invariably check
  their mobile phones for messages and calls as soon as the class has finished. Such technology gives them a sense of never being alone, of never having to face their emptiness. But that is certainly
  in large part an illusion.</p>
<p>In any case, we distract ourselves in many ways, and it may be that the problems of contemporary societies – drug and alcohol addiction, gambling, obesity, pornography and so on –
  are really attempts to fill the vacuity that haunts us.</p>
<p>Another way of putting this is to say that the world is indifferent to us. To become addicted to something is to seek to wrest something from the world, to make it respond to us, to strip it of
  its indifference. This is why those who are truly addicted to something feel, when indulging the addiction, that the world is theirs. But, of course, when the moment has passed, they feel
  even more acutely the indifference of the world – which feeds the addiction. We are not all addicts. But human beings are deeply addictive creatures. That is one manifestation of their need
  for distraction to fill themselves up.</p>
<p>We all of us have to do something with our time, and part of the problem of human life is finding worthy things to do – things that do not involve the expenditure of energy for
  its own sake but rather are constructive, or deepening, or nourishing. If you have ever rid yourself of a few hours by surfing the internet without even really realizing that this is what you were
  doing – and, at the end, could not much remember what you saw or honestly say that you found anything much worth thinking about – then you know exactly what I am talking about. And you
  also know what Pascal was seeking to express in speaking of human beings’ need for distraction.</p>
<p>The Craving for Novelty</p>
<p>Because we long to fill ourselves up, psychologically and spiritually, one of the things that haunts the human mind is boredom. Boredom is, at least in one of its forms, an
  unbearable sense of vacuity; it is the psychological manifestation of the sense of the vacuity of life. And one way in which we seek to evade boredom is by seeking out that which is new. We are
  afflicted, Johnson noted, by a craving for novelty. The French philosopher Albert Camus said that man can get used to anything. That may be true. But it is also true, and well known, that we can
  become bored by anything that at the outset we welcomed. In our age, the place where we see this most clearly is the consumerist market, where so much of what is bought is acquired not because what
  it replaces has worn out or become unusable, but simply because it has become familiar – in other words, we are bored by it. ‘Fashion’ is one term by which we dignify this aspect
  of our lives.</p>
<p>Psychological Mess</p>
<p>What all that adds up to is that human beings are deeply conflicted both within themselves and with others. They are psychologically messy in the ways I have sought to describe,
  and this generates conflict within and without – that is, intrasubjective and intersubjective conflict. Pained by a sense of emptiness, we inevitably clash with others as we
  seek the means to assuage our suffering.</p>
<p>I am saying nothing new: it has been said countless times since human beings started to think about the kinds of creatures they are. The great religions took these facts of the human condition
  deeply seriously, and sought ways in which their adherents might cope with and make sense of their suffering. Buddhism, for example, elaborated techniques of meditation and mindfulness, practices
  aimed at enabling us to learn to accept and thrive on the emptiness at the centre of human experience. Christianity, whose name for the restless condition I have described is ‘original
  sin’, did the same with prayer, which, in its best forms, has a purificatory function, and suggested that human beings can only finally achieve peace in the beatific vision of God after
  death, intimations of which are, nonetheless, available to us here in this world. One reason why many people in the modern age feel themselves to be spiritually bereft is that they can no longer
  really believe in the solutions such religions offer – this is part of what the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche meant by ‘the death of God’ – but the needs to which
  these religions ministered have not gone away.</p>
<p>Ontological Misfits</p>
<p>Because human beings know that they are psychologically messy, they devise techniques to seek to escape their condition as such. They invent ideals, seeking to transcend
  themselves. Christianity was one of the main such ideals in the West – and still is, for plenty of people – yet for many it is now unbelievable. But there are many other ideals:
  personal, ethical, political, aesthetic and so on. The basic distinction at work in an ideal is between how the world is and how it ought to be. And because we are part of the
  world, we subject ourselves to the kind of scrutiny in question: we are as we are, but seek to be what we ought to be, however we may conceive that.</p>
<p>But what this means is that we are seeking to escape our own condition, to transcend ourselves. Hence we can say: it is the nature of human beings to seek to escape their own
  condition, to long to be something else. This does not mean that all human beings are like this all the time, but it is to say that it is a feature of our fundamental, or ontological, condition:
  that is the kind of creature we are.</p>
<p>We are at odds with ourselves, and this is one of the things that distinguishes us from the other animals and why we can sometimes envy them their ability simply to be at home in the world.
  Traditionally, the view I am exploring has been expressed by saying that human beings are neither beasts nor angels, both of which are at peace with themselves, whilst we are not. We are
  ontological misfits. We are not at home in the world. And in my view that explains, in large part, why it is that human history is such a relentless, monstrous scene of suffering inflicted
  by human beings on themselves and each other: we flail around in our own wretched confusions, and as we do so we wound ourselves and those around us. In our attempts to escape our condition, to
  find something solid on which to rely, to make ourselves the stable thing we need, we seek to dominate ourselves and others, seek to gain control of things, and, in doing this, we invariably make
  things worse all round.</p>
<p>All well and good, you might say. If it is the nature of human beings to wish to escape their condition as human beings, and if this generates such adversity, then clearly what we need to do is
  to stop doing that and to accept ourselves in all our humanity. But that will not work since, obviously enough, to accept one’s nature as a human being just is to accept that it is
  one’s nature to seek to escape that. So either way is unsatisfactory: if you accept yourself, you will accept your longing to escape your condition, and therefore seek to do so; if you do not
  accept your condition as a human being then, similarly, you will seek to escape your condition. Either way, you are caught.</p>
<p>As I say, different individuals manifest these ontological tendencies to different degrees. But no one is wholly free of them. To suppose that would be to suppose that he or she had no sense at
  all of any way in which things ought to be other than as they are. And there is no one like that. No one thinks that the world is perfect, for only a person with no desires could think that –
  but that is to be dead.</p>
<p>Chance</p>
<p>One way to express much of what I have been saying is that our lives very largely escape our control and are a matter of chance, not choice. No one chooses to be born, or when
  and where to be born, or who his or her parents are, or what mother tongue he or she speaks. No one chooses his or her basic psychological proclivities and tendencies, or early formative
  experiences. Psychological patterns are largely laid down by the time one is old enough to start thinking about them, and seeking to channel or change them. Moreover, much of what happens to us as
  we pass through life is chance – it is chance, for example, that we meet particular people, or are subject to specific illnesses or difficulties. And because so much of what we are and what
  we experience is a matter of chance, we face the world as very weak creatures, exposed in all kinds of ways that can hurt or harm us. That is another way of expressing the point that we are
  physically, psychologically and ontologically fragile creatures. Indeed, it is probably in various forms of lack of control over our lives that we most acutely sense that fragility.</p>
<p>Adversity</p>
<p>The German philosopher Martin Heidegger expressed some such thought by saying that we are thrown into the world – and can never gain a wholly secure foothold. Put
  more prosaically, our reflections show us that adversity in human life is inevitable and can never be wholly escaped. This does not mean that we cannot devise strategies to reduce it or manage it
  better. But it does mean that one of the first things you need to do if you want to achieve this is to accept that your life will never be wholly free of adversity. In other words, you have to be
  realistic. This is not a counsel of despair. Quite the contrary. Being realistic about things is the first step towards changing them, and, even though things can never be wholly as we want them to
  be, we can certainly improve them.</p>
<p>This Book</p>
<p>That is what this book is about. I have explored four areas of life where we often experience adversity, aiming to show how adversity in these aspects of our existence can be
  dealt with more constructively. The areas I have taken are:</p>
<p>• The family. I have concentrated here mainly on how things look from the point of view of the child towards parents.</p>
<p>• Love. Here I have concentrated, amongst the many different forms of love, on romantic love, or eros.</p>
<p>• Illness. My approach here has been mainly to look at physical, rather than mental, illness.</p>
<p>• Death. In this chapter I have sought to explore both our fear of dying and our fear of death.</p>
<p>It will be immediately apparent that I could have chosen different approaches. For example, I might have explored the view parents have of their children, or sibling relations
  and rivalry. Again, there are aspects of death that I have left aside and not discussed, such as how to cope with the death of a loved one. And so on. But the aim has been to offer one central
  approach in each case, in the hope that enough detail can be given to provide some real, concrete reflection. Throughout I have drawn on philosophers and other thinkers to explore the topics in
  question. I have done so for many reasons, but principally because I believe that we can best make sense of our own struggles with adversity by seeing how others have done so in their lives. This
  is no substitute, of course, for our own reflection and our own attempts to clarify things, but it helps enormously.</p>
<p>So what I offer here are some suggestions about some aspects of the topics I broach. I aim to open up space for productive thinking on your part. Nothing I say is definitive, and you
  should test my advice against your own experience, feelings and thinking. But my hope is that, even if you reject some given suggestion I make, by articulating your reasons for disagreeing, you
  will be able to make better sense of the adversity in your life, thinking more constructively about it, and experiencing that adversity more insightfully.</p>
<p>No book can hope to have everyone as its intended audience – a point that Nietzsche made ironically when he subtitled Thus Spoke Zarathustra ‘a book for everyone and no
  one’. In the case of this book, my readership is suggested partly by the topics with which it deals, but also by the individuals – the philosophers and other thinkers – whose
  cases I discuss. These range from classical thinkers such as Seneca and Plutarch, to novelists such as Proust and Kafka, to contemporary writers such as John Updike. (I have given the sources of
  all quotations, and all translations are mine except where indicated). I do not, in general, much care whether a writer is classified as a philosopher or novelist or whatever, if what he or she has
  to say is worth listening to. We should get help in understanding our lives wherever we can.</p>
<p>I would, nonetheless, describe this as a book in therapeutic philosophy or philosophy as a way of life, because I seek in it to combine a level of reflection at a somewhat
  abstract level with detailed discussion of concrete cases, in the hope of providing material with which we can think more productively about our lives. This is why each chapter carries a title that
  points towards both the abstract and the concrete. There is an ancient and noble tradition of philosophy as therapy. This book intends to place itself in such a tradition.</p>
<p>In my view, philosophy is one of the ways of thinking of the human condition that can help us make better sense of it. People sometimes ask: What is the good of philosophy? What does it do? I
  would say that one answer is this: We all experience adversity in our life, in different ways and to different degrees. Inevitably we start to think about what sense we can make of this adversity.
  ‘Philosophy’ is, in part, just the name for that thinking when it is continued in a certain direction and in a certain style. To that extent, it is simply an extension of ordinary ways
  of thinking. In this book I hope to give you a few pointers to help extend your thinking in this way. If I have done that, then this book will have achieved its aim.</p>
