        <h3>¶ Service</h3>
<p>Service refers to the urge to devote ourselves to the well-being of others through our work. Few of us explicitly view ourselves as being concerned with service. We are encouraged to think that we are primarily selfish creatures. But what is striking is the extent to which what we actually require from our working days is a sense that we are able either to increase the pleasure or decrease the suffering of others through our labour. When this feeling is unavailable, no amount of money may be able to compensate – and when it is very present, not even a negligible income can distract us.</p>
<p>Some work fits the requirement for service with ease: the nurse and the cardiac surgeon are in no doubt that they are of service. But there are less dramatic yet equally essential forms of service-related satisfaction to be found in a range of less obvious tasks: sanding someone’s floor; making efficient toothpaste dispensers; clearing up the accounts; delivering letters; helping someone to improve their backhand.</p>
<p>When work is of service, we can trace a connection between the things we do and a modest but real contribution to the improvement of humankind. It would be rather simple if all we wanted from work was money. However, we want something far more ambitious and far more complicated: the feeling of having made a difference.</p>
