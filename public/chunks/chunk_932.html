        <h3>4. Idealism vs Realism</h3>
<p>The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be, and judges the current state of a relationship by the standard of a better imagined alternative. Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment and anger as they consider the compromises, the imperfect degree of closeness and times of frustration or distance. They can get furious with their partners for letting them down and surprised and outraged by evidence of petty selfishness, less than total frankness or any hint of sexual interests not wholly focused on them.</p>
<p>For their part, the Classical person doesn’t feel that ideal scenarios are worth much attention. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the ways relationships normally play out and may regard their union as bearable, under the circumstances. Their view of themselves and their partner is fundamentally rather dark. They believe that everyone is probably slightly more mixed up and selfish than they seem. They assume that both they and their partner (and anyone else they might conceivably have a relationship with in the future) will have some dangerous impulses, strange quirks of lust and coldness and hard-to-control drives. When bad behaviour manifests itself, they simply feel this is what humans are prone to. High ideals strike them as unhelpful.</p>
