        <h2>How to Live with Your Hamartia</h2>
<p>When we fail, part of what makes our fate harder to deal with than it needs to be is that we are operating with the idea that a person is essentially either ‘good’ or ‘bad’. We are stuck within a basic binary ethical paradigm – and sadly for us, we may become convinced that, because of what we have done, we are condemned to always be inherently and totally ‘bad’.</p>
<p>This is – one might add – the paradigm of children. It never occurs to small children that the adults around them might be a range of opposing things: good and bad, impatient and kind, loving and annoying. The perception of moral complexity belongs to the developing mind. It’s a feat of the imagination to be able to see that a good person may do a bad thing, that there may be a difference between what someone does and what they truly meant to do and that an impulse or compulsion is not the same as a reasoned stance.</p>
<p>It is another genius idea of the ancient Greeks that breaks us out of the good–bad paradigm. They insisted on two broad and helpful ideas: all of us mean well and are in that sense fundamentally good – but we are also beset by a multitude of hamartias. In this way, the Greeks arrived at a very subtle ethical stance: we are good, but broken.</p>
<p>This realisation helps us to tolerate ourselves. We certainly may have done and said some truly terrible things, but does this have to make us untenably awful people? No, because there is a difference between our being and our flaws. We are not our flaws. Our flaws shape our lives, but they are not the last word on everything we are. We exist outside of them, however ghastly they may be.</p>
<p>This generous philosophy gives us a little room for mental manoeuvre. We have to atone, we have to take responsibility, we have to despise what we have done and we have to apologise to those we have hurt. But we do not – in the end – have to be without kindness for ourselves.</p>
