        <h1>4. What’s the Story?</h1>
<p>I have included this section on stories because a part of every successful therapy is about re-writing the narratives that define us, making new meanings and imagining different endings. In the same way, part of staying sane is knowing what our story is and rewriting it when we need to.</p>
<p>Our usual emotional, cognitive and physical response to the world – that is, our typical pattern for dealing with recurrent situations – will come from our own stories. Our way of being in the world will also come from stories that we read and that are told to us, from films, sitcoms and the news; they might be family legends, or parables and metaphors, or religious tracts and fairy stories. We make up stories, we read stories, we hear stories. Our lives interweave these stories and respond to them.</p>
<p>Our minds are formed by narratives. We evolved using stories and narratives that are co-constructed. As our earliest caregivers transcribed our sensations, feelings and actions into words for us, our narratives took shape. We used these narratives to integrate our experience into coherent meanings. Children and their parental figures narrate their experience together and, in doing so, they organize their memories and put them into a social context. This assists in linking feelings, actions and others to the self. These co-constructed narratives19 are central to all human groups – from a family in the western world to the hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari Desert. The co-construction of story has negative and positive outcomes. The downside is that the parental figure can unduly influence the child with his or her own fears and anxieties, prejudices and restrictive patterns of being; but the upside is that co-forming narrative teaches ways of memorizing, as well as imparting positive values, group culture and individual identity. A child not only co-constructs the narrative of his or her life with his or her caregiver, but ideally listens to many other stories as well. We may think this is mainly just for entertainment and bonding, but the repeated telling of stories also helps to form structures in the child’s mind that enable problem solving, meaning making, optimism and self-soothing. Wicked witches get their comeuppance, conflicts are resolved and we learn the concept of ‘happily ever after’.</p>
<p>In the same way that stories are important in personality formation, they are also significant in the evolution of our species and the creation of culture. Before the invention of writing, stories, sagas and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions that contained both education and the foundations of wisdom. Just as new learning forges new neural pathways to what we already know, so a new story adds to our existing stock. The appearance of certain themes across cultures and times – death and resurrection, for instance – testifies to their importance to the species as a whole. Such stories are used to pass down group identity, wisdom and experience for the next generation to build on, as well as giving them ways of coping, self-soothing and facing death.</p>
<p>Stories may unconsciously influence us to act in one way or another, but they also enable us to think about ourselves in an objective way. When a client in therapy presents a problem, the therapist often asks them to imagine that problem belonging to a friend and, if that was the case, how they would counsel that friend. This use of storytelling helps us to gain some distance from ourselves and gives us perspective. We can also use stories to help us escape into our imaginations when there is no escape in reality. Children often create imaginary worlds where they can succeed and triumph. Though they may be limited in their choices in real life, they can use imagination and storytelling to soothe themselves during real-life experiences that might otherwise be intolerable. It is not only children who can do this. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl explained that while he lived through suffering, atrocity and imprisonment at Auschwitz and other concentration camps he created a place of freedom in his mind and imagination. He ascribes his survival to this act of defiance and hope.</p>
<p>The great thing about a story is that it is flexible. We can change a story from one that does not help us to one that does. If the script we have lived by in the past does not work for us anymore we do not need to accept it as our script of the future. For example, the belief that we are unworthy of being loved and belonging is just that, a belief. This belief, this story we tell ourselves, can be edited. The effects of such editing can be more positively life changing than winning the lottery. Research has shown that after winning the lottery people take about three months to return to the mindset they had before the win. So, if they were generally optimistic and joyful, that’s where they return to; and if they were self-loathing and misanthropic, they will be after their win as well. A lot of money does not change our emotional life. The way we talk to and about ourselves and the way in which we edit our own stories, can and does.</p>
<p>Creating a consistent self-narrative that makes sense and feels true to ourselves is a challenge at any stage in life. Our stories give shape to our inchoate, disparate, fleeting impressions of everyday life. They bring together the past and the future into the present to provide us with structures for working toward our goals. They give us a sense of identity and, most importantly, serve to integrate the feelings of our right brain with the language of our left.</p>
<p>Sophie was a fifty-year-old woman who came to see me. She interpreted her life story to mean that she was washed up and on the scrap heap, because ‘it’s a young person’s world’. This worried me because people who interpret events in pessimistic ways are more likely to become depressed and ill, and live shorter lives than those who find positive meanings. Together we worked with her statement, not by arguing about whether it was true or untrue, but by examining how it made her feel and whether further meaning or meanings would not be more helpful. Sophie had just finished a fine-art degree and was finding it tough-going locating places to show her work. I told her a story (more of a myth – I do not even know if it’s true) about a telephone-systems salesperson who made a very different kind of sense of rejection. Every time this salesperson was rejected by a prospective customer he was delighted, because it brought him one encounter nearer to his next sale. He calculated his hit-rate as one in fifty cold calls, so if he counted forty rejections he began to get excited, as he knew the sale would be coming soon. This made him more confident. He did very well and won the firm’s salesman-of-the-year award. Sophie laughed at the story but it stayed with her and gave her the confidence to tell people that she really wanted to be selected for an artist’s residency. When a residency did come her way, she told me, ‘I did not have to approach anywhere near fifty people. It was more like seventeen. Holding the story in mind kept me enthusiastic when I talked about my work and what I had to offer.’ By telling her story in a different way Sophie changed it, and that in turn changed the way she appeared to others.</p>
<p>We are primed to use stories. Part of our survival as a species depended upon listening to the stories of our tribal elders as they shared parables and passed down their experience and the wisdom of those who went before. As we get older it is our short-term memory that fades rather than our long-term memory. Perhaps we have evolved like this so that we are able to tell the younger generation about the stories and experiences that have formed us which may be important to subsequent generations if they are to thrive.</p>
<p>I worry, though, about what might happen to our minds if most of the stories we hear are about greed, war and atrocity. For this reason I recommend not watching too much television. Research exists that shows that people who watch television for more than four hours a day believe that they are far more likely to be involved in a violent incident in the forthcoming week than do those who watch television for less than two hours per day.20 Not only does Hollywood supply a succession of movies in which the ‘goodies’ win by resorting to violence rather than dialogue, but even the news appears to be filtered for maximum emotional shock value, which means it has a bias towards bad news rather than good. Be careful which stories you expose yourself to. I am not saying it is not important to be informed about what is going on, but to be informed repeatedly about bad news will give us neither a balanced view of our world nor of the other people who inhabit it. In contrast to this torrent of bad news, I think it is important to seek out optimistic stories and foster the optimism within ourselves.</p>
<p>I am going to try to convince you that optimism is a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies show that pessimism in early adulthood appears to be a risk factor for poor physical and mental health later on.21</li>
<li>Optimism is shown to correlate with physical and mental good health.</li>
<li>Optimistic people recover more quickly after operations and have higher survival rates after cancer. (They are more likely to follow their doctor’s orders and so aid recovery.)</li>
<li>Optimism puts you in a better mood and thereby decreases stress.</li>
<li>Optimism is correlated with longevity while pessimism is associated with a reduced life span.22</li>
<li>Optimists are more likely to trust others and therefore enjoy more satisfying relationships.</li>
<li>Pessimists think they are cleverer than optimists but they really aren’t.23
If I walk into a party with my head held high, with the optimistic attitude that everyone is pleased to see me or would like to meet me (and I them), I will catch someone’s eye even if, hitherto, everyone in the room was a stranger to me. I will ask them about themselves and they may ask me about myself; we will probably find some common ground and I might learn something from them as a bonus. But more than that, I give myself the chance of forming what feels like a connection. It might last just a few minutes, or it may be the beginning of a long friendship, but in that connection I feel deeply nourished.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, on the other hand, I walk into a party with my eyes on the ground, neither interested in meeting anyone nor thinking that anyone would be interested in meeting me, I will not catch anyone’s eye and I will not enjoy the party. I will be thinking about ways to leave it. I will not be fully present at the party. Instead I will be present only with my prejudices; I will be projecting a fantasy, or an experience of the past, onto the present, and relating to that, instead of to what is going on around me.</p>
<p>The party is life. Sometimes, I confess, I enter the party in a state nearer the second scenario than the first and sometimes in spite of this somebody is still generous enough to make an effort with me and bring me round. Part of the story I tell myself is that if I am down, other people make me feel better.</p>
<p>What I have displayed here, even in my confessional paragraph above, is optimism. Whether optimism becomes established as a result of good things happening or, conversely, good things happen because they are visualized, hoped for, worked for and obtained, I do not know. But the meanings you find, and the stories you hear, will have an impact on how optimistic you are: it’s how we evolved.</p>
<p>What happens if we never hear positive stories? How would it have affected your brain if you had never heard a ‘happy ever after’ story? If you do not know how to draw positive meaning from what happens in life, the neural pathways you need to appreciate good news will never fire up. Here is a story. A social worker who works with children was working with a family of three siblings aged six, eight and twelve. They had known only their own unsafe home, care homes and foster families all their lives. Their most recent placement was working out extraordinarily well. They had been placed in foster care with a couple, Brianna and Simon, who were empathetic towards the children and gave them some stability. They listened to what the children said, and were good at interpreting the children’s feelings and able to provide them with support and loving care. My friend spent some time with them all and wrote her report recommending that the arrangement continue. The children were anxious about the meaning of her visit, so, contrary to usual procedures, she told them what she had written in her report. She said, ‘You will not be split up. You are going to stay with Brianna and Simon. We are going to find local schools for you all and, as Brianna and Simon want to adopt you, we are going to begin that process.’ The children were silent and seemed stunned, so my friend asked, ‘What did I just say?’ Each child said, ‘We will be split up; we can’t stay with Brianna and Simon; there aren’t any schools for us and no one will adopt us.’ My friend then repeated what she had said, and again the children could not hear it. She tried again and then the youngest child burst into tears. ‘Why are you crying, Robbie?’ she asked and Robbie replied, ‘I think it is because I am so happy.’ Eventually they all understood, but found it hard to take in.</p>
<p>The trouble is, if we do not have a mind that is used to hearing good news, we do not have the neural pathways to process such news. If we are in this situation we are probably unaware of it, because it is not as though we hear good news and do not trust it. Rather, it is as though we cannot hear good news as good news at all.</p>
<p>How easily do you absorb good news? If good stuff does happen to you, does it make you afraid in any way? Do you perversely comfort yourself by telling yourself it cannot last? If this is the case and if you were to begin to direct your mind to open itself to more optimistic ways of thinking you would probably experience a lot of head chatter telling you to stop. Note the head chatter, expect it and do not let it put you off. We need to point ourselves in the direction of listening for good news. Start a habit of looking for the positives in any situation, however dire. It will feel phoney at first. Often new behaviours feel false because they are unfamiliar; but an optimistic outlook is no more false than always assuming that nothing good will ever happen.</p>
<p>It is not easy simply to turn optimism on. It will take more than deciding that optimism sounds like a good idea. It will take practice and good people around us. You will need to keep up the practice of focused-attention exercises so you can pump up the neural pathways that can steer the mind. You may find that you have been telling yourself that practising optimism is a risk, as though, somehow, a positive attitude will invite disaster and so if you practise optimism it may increase your feelings of vulnerability. The trick is to increase your tolerance for vulnerable feelings, rather than avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>If we practise more optimism, disasters will still happen – but predicting disasters does not make them more tolerable, or ward them off.</p>
<p>At one time, when we went away for weekends, I would be quite low for the last thirty minutes or so of the journey home. I used to imagine that our house had been burgled. I pictured myself ringing the police, getting the broken window boarded up, ringing the insurance company. When I opened the front door, however, I would be delighted and relieved that it had not happened. When I began to practise self-observation, and noticed the fantasies I was having and the stories I was feeding myself, I decided to focus on other things when that particular fantasy visited me, and I was able to minimize the habit. When I got this pessimistic theme under control, I noticed that I not only enjoyed the last thirty minutes of the journey home more, but also the whole weekend. Only when I changed the story did I realize that my fantasy had been a cloud over the whole weekend. Sometimes we only realize that we have been living under a cloud when the cloud is lifted.</p>
<p>Optimism does not mean continual happiness, glazed eyes and a fixed grin. When I talk about the desirability of optimism I do not mean that we should delude ourselves about reality. But practising optimism does mean focusing more on the positive fall-out of an event than on the negative. It does not mean denying that you feel sad that, say, a relationship has not worked out, but rather acknowledging that you are now in a position to have a more successful relationship in the future. I am not advocating the kind of optimism that means you blow all your savings on a horse running at a hundred to one; I am talking about being optimistic enough to sow some seeds in the hope that some of them will germinate and grow into flowers.</p>
