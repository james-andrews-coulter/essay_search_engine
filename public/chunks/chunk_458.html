        <h2>Fear and Paranoia</h2>
<p>There’s a certain mood which, when it takes over us, can cause us to become increasingly scared of being on the receiving end of hostility from other people: it feels as if someone may imminently want to shout at us or say mean things about us. In this state of mind, when we leave a room, we imagine that everyone inside is hating on and mocking us. We picture gossip being exchanged about us online and off. We grow afraid of enemies who may want to seize our advantages and ruin things for us. We don’t necessarily have a firm grip on where the danger lies or who exactly will damage us; we simply suspect that there is something looming. In response to this eerie sensation, we may proffer, in a joking tone, that we’re feeling a bit ‘paranoid’ at the moment – but there is nothing to laugh at. We are being slowly crippled by worry.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce our apprehensions at these times, we should begin in an unusual place: with the hunch that we have problems with anger. The truth is that we are probably the sort of individual who has a great deal of difficulty confronting people who frustrate or damage them. We are unlikely to be emotionally well equipped for showdowns. We dare not speak out when others stymie our plans or bully us subtly. We might stay in relationships far longer than we should – if leaving would mean upsetting someone by whom we are privately rather intimidated. At work, we may remain endlessly stuck in unsatisfactory positions, unable to build up the courage either to quit or to fight for a promotion.</p>
<p>Our paranoid sensations are, arguably, the poisonous legacy of unexpressed anger. We acquire a general fear that other people will be hostile to us after having, at another time, failed to express ourselves with sufficient force and directness to a specific set of people who angered or harmed us. Paranoia is nothing more than repressed rage at other people, redirected against ourselves. It is as if a certain amount of anger is circulating in our system, seeking a way out, and when it can’t find its intended target, it doesn’t merely disappear, it builds up pressure and eventually ends up diverted towards the one subject who is handily close by and who won’t complain: us.</p>
<p>Our difficulties confronting people are liable to have begun in childhood with a parent who was unable to take the slightest expression of frustration or rage. They might have been so terrifying that we never dared to raise an objection to anything they said or wanted. Instead we nodded meekly in assent to every one of their suggestions – and watched in terror as they screamed or smashed up our bedroom. Or, perhaps our caregiver appeared so fragile to us that we did our best never to contradict them; maybe they complained that we would ‘be the end of them’ if we caused any sort of bother. We may have heard them declaring that they would kill themselves if things got too much.</p>
<p>But however much we might long to smile and please (both then and now), it will be impossible not to be angry and frustrated on regular occasions. Constant meekness is only ever a front; we all have wishes that go against those of others. We all need the opportunity to make a stand. The question is where the anger goes when it can’t be shown. In childhood, a rage that we can’t vent in front of our parents might come back at us in the form of an intense fear that we are about to be attacked by wild animals: we have to check under the bed numerous times just to make sure that there is no pack of hyenas or pride of lions hiding there. Later on, in adulthood, the fear may emerge as a form of political paranoia, wherein anger intended for a parent takes the form of a conviction in the mendacity and nastiness of an ideology or leader. Alternatively, rage at a spouse in a cold marriage might give rise to virulent misogyny or misandry. In diverse ways, anger that is intended for someone else always comes back to damage us.</p>
<p>With this mechanism in mind, if we find ourselves growing ever more fearful of particular people or dynamics, rather than continuing to ruminate (or seeking to reassure ourselves about lions or politicians), we would do well to change the subject completely and ask ourselves a possibly surprising-sounding question: ‘Is there anyone relatively close to home, now or in the past, with whom we are unconsciously very, very angry?’</p>
<p>It’s probable that rather than a right- or left-wing conspiracy to ‘get us’, there is a parent whom we are very disappointed by. Or instead of a feminist or masculinist movement that wants to do us ill, there is a spouse we can’t stand for a moment longer. Taking apart our paranoia will make the world at large feel much safer than it did, but it will also place the onus on us to do something we have resisted for too long: realise that we have the right to complain, that other people won’t be able to harm us if we do and that we should dare to speak – with courage and politeness – lest meekness ends up destroying us.</p>
