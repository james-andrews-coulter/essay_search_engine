        <h2>FACING ANXIETY</h2>
<p>One of the stranger aspects of feeling anxious is that we can be both suffering and markedly uninclined or unable to acknowledge that we are in fact so. We know of course that something isn’t quite right, but a kind of bravery or pride keeps us running forward, unable to square up to the problem. It’s as if, somewhere in our thoughts, we worry that looking at our anxiety directly will bring us harm: slow us down, cause us pain, or just be of no use.</p>
<p>It helps to note that our minds can easily carry more than one mood. They are like movie theaters with a variety of screens; there tends to be a foreground and a background to our emotional horizon in which very different things may be happening. In the foreground, we might—on a given day—be focused on achieving certain practical goals. Things might be fast-paced and relentless. We might keep opening tabs, scanning the diary, looking up emails—and diverting ourselves with glimpses at the news.</p>
<p>But then at another level, further back in the emotional sky, there might be something vast, eerie, and confused, a black sun we can’t quite see or touch and yet also can’t escape from. It tracks us everywhere; it is never not present but it doesn’t ever clarify itself into anything with borders. If it had a soundtrack, it might be made up of distant bellowing occult horns. If it were a color, it might be a hazy dark burgundy and brown. If it were made of words, it would be about fear and doom.</p>
<p>It isn’t, of course, very pleasant to be bearing this sort of diffuse anxiety within us. But we are not powerless before it and the way to defeat it is, paradoxically, to engage with it more directly than we probably have to date. Doing so is both easy and hard. Practically speaking, it requires nothing more than a few questions, questions which sound—at one level—utterly banal in their simplicity. But though such simplicity can be an insult to our pride, we should never do ourselves the injustice of assuming that our misery rests on something overly complex at a procedural level. We are sometimes like a high-powered aeroplane that can be grounded because a small screw is missing. We should be humble in the face of the ostensibly simple things that can ruin our lives.</p>
<p>With this caveat, we should step outside the ordinary flow of the anxious day for a moment, close our eyes, take a deep breath and ask ourselves this: What am I really worried about right now?</p>
<p>If we let the question resonate for a time, allowing its true profundity to emerge, we stand to find that, waiting until we have quietened the noise, there is a pain we knew all along, looking up at us with startled, wise eyes, like those of a tortoise we find hiding beneath a car or a fox burrowed in a corner of the garden.</p>
<p>We can continue the questioning: Why is this thing so worrying?</p>
<p>And then: What could I tell myself to make this less bad?</p>
<p>And finally, we can ask ourselves to complete a sentence: I feel compassion for myself because . . .</p>
<p>It sounds so simple and it takes only a few minutes, but it can decisively change the internal weather. Our minds are not obvious to themselves. We may be running for days, months, decades even, without pausing to wonder what is really the matter. We have so much misplaced composure, it can be dreadful to realize how fragile and scared we have been all along. We need to create a small safe place in which we can ask ourselves some basic questions—and whisper to ourselves what we are truly finding difficult.</p>
