<p>James Friel is a novelist. His most recent book, The Posthumous Affair, was published by Tupelo Press in 2012. He teaches creative writing at Liverpool John Moores
  University. He lives alone.</p>
<p>In the third and fourth centuries thousands of Christians went off to be hermits in the desert – mainly in the Egyptian desert, but also in Sinai, in what is now Syria and in Jordan. It
  was perhaps the first large-scale experiment in being alone that we have any record of. These hermits are often called the Desert Fathers, although some of them were women. They were quite
  experimental – trying out a variety of forms of prayer, ways of supporting themselves, ascetic disciplines and lifestyles. They had enormous influence on subsequent Christianity, because
  monasticism, as it developed in the West, was based on their practices. As they were much admired by their contemporaries, their stories and reflections were collected in several different books.
  Anyone worried about solitude and sanity should read some of these ‘sayings’, as they are called. The most admired of these hermits tend to be gentle, generous, humble, kind and
  slightly self-mocking. There are many translations of these originals. I particularly like the tone of Helen Waddell’s 1936 The Desert Fathers (Constable).</p>
<p>There are a number of biographies of Greta Garbo, perhaps the most famous ‘loner’ in modern history. The most recent is by David Bret – Greta Garbo: Divine Star
  (Robson Press, 2012).</p>
