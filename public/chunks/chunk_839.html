        <h2>THE WIDER CONTEXT OF OUR SORROW</h2>
<p>When a lover leaves us, we are acutely aware of the uniqueness of our pain. But, in the interests of soothing our agonies, it may serve us well to remember the connection between heartbreak and other forms of dereliction.</p>
<p>In one way or another, loss is everywhere; it is the ubiquitous experience of all members of our species – and to keep this in mind is to connect our lonely sorrow with the griefs of humanity more broadly. Hearts are continuously being broken in so many ways by reality.</p>
<p>The world is made of heartbreak, so when we meet rejection in love we’re plunged not only into our own private sorrow, but into the fundamental agony of the human condition. We are miserable, but we are also strangely glorious: because we are, at least for a while, alert to the essential woe of life. We are entering – ideally – into communion with the widest and deepest examples of loss.</p>
<p>At its best, our suffering renders us more compassionate because it draws us closer to the hidden truth of all people: To live is to suffer. Our pain stops being purely personal and becomes a tender lament for the imprecisely known, but utterly real, sorrows of strangers.</p>
<p>Hearts are continuously being broken…The fact that everyone who once lived in this photo is now dead.</p>
