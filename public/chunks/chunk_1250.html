        <h2>The Airline Seat</h2>
<p>It’s a very restricted place indeed. On some aircraft, it might not allow us more than a few millimetres of movement. If we are lucky, in the favoured parts of a modern cabin, we might be able to stretch out our legs and turn over onto our sides. Yet even the most expensive seat in the house won’t be remotely as comfortable as a sofa at home.</p>
<p>Engineers with years of experience have carefully positioned struts and bracing elements across our backs; cloth woven from the hardiest synthetic fibres has been stretched over fire-retardant pads; electric cables have been threaded within precisely milled aluminium sections to provide for light, sound and power; tiny motors have been concealed within footstools and headrests. It’s a singular kind of throne on which we are travelling around the planet — and, even when our neighbour begins to snore next to us as we cross over the Andaman Sea, it is a far more stately and elaborate affair than anything on which Charlemagne or Montezuma II ever had the privilege to sit.</p>
<p>The last time we were in anything as cosy and well thought through was, of course, when we lay in a pram — though the connection understandably tends to be downplayed. The chief parallel is that we cannot really move and have abdicated all responsibility. Once we used to lie back on a pillow or a rolled-up blanket and stare up at the passing clouds and the occasional intense face of a well-wisher. There were the rooflines of houses and the flights of seagulls to study. Occasionally we might have been uncomfortable and screamed, but much of the time, we were simply awed by the change of scenery; our horizons had expanded immeasurably since we exchanged the nursery ceiling for this open-air spectacle.</p>
<p>A similarly passive somnolence might descend on us in our airline cot. At first, we might have felt restless and desperate and wondered how we would get through eight hours of this. Now, though, we are a third of the way through and oddly and pleasantly anaesthetised. We’re even rather looking forward to the meal. Of course we could get far better things on the ground — bigger plates, fresher portions — but we would have to move and make decisions and it wouldn’t be so neatly arranged and intricately planned. Here everything comes automatically, as when we were ill long ago and someone loving came into our room with a tray. There is something reassuring about the uniform, mechanised nature of the offering: the immaculately arranged rectangular plates, the toy cutlery and the chilled, perfectly round bread roll.</p>
<p>Down below, we struggle in vain to assert our distinctiveness; up here, we’re clearly only 34J and it no longer feels insulting to be so. Why protest at the diminution of our individuality when there are particular pleasures involved, as there are in a care home, a kindergarten or the better kind of prison? It’s the sense that others know more clearly than us what we should have, and that we should just cede our will to them. Daddy and Mummy are up at the front, sending news of our flight path on AF13 to Dar es Salaam and Kigali (checking the hydraulic pressure on the EICAS and adjusting the trim), while we quietly eat our crackers and inspect the cheesecake, and try to be good.</p>
<p>We are normally oppressed by options. There are so many places we might go and initiatives we might set into motion; it’s never clear that we have done enough. But now we are strapped in and — for a few hours — nothing at all is expected of us. We can do nothing; we can hardly move our heads. It may sound unpleasant, but having very few options and letting others steer us can, in some circumstances, be tantamount to liberation.</p>
