        <h3>4. When we are happy to be taught and calm about teaching</h3>
<p>We are ready for love when we accept that, in certain very significant areas, our partners will be wiser, more reasonable and more mature than we are. We should want to learn from them. We should bear having things pointed out to us. We should, at key points, see them as the teacher and ourselves as pupils. At the same time, we should be ready to take on the task of teaching them certain things and, like good teachers, not shout, lose our tempers or expect them simply to know. Relationships should be recognised as involving a process of mutual education.</p>
