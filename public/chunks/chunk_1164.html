        <h2>THE WEDDING NIGHT</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, tradition has encouraged the idea that the night of the wedding should be filled with heroic sex. This might happen, but there are plenty of reasons why it probably won’t after the drama of the wedding and a long party and partly, as well, because stringent expectations are alien to sexual intensity.</p>
<p>But the idea that sex is crucial is obviously not wrong, and the basic motive is right: the first night should be devoted to helping the couple with their sex life.</p>
<p>The question is how to do this. The assumption has been that great sex is the goal. But realistically what the married couple is preparing for is a life together in which sex will often be less than great and in which – increasingly over the years – sex will fade from view almost entirely. Instead of being spontaneous, inventive, impassioned and constant, sex will almost inevitably end up being intermittent, guarded and fraught.</p>
<p>This isn’t a lovely prospect; it’s just what is very likely to happen. And the couple will have to cope with it, if their marriage is to be bearable. At this great symbolic moment – in the special night after the wedding – a couple should ideally make a series of vows around the attitudes they will try to adopt towards sex.</p>
