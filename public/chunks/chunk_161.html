        <h2>9.The Pleasure of the Airport</h2>
<p>The problem with the airport is that we tend to go there when we have a plane to catch. As a result, we are panicked, argumentative, stressed and entirely unable to notice that we’re passing through one of the most rewarding and interesting zones of the modern world. We should make it a destination in its own right.</p>
<p>There are the beginnings of a thousand novels all around the departure lounge. Some of the trips commencing here will have been decided upon only in the previous few days, booked in response to a swiftly developing situation in the Munich or Milan office; others will be the fruit of three years of painful anticipation of a return to a village in northern Kashmir, with six dark-green suitcases filled with gifts for young relatives whom one has not yet met.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the airport’s appeal more concentrated than in the television screens placed at intervals across terminals, which announce, in unromantic fonts, the itineraries of aircraft about to take to the skies. The screens imply a feeling of infinite and immediate possibility: they suggest the ease with which we might impulsively approach a ticket desk and, within a few hours, embark for a country where the call to prayer rings out over shuttered whitewashed houses, where we understand nothing of the language and where no one knows our identities. The lack of detail about the destinations serves only to stir unfocused images of nostalgia and longing: Rome, Tripoli, Nice, St Petersburg, Miami, Muscat via Abu Dhabi, Algiers, Kiev, Grand Cayman via Nassau – all of these destinations are like enemies of despair, to which we might appeal at moments of claustrophobia and stagnation, when home has become too much.</p>
<p>We forget how extraordinary and peculiar air travel can be. Yesterday we had chicken inasal for lunch at a crowded open air stall in the humid heat by the Guimaras Strait, and later this morning we’ll be sat at gate 42 at Heathrow eating a bacon and egg roll while we wait for our connecting flight to Glasgow, where it’s currently -2°C.</p>
<p>Arrivals can be hellish, of course, but despite the exhaustion, your senses are on fire, registering everything – the light, the signage, the skin tones, the metallic sounds, the advertisements – as if you were on drugs or a newborn baby – or Tolstoy. It is like being reborn. How peculiar this morning light seems against the memory of dawn in the Obudu hills. How unusual the recorded announcements after the wind in the High Atlas.</p>
<p>We should never give up this perspective. We should want to keep in mind everything we’ve learnt of alternative realities, as we have seen them in Tunis or Hyderabad, Lima or St Gallen. We should never forget that nothing here is normal, that the streets are different in Valletta and Luoyang, that this is only one of many possible worlds.</p>
<p>Despite its (often well-deserved) appalling reputation, the airport is – in its own way – trying to teach us a range of very important things.</p>
