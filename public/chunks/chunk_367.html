        <h4>2. How We Got Here</h4>
<p>I am convinced that we need to explore how we have arrived in this odd situation where we are so frightened of being alone that we aggress, or even apparently hate, those who
  want to be alone. We refuse, as a society, to extend to them the normal tolerance of difference on which we pride ourselves elsewhere. We stigmatize them. We deny their capacity to identify their
  own emotions. We fret if we do not have 24/7 social connection with others; we go to bizarre lengths to acquire partners (even though we then get rid of them with increasing frequency). I have
  already said that I believe that fear is at the root of many people’s deep unease about, or even terror of, being alone. I want to go further now, and argue that the roots of this fear lie in
  a very deep cultural confusion. For two millennia, at least, we have been trying to live with two radically contrasting and opposed models of what the good life would or should be.</p>
<p>Culturally, there is a slightly slick tendency to blame all our woes, and especially our social difficulties, either on a crude social Darwinism or on an ill-defined package called the
  ‘Judaeo-Christian paradigm’ or ‘tradition’. Apparently this is why, among other things, we have so much difficulty with sex (both other people’s and our own); why
  women remain unequal; why we are committed to world domination and ecological destruction; and why we are not as perfectly happy as we deserve. I, for one, do not believe this – but I do
  believe that we suffer from trying to hold together the values of Judaeo-Christianity (in as much as we understand them) and the values of classical civilization, and they really do not fit.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire reached its largest territorial extent under the Emperor Trajan, who reigned from AD 98–117. At this point it comprised most of what is now Western
  Europe and some of Eastern Europe and the whole Mediterranean basin. It was a highly efficient state which spread its cultural and technological influence, as well as its military organization, to
  its conquered territories. One of the reasons for its success was its unusually cohesive culture, which was based in its original republican ethos of patriotism, citizenship and civic
  responsibility. Even after the Republic collapsed in 27 BC, when Augustus Caesar became Emperor, these values remained central.</p>
<p>This value system was underpinned by laws which forbade the patricians (the upper classes) to be involved in commerce – this meant that little of their energy could go into
  ‘business’ or the accumulation of personal wealth through private or entrepreneurial activities. The young male Roman patrician was educated almost entirely for public office, with a
  curriculum consisting of rhetoric (public speaking), Roman traditions and public affairs. Such a youth grew up believing that the route to personal ‘fulfilment’ lay in public life,
  structured through the cursus honorum (literally ‘the course of offices’), a sequence of elected roles or ‘jobs’, which began with serving as an officer in the army
  and went on through a variety of legal and ceremonial duties up to provincial governor. Although (a bit like the President of the USA) having a lot of money helped you to get elected, you still had
  to charm the voters. The successful Roman was therefore a public and social figure: that was the ideal. (The word honorum originally meant simply ‘public office’, but you can
  easily see the connection with the concept of honour. This crossover is still apparent in contemporary Britain in phrases like ‘the New Year’s honours list’: where public
  recognition and status is given to people who are deemed to have performed public services.)</p>
<p>Private morality, interiority and personal ‘fulfilment’ score rather low in such a culture. Honour meant service to the state, the holding of elected public offices. An honourable
  person – though in Roman society this exclusively applied to men– was judged through his standing in the eyes of other people. His first moral duty was the appropriate
  ‘performance’ of the self in public – generosity, self-control, being law-abiding and a good public speaker were among the necessary qualities. The judgement of your fellow
  citizens was the measure of your worth. Even bathing was a social event. You were not privately clean, you had to be seen to be clean by your fellow citizens; perhaps unsurprisingly, nudity seems
  to have carried unusually little shame or embarrassment in Roman culture.</p>
<p>‘In men of the highest character and noblest genius there is to be found an insatiable desire for honour, command, power and glory,’ wrote Cicero – a man who himself
  represented and articulated these highest Roman ideals. Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BC) was a statesman, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul and
  constitutionalist. He was also a major intellectual, and introduced Romans to Greek philosophy, which further emphasized the social virtues.</p>
<p>Although we now think of Greek philosophy as highly abstract, disembodied and rarefied, it concluded that human nature was essentially social and communal. Aristotle wrote: ‘It is strange
  to make the supremely happy man a solitary, since man is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others.’</p>
<p>The very word ‘civilization’ comes from the Latin word civis which meant a citizen, just as the words ‘polite’ and ‘political’ come from
  polis, the Greek word for ‘city’.</p>
<p>But even as this culture reached its greatest height, the Mediterranean world saw the extremely fast rise of a ‘new’ religion, Christianity, which broke out from its Jewish roots and
  expanded across the Empire. Christianity proposed a set of values almost directly in opposition to the Roman one. They were distinctly unimpressed by Cicero’s ‘insatiable desire for
  honour, command, power and glory’. In fact they were initially sublimely indifferent to politics altogether, since they believed the world was going to end soon and that what mattered was
  preparing oneself for the immediate return of the Lord Jesus and an apocalyptic final judgement. Their core values focused around a personal (interior) relationship with God and holiness, humility,
  obedience and poverty. They had a sense of personal integrity which was very unlike the public morality of the Roman world.</p>
<p>For example, they refused to perform the required traditional sacrifice. Actually many Romans did not have any personal belief in their national divinities, but they saw the performance of
  religious rituals as part of their public duty to the State. What concerned them was good public order. The problem with the Christians was persistent civil disobedience and a deep-rooted culture
  clash. It is hard to imagine two sets of values – the silent, unworldly (even anti-worldly) Christians and the social, public and political virtues of the Roman world – more radically
  different. The meteoric success of this innovative cult must have felt extremely threatening to traditional Romans.</p>
<p>Before these tensions could work themselves through and find accommodation with each other, the situation changed totally. In AD 410 the city of Rome fell to
  Alaric’s Visigoth army. The sacking and looting of Rome was a terrible shock to the whole Mediterranean world. There was a deep sense that something had changed forever. Historians still tend
  to treat 410 as the end of the Classical era and beginning of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>With the collapse and break-up of the Empire an odd and confusing thing happened. In a highly turbulent and unsettled Europe, broken up into small fragmentary kingdoms and dealing with the
  constant inflow of new groups of territorially aggressive cultures from the north-east, the Church and particularly the monks – the heirs to the solitary traditions of the desert –
  became one of the principal forces of social cohesion, continuity and culture. It would be fair to say that of the two competing ideologies of the late Roman period (the public vs the private; the
  social vs the solitary) the Christian model won, but only by giving up its core values – accepting the ‘world’, embracing politics, power and even militarism. Western Europe moved
  into the early modern period with a profound confusion between the values of the social and the solitary; and an unacknowledged but profound belief that people on the ‘opposite side’
  were threatening civilization itself and were therefore very frightening.</p>
<p>The situation was inherently unstable. For the last thousand years, social history has seen a continual seesaw between these two sets of values – and therefore a constant worry and
  restlessness about how to balance the social communal good against solitary interior freedom.</p>
<p>Until the fourteenth century, solitude was highly valued. The great ‘media celebrities’ of the period were the saints – and a remarkable number of them were solitary: ascetic
  monks or hermits; people going into self-imposed exile and rejecting the civilized world; women choosing not to participate in marriage, their only socially conventional lifestyle choice. The
  greatest virtue was to ‘save your own soul’ and develop an intimate relationship with the transcendent. Those with more political ambitions (usually kings and would-be kings) could buy
  themselves out by endowing monasteries and building churches – so that their souls could be prayed for by someone else.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century the Renaissance, and in the sixteenth century the Protestant Reformation, challenged this dominant paradigm in rather different ways. But the eighteenth century saw a
  seismic shift. The Enlightenment (or Age of Reason) quite consciously generated a radical shift back towards a more Roman understanding of human society.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment deliberately sought to re-establish the ethics and moral paradigm of the Classical era. This was reflected in many more ways than purely intellectual ones: an aesthetic style
  evolved which was happily called neoclassicism and affected literature (especially poetry), fashion (men started to wear plain dark clothes and spotless linen neckcloths to demonstrate how chaste
  and clean they were; women wore simpler, plainer frocks in fragile cottons and fine silks) and particularly architecture, gardening and ‘town planning’.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, which self-consciously referred to itself as ‘the Athens of the North’, built the New Town quite deliberately and knowingly to reflect this understanding of the city as a
  model of civilization, using classical architecture to represent their rational, civilized, democratic and free society.</p>
<p>Inevitably these changes also affected private morality. The citizen was to be judged by social deportment rather than inner holiness. In Northanger Abbey Jane Austen has her heroine,
  Catherine Morland, weigh the correctness of her actions after a quarrel with her closest friends against such Enlightenment standards:</p>
<p>She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted merely her own gratification . . . no, she had attended to what was due to others,
    and to her own character in their opinion.</p>
<p>(Chapter 13, my italics)</p>
<p>For all the era’s emphasis on civility, tolerance and liberty, most Enlightenment writers despised solitude, finding it both repellent and immoral. Edward Gibbon, author
  of the famous Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776–88), wrote:</p>
<p>There is perhaps no phase in the moral history of mankind of a deeper or more painful interest than this ascetic epidemic. A hideous, distorted and emaciated maniac, without
    knowledge, without patriotism, without natural affection, spending his life in a routine of useless and atrocious self-torture . . . had become the ideal of nations which had known the writings
    of Plato and Cicero and the lives of Socrates and Cato.</p>
<p>James Wilson was even blunter:</p>
<p>An ascetic monk or ‘self-secluded man’, possibly a sulky egotistical fellow, who could not accommodate himself to the customs of his fellow creatures. Such beings
    do very well to write sonnets about now that they are (as we sincerely trust) all dead and buried, but the reader may depend upon it, they were a vile pack.</p>
<p>Edinburgh New Town employed classical architecture to represent the city’s rational, civilized, democratic and free society.</p>
<p>Sad, mad and bad, in fact!</p>
<p>By the very end of the eighteenth century, however, a new mood began to cut across the refined elegance of neoclassical enlightenment. Ideas of freedom and ‘rights’ began to conflict
  with the civic- and social-minded atmosphere; the careful public performance of mannerliness felt restrictive and a sort of anti-Enlightenment developed surprisingly fast into the Romantic
  movement. Like neoclassicism, it came with both philosophical and aesthetic baggage. Some of the principle ideas included:</p>
<p>The elevation of emotion over reason and of the senses over the intellect.</p>
<p>Introspection and the legitimate engagement with the self; a sort of heightened awareness of one’s own moods and thoughts.</p>
<p>A construction of the artist as a free creative spirit.</p>
<p>An emphasis on imagination and spontaneity as a way to spiritual truth.</p>
<p>A heightened appreciation of the beauty of nature, particularly in its most sublime and awe-inspiring aspects.</p>
<p>With such a set of concepts it is not surprising that would-be artists had somehow to escape from the coils of social convention and slip back into primal innocence so that
  they could access their deepest emotions and find their own individual ‘voice’. Suddenly there was a plethora of writers praising the value of being alone. William Wordsworth
  articulated this more explicitly than most in his poem ‘The Prelude’:</p>
<p>When from our better selves we have too long</p>
<p>Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,</p>
<p>Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,</p>
<p>How gracious, how benign, is Solitude.</p>
<p>In a way, this Romantic vision could almost be seen as a return to the early Christian paradigm: the authentic inner self, or true soul, is obscured and weakened by too much
  worldliness and corrupting materialism. The person desiring perfection must flee into the desert and nurture the inner life in solitude. The difference is, of course, that the idea of God has been
  replaced by the idea of the ego as quasi-divine.</p>
<p>Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries this idea extended its reach. Originally it had been understood as a route for ‘geniuses’, for especially endowed talents, but
  gradually, as this set of ideas met with wider ideas of equality and human rights, everyone became a genius.</p>
<p>This might well have led to a renewal of the values of solitude, but in fact it had, as we know, the opposite effect. This was partly because the concept of freedom and rights had other
  important dimensions – and many of those required collective actions; among them widening the vote, the trade-union movement, the various campaigns for national freedom (Byron, the great
  Romantic hero, died in the war to liberate Greece), the struggle against slavery and the two activist phases of the women’s liberation movement. These necessarily pulled people into social
  association and demonstrated the power and effectiveness of collective engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time a general improvement in health, the enormous stresses of increasingly alienated labour and a lowering of inhibition about sex made personal relationships a more important
  source of pleasure and personal fulfilment. The theme of sexual and emotional satisfaction was picked up as a central issue in the early psychoanalytic movement, so that solitude began to seem not
  only impossibly difficult but also unhealthy.</p>
<p>Throughout the twentieth century the conflict in values continued. In one sense you could argue that the present model– which emphasizes ‘fulfilment’ as a ‘human
  right’, by widening (but thinning) one’s social environment, while seeking the individual good (rather than the communal good) within it – was a clever compromise. But because
  this model is so brittle, it is inevitably defensive and particularly punitive towards anything that tries to challenge it.</p>
<p>This almost absurdly brisk canter through some elementary history of European cultural paradigms reveals, I hope, a sort of pendulum swinging between various options for understanding the good
  life; and in all them the question of solitude – both of our psychological capacity and of our ethical obligations to be alone – has been key to the understanding of society and
  identity. As we came to the beginning of a new millennium, the pendulum was reaching an extreme outer limit of its range, in favour of relationality and social life. This has perhaps been obscured
  by the cult of individualism, which has, rather oddly, developed simultaneously.</p>
<p>This situation is increasingly fragile. The global financial crisis has raised massive questions about the sustainability of consumerist capitalism based on perpetual economic growth; the
  language of human rights appears to have delivered just about all the benefits (and they were real and substantial) that it can; people, at least in the developed world, are losing commitment to
  participatory democracy and to liberal religious faith; and the eco-scientists are showing us with increasing clarity just how tenuous the whole life-as-we-know-it project is becoming. To go back
  to Rome, the barbarians are at the gate. In these circumstances solitude is threatening – without a common and embedded religious faith to give shared meaning to the choice, being alone is a
  challenge to the security of those clinging desperately to a sinking raft. People who pull out and ‘go solo’ are exposing the danger while apparently escaping the engagement.</p>
<p>No wonder we are frightened of those who desire and aspire to be alone, if only a little more than has been acceptable in recent social forms. No wonder we want to establish solitude as
  ‘sad, mad and bad’ – consciously or unconsciously, those of us who want to do something so markedly counter-cultural are exposing, and even widening, the rift-lines.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the present paradigm is not really working. Despite the intense care and attention lavished on the individual ego; despite over a century of trying to ‘raise
  self-esteem’ in the peculiar belief that it will simultaneously enhance individuality and create good citizens; despite valiant attempts to consolidate relationships and lower inhibitions;
  despite intimidating efforts to dragoon the more independent-minded and creative to become ‘team players’; despite the promises of personal freedom made to us by neoliberalism and the
  cult of individualism and rights – despite all this, the well seems to be running dry. We are living in a society marked by unhappy children, alienated youth, politically disengaged adults,
  stultifying consumerism, escalating inequality, deeply scary wobbles in the whole economic system, soaring rates of mental ill-health and a planet so damaged that we may well end up destroying the
  whole enterprise.</p>
<p>Of course we also live in a world of great beauty, sacrificial and passionate love, tenderness, prosperity, courage and joy. But quite a lot of all that seems to happen regardless of the
  paradigm and the high thoughts of philosophy. It has always happened. It is precisely because it has always happened that we go on wrestling with these issues in the hope that it can happen more
  often and for more people.</p>
