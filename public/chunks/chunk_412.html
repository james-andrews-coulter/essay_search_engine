            <h2>How to Deal with the Meanness of the Media</h2>
<p>If we look at the media from a particular angle, we stand to notice a distinctive fact: almost every story is about failure. What we call a news story is in essence a ‘failure story’ – someone’s marriage has fallen apart, someone’s business has gone bankrupt, someone has been fired, someone is involved in a scandal, someone has gone ‘mad’.</p>
<p>There is something else. These stories of failure are not, in general, told with any particular imagination or sympathy. Instead, what stands out is the unrelieved viciousness and condemnatory tone on display. If we are to believe the media, all politicians are intrinsically awful, venal, self-interested and actively trying to bring down the nation they claim to care for. People who come to grief in business are monstrous exemplars of greed, exploitation, stupidity and narrow-mindedness. Those who have offended society’s moral codes became addicts on purpose, they were hell-bent on having affairs or they actively wanted to hurt their families. Sexual infractions – particular favourites of news organisations – are overwhelmingly the result of ‘evil’ and ‘depravity’. Indeed, most people who feature in the day’s news are simply weirdos, perverts and losers. There are never more complex motives. No one is ever profoundly sorry. No one wishes to make amends. No one ever tried hard to be good. No one was ever a child. The appetite is for moral clarity – and the news delivers reliably every time, at the expense of truth and humanity.</p>
<p>In reality, there exist almost no villains of the sort the media presents. An alcoholic is, up close, liable to be filled with repentance and guilt, most politicians would so desperately like to make things better and sexual compulsives are – in their lucid moments – usually appalled by what they have done. The news isn’t telling us the facts about people who have failed; it is giving us a window onto our emotional need to locate caricatures.</p>
<p>Long before we ever had news organisations – before there were minute-by-minute bulletins and correspondents in every city – human beings evolved a sophisticated medium for telling stories of failure with a complexity and honesty that modern news organisations never match. In the 4th century BCE, the ancient Greeks gave birth to what we know as ‘tragedy’ – the art of telling stories of failure with complexity, kindness and moral sophistication. Like news editors, the ancient tragedians picked up on the grimmest stories. They told tales of people who had lied, who had stolen money, who had had affairs, who had slept with members of their families, who had let pride and greed obstruct their judgement. But rather than labelling these figures as weirdos, perverts, reprobates and freaks, the Greeks did something far more interesting: they continued to see them as full and complex human beings, albeit ones who – like all of us – suffered from a fatal flaw in some area or another. The Greeks called this flaw a ‘hamartia’ – and it was because of a hamartia that a king might poison a rival, or a man might sleep with his mother. Crucially for the Greeks, though, a hamartia did not turn a person into a devil – to view matters like this would be too easy or naïve. The bitter truth that the Greek playwrights wished to convey is that people who end up doing bad things are fundamentally no different from you or me – they are just far less lucky. They get found out for the sorts of things that we have often done ourselves, but which to date we have been able to get away with. They give free rein to impulses that we share but which circumstances have, so far, allowed us to bottle up more securely. The central figures of Greek tragedy aren’t worse than anyone else; fate has given their flaws a terrifying window through which to become visible and active in the world.</p>
<p>Our response to hearing of failure and disaster should therefore be compassion for others and fear for ourselves – based on an awareness of how lucky we have been, until now, not to have paid the full price for our own weaknesses of character.</p>
<p>It’s a testament to the enduring skill of the great tragedians, in both ancient and more modern times, that the failed characters they have told us about have not become bywords for ignominy and evil – but are instead people whose sorrows deeply concern us and whose cruel fates we bemoan and weep over. It would never occur to us to callously call Oedipus, Antigone, Othello or Tess of the d’Urbervilles freaks or reprobates. We see them in infinitely more rounded ways. We perceive their hamartia, certainly – the strain of greed, lust, impulsiveness, naïvety or selfishness in their character that leads to their downfall – but it is placed alongside other qualities that we are never allowed to overlook. The failed hero we meet in such works of art is also capable of immense kindness, thoughtfulness, wisdom, self-sacrifice and nobility of spirit. Through these stories, we are inducted into a truth that the modern world finds far too uncomfortable to hold on to: that someone might be good and flawed, gentle and thoughtless, decent and compulsive.</p>
<p>If we were to make a list of all the great tragic heroes and their hamartias, we would find that the difference between most of us and them is not the presence of a hamartia, but that we have not yet made the fateful error that gives ours free rein. In this study, we can identify what our own hamartias are and imagine what errors and tragic consequences might develop for us – if ever fate so chose.</p>
