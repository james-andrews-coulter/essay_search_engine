        <h2>6.Water Towers</h2>
<p>Our societies are constantly sending out signals about what is potentially fascinating, impressive or beautiful to visit. They have been very good at getting us to see the charms of dolphins, mountains, little villages in rural France and art deco hotels from the 1920s. These are all very worthy objects of delight, but the list could be so much wider.</p>
<p>In 1972, a German couple – Bernd and Hilla Becher – started to photograph water towers across Germany and the United States. These industrial structures were amongst the least admired of all buildings; they were deemed hulking and brutish and people would get predictably furious if ever one was planned near where they lived.</p>
<p>Yet the Bechers’ photographs – arranged in serene and elegant frames, and hung in sequences along gallery walls – showed just how beautiful these towers actually were. One could appreciate their patterns of rust and their rugged authenticity; their legs had a distinct dignity and playfulness. They were like curious monuments in the landscape.</p>
<p>The real point of the Bechers’ exercise wasn’t specifically about water-storage facilities. The towers provided an example for a much wider point: that there is a great deal more that is lovely and interesting in the world than we have yet been encouraged to suspect.</p>
<p>The example of these photographs teaches us something else. To gain access to the full range of what is valuable, we need to suspect that the current list of what is worth seeing is radically incomplete – and we should be ready to start expanding it by ourselves, one tower at a time.</p>
