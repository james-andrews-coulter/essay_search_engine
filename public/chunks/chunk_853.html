<p>How ready would you be to agree – in your most private moments – with the following statements?</p>
<p>•   I don’t like how I look.</p>
<p>•   I have not lived up to my potential.</p>
<p>•   I am not proud of my career.</p>
<p>•   I am not as creative and successful as I should be.</p>
<p>•   I am sexually insufficient.</p>
<p>•   I have let everyone down.</p>
<p>•   No one would want me.</p>
<p>•   No one impressive could approve of me.</p>
<p>•   I am not a good person.</p>
<p>•   I should not exist.</p>
<p>The more statements we agree with from this list, the closer we are to the self-hating end of the spectrum. We should not continue to imagine that love could be easy, even if the most accomplished person were to enter our lives – indeed, especially if they were to make the error of doing so. Our underlying disgust at our own being would only create a harrowing conflict. We would recognise that another was offering us their deep affection, but in the secret folds of our souls, we could only be certain of a mistake or delusion. We would have to reject, recoil, not follow up, push away and in a thousand small and large moves ensure that a lover would eventually have to align their view of us with our view of ourselves.</p>
<p>To begin to counterbalance the hatred, we have to learn to extend compassion to ourselves for our self-lacerating impulses, and remember that how we feel about ourselves is – we can be certain – a bitter legacy of how other people, at a formative age, viewed and treated us.</p>
