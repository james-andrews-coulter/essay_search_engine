        <h3>Historic failure</h3>
<p>There is a category of failure that has a specifically historical dimension to it. This error is one that might not have been classed as such at one time, but that grows fateful because of a change in the wider political, economic or social context we inhabit. If the times hadn’t changed, we might have been safe, but, perhaps without much warning, history moves sharply and we end up on the wrong side of it. Victims of such historic failure might be aristocrats with a castle and ancestral lands before the French Revolution or industrialists with factories in the Caucasus before the Russian Revolution; they might have been those associated with the South Vietnamese government after the fall of Saigon or doctors with Western classics on their bookshelves in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>What was once a grey area can become – very suddenly – extremely black. Those with a slightly adventurous sex life find themselves in a time when moral panic is setting in, or someone who hasn’t written down all their business expenses is caught short just as the firm decides to enforce its policies more strictly. In situations like these, we know that our ‘crime’ would once have been waved through – or not registered as an infraction in the first place. For centuries, our forebears would have done exactly as we did. They might well have had servants and a castle, had threesomes, read books by intellectuals or had long lunches at the company’s expense – but what they could get away with is able – due to a riptide of history – to ruin our lives.</p>
<p>Every shift of history seems surprising when it happens. We dwell on continuities, but it would be wiser to focus instead on how often history has swerved – and dare to wonder about the areas in which we remain exposed to abrupt shifts in morality and judgement. That may, however, be too optimistic, for it’s in the nature of truly dangerous historical zigzags that no one could possibly have predicted them. Instead, perhaps we should simply be soberly aware of the degree to which the ‘common sense’ or ‘normal’ behaviour of today could be the grounds for ostracism or jail tomorrow.</p>
