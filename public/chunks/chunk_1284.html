        <h2>London Bridge</h2>
<p>Above; hundreds of cars and buses pass by every hour. Phone calls are being made and lots are being hatched. Someone is organising an $i1.7 million fundraising round for a biotech company ahead of a float in Hong Kong next March. At the nearby Old Bailey, a case is winding up involving a Canadian oil magnate and the brother-in-law of the president of Angola. Three people are independently of one another organising to go on dates at the restaurant on the top floor of the Tate Gallery. A mother employed in the commercial division of a city law firm is running across the bridge, thirty-five minutes late to pick up her 3-year-old from a nursery in Fulham.
The pressure on our lives is relentless and largely unavoidable. Yet there are opportunities for small moments of escape when we go and look at the river as it passes through the city. The buildings all around may house our practical needs and ambitions, but the flowing river cuts an alternative liquid channel through them that offers us a radically different perspective on our priorities and troubles.
The river remembers when the first exhausted, terrified groups of humans arrived at its banks, dressed in the hides of wolves, grunting obscurely. They worshipped the river as a divinity and made sacrifices to their gods inits shallows. Later, a primitive church was built nearby. A battle was fought. The Romans came and went. Corpses floated by. Severed heads bobbed up and down. Saxon children learned to swim from an embankment (now the site of the headquarters of an insurance company). One Winter in the reign of Elizabeth |, the Thames froze Over and the people held dances on the ice. A German bomber impaled itself nose first in the mud in the foggy autumn of 1943. The Particularities of today which loom so large ’” Our own frantic minds are immersed in a longer, grander story.
J 3 . . The river’s oozing, viscous clay bed Preserves memories. Down there is a phone someone threw away in a panic about their affair A wedding ring was symbolically cast away one night in despair; a gun was abandoned in remorse. A child lost Nounou over the edge. So many have looked down forlornly and hoped for rescue. Our collected tears would form a stream of their own.
The water swirls around the piers, resists a moment, then is carried down towards the marshy flatlands of the estuary. It began to collect days ago in small streams up in the hills; it swelled in size and picked up speed, passing medieval churches, pubs, villas, car showrooms, a cricket pitch, a cemetery and is now almost at its journey’s end, heralded by the impatient squawk of seagulls and the occasional reckless grey seal venturing upstream in search of sand eels. No drop of water will be in the precise same place ever again, no waveform will ever be identical. The moments of our lives are equally unique, fugitive and unobserved.
In the middle of the status-conscious, materially minded city, there is an alternative voice, whispering consoling messages to us about the vanity of all things: this too shall pass. The river offers to return us to a position in which our worldly concerns are balanced by an equal attention to what is solitary, profound and sincere. We are fated to be hybrid beings, simultaneously material and soulful; we are creatures of the city and of the river. Bridges are where our two worlds interconnect. We should not merely cross them: we need also regularly to pause and hear what they are trying to tell us.## Sindorim Station</p>
<p>We saw them for only a moment. They were heading southbound, on the line to Samseong. We’d transferred over on the Incheon line after meeting a friend in Guro, and fora moment, our eyes met on the escalator. It was a typical miniscule incident of connection, such as a large city (and especially its stations and trains) inspires every day.
Over time, our true relationship has become extremely difficult. It’s now almost impossible to avoid areas of irritability. A simple word can set them or us off. Only yesterday there was another dispute about their cousin, and before that, about the bins. It’s been so long since we were able to display the reserves of kindness and sweetness we still possess. We would like so much to be tender and innocent, as we were at the start; we aren’t anything like the dour figures we appear to have become. We crave a chance to laugh and to adore.
We noticed them immediately on their way down. They were looking into the middle distance and had a trace of a smile, as if they had just thought of an incongruous incident or remark. Something about the way they held themselves implied an_ intelligent, slightly gauche manner, as though they were signalling how absurd they found the business of living, but that they were still committed to approaching its paradoxes with thoughtfulness and good humour.
We can imagine how we might be able to trust them with the odder sides of our personalities. Instead of withdrawing when we disclosed some of our ideas, they might come up with intriguing new suggestions of their own; they’d gladly join with us in a mutual conspiracy Against the rest of the world. They would see Us without the baggage of the past: there would beno legacy of hurts, no list of resentments and no grudges.
As we approach the ticket hall, we imagine how a life with them might develop. We’d laugh together over their old professor at Seoul National University. We’d be fascinated by each other’s ideas about politics (they’d be interested in reforms to the constitution and might at one time have helped canvass votes for the Mirae Party). They might originally be from out of town, maybe Changwon or Cheongju. Perhaps their father was an engineer and their mother a dental hygienist. We’d discover unexpected, deep points of overlap in our interests and attitudes (the novels of Han Moo-sook or pansori music). Routine activities would become fun in their company; we’d tease each other while cleaning the bathroom. It would be adventure enough just to explore the supermarket aisles with them.
We won’t, of course, ever know them but the point isn’t to arrive at an accurate vision of who this particular person really is. Something larger and more important is at stake in our fantasies in the station. A new idea is starting to develop: a better relationship could be possible; there might be someone (there might even be many) around whom life could be sweeter and more exciting. The disappointments of the present do not have to be a guide to the future. There continue to be grounds for hope. The city has plenty more stories to offer us.</p>
