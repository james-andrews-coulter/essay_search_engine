        <h2>AN EMOTIONAL PRENUPTIAL CONTRACT</h2>
<p>At present, a prenuptial contract typically addresses the division of money and property should a marriage break down. Drawing one up can look rather cynical, but it is a hugely wise move. A prenuptial contract takes seriously the idea that a marriage (however well intentioned at its start) might turn out badly. So it seeks to clarify certain issues in advance, when people are calm and well-disposed – understanding that it will be much harder to resolve contentious matters in the heat of psychological conflict.</p>
<p>But the problem with existing prenuptial contracts isn’t that they are cold, heartless documents; it’s that they are too narrow in the issues they address. Ideally, there would be six emotional prenuptial clauses that any couple would sign up to before getting married. These wouldn’t be focused on the final, extreme problem of how to separate; instead, they would define how each person should ideally see the marriage – and they would aim to increase the chances of a successful long-term relationship through doses of bracing and hard-won realism.</p>
<p>Clause 1: I will give up on perfection</p>
<p>A key indicator that you are ready for marriage is when you properly accept that your partner is deeply and substantially flawed. They are lovely in some ways but also (you clearly see) the carrier of many annoying and unfortunate characteristics; these might shift over time, but they won’t all go away, and new zones of troubling oddity will emerge. In multiple ways, they will be difficult to live with. But this insight is balanced by an equally direct recognition that this is completely standard. Seen from close up, everyone is slightly nightmarish in certain aspects. Therefore, one is not miserably accepting an unusually awful partner; one is openly admitting that to be married at all means tying oneself to a problematic fellow human being. A crucial consequence is that one will surrender any lingering illusion that there must be someone better out there. We’ll be ready for marriage when we take it for granted that there is no ‘right’ person for us and won’t be tempted to leap to the conclusion that we have married the ‘wrong’ person.</p>
<p>Clause 2: I do not expect to be fully understood</p>
<p>We have inherited from Romanticism the over-optimistic notion that, in a loving relationship, all the most vulnerable, secret and intricate parts of ourselves can finally be understood and accepted. The other (we like to imagine) gazes into the depths of our souls with a magnificent combination of insight and acceptance. But, however much the other seems to understand us, there will always remain major portions of our inner life that elude and confuse them. Eventually, we’re all revealed as a mystery – in some central areas – to everyone else. Our spouse will unavoidably be unable to grasp certain important things about us. They will lack the ideal sympathy we long for – not because they are stupid or cruel, but because they are another, separate individual. We’re ready for marriage when we finally give up on the hope, described as Romantic but in reality merely reckless, of being justly and fully comprehended by another human.</p>
<p>Clause 3: I recognise that I’m crazy</p>
<p>In many situations at work or with friends, it may be easy to pass as fair-minded, reasonable, pleasant and easy-going: as a rather sane person. But this can never be the whole truth. In private, you are, evidently, somewhat crazed. You are liable to get out of control, to bear intense grudges, to fixate on things that will strike others as deeply improbable, to succumb to bouts of anxiety that seem to defy common sense. Maturity doesn’t mean eliminating all these quirks and troubling tendencies; it means admitting them graciously, regretting them deeply and humbly perceiving how they will be immensely complicated for another person to cope with. Being ready to settle down involves a degree of acute, helpfully deployed embarrassment around who one is.</p>
<p>Clause 4: I am ready to stop wanting to be loved and ready to start loving</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to be loved – and in their fashion our partner does love us. But the test of readiness for marriage isn’t how much we long to be on the receiving end of another person’s selfless kindness. It means adopting towards our partner something like a parent’s attitude to their child. The parent wants to assist, even though they won’t get much thanks. They want to comfort, even though they know they won’t be comforted in return. They will forgive, despite the fact that their sympathy won’t be duly acknowledged. They will be ready to listen more than they are listened to, and won’t store this up in a reservoir of resentment. They will actively seek out the charming and endearing sides of their child – especially when they are not obvious. With another adult we are not easily inclined to do such things. But we’re well set for marriage when we’re readier to give than to demand love.</p>
<p>Clause 5: I am ready for administration</p>
<p>Our generally Romantic culture foregrounds the role of emotions in relationships. But day to day, over a long period of time together, much of what a couple will have to do together is practical in character. They will be cooking, cleaning, budgeting, occasionally hiring an electrician; they will be making purchasing decisions and deciding what to throw away. If there are children, they will be spending significant portions of their lives ferrying them across the land. These are not in any way Romantic undertakings; there’s no glamour attached to them; love songs don’t relish the times when we’ll finally be paying insurance bills together or drawing up a roster of whose turn it is to empty the pedal bin in the bathroom. Many couples have found themselves deeply disappointed that shared life is governed by chores and administration: that more time is spent on finances and tidying up than is passed in discussion of psychological or metaphysical issues. We’re ready for marriage when we accept the dignity of the ironing board or of the trip to the supermarket: when we have in our sights a realistic idea of how central administration and domestic management are actually going to be – and when we see that this isn’t a failure of love, just the natural consequence of the success of love.</p>
<p>Clause 6: I am ready to learn and to teach</p>
<p>We too easily think that love means being accepted as we are and that any attempt to change us must signal malevolence. But it is inevitable that any partner who truly cares for us will want us to be a little different from the way we are. We should good-naturedly accept the role of learning – and teaching.</p>
<p>A couple who freely and frankly agree on these six points can be declared ready for marriage and embark on their new relationship with realistic confidence.</p>
<p>An emotional prenuptial contract</p>
<p>Ideally, the witness should be the marriage director – the person who will conduct the wedding ceremony. A copy of this document should be kept by the couple and exhibited in a place where they can both see it every day at home. It might ideally be framed.</p>
