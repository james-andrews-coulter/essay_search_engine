        <h2>4.  Introspection</h2>
<p>Improvised, unstructured idleness can return us to our sensual, sentient selves; it can revive a sense of enjoyment in our bodily, physical existence, and reawaken our receptivity to our surroundings.</p>
<p>But aside from having a physical existence and perceptions, we also have what we have come to call the psyche (which is simply the Greek word for the soul) – that complex and often turbulent realm of thoughts and emotions, sub-verbal tensions and subterranean sensations which is the very material of our selves. If we are not to lose track of who we are or what we want, we need occasionally to look into that realm and examine what we find there; to catch up on what has happened to us in the last week or month, and how we feel about it; to sense the conflicts or tensions which may have accumulated while we have been absorbed in daily activity, and try to understand where they come from, and what they mean to us. In other words, we need to give some time not only to idle rumination, but to more strenuous self-investigation and introspection – to the cultivation of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Why is it important to do so? On one level, self-knowledge is a self-evident good, one of the foundations of philosophy and the hallmarks of civilization. The capacity not only to exist, but to understand ourselves, is what makes us fully human, rather than purely animal or biological beings. The motto ‘Know thyself’ was apparently one of the Delphic maxims inscribed in the Temple of Apollo; its origins were ascribed to any number of early philosophers, and Plato has Socrates use it as one of the central injunctions in his Dialogues. For as long as we have been conscious beings, we have tried to understand who we are, how to live the good life, and where we fit into the larger scheme of things – the known world around us, and the universe which remained for much of history almost entirely unknown. And, from early on, cultures and religions developed various techniques and practices of self-examination. Socrates tried to further knowledge and self-knowledge through dynamic dialogue – asking his interlocutors questions about such matters as love, or friendship, or the nature of politics, and encouraging them to press their questioning further, until they understood the very essence and the widest implications of the subjects or problems they were examining. Buddhist meditation developed the practice of sitting still for prolonged periods of time and impartially observing what is happening within us – a technique which, in its Western versions, is once again becoming popular in contemporary cultures. Other religions have asked us to examine our souls in the light of received laws or ideas of sin and salvation.</p>
<p>But I also want to suggest that if we need to look inwards – to keep ‘in touch’ with ourselves, as our contemporary phrase has it – that is not only because self-knowledge is a virtue, but because its lack diminishes us, and makes us anxious and unhappy. It also – quite crucially – prevents us from orienting ourselves in the world, or making well-founded choices, or knowing what we believe or want. Lack of self-knowledge leaves us, internally, in the dark.</p>
<p>Mind you, if you consider it for a moment, the very need for deliberate cultivation and attainment of self-understanding can be baffling. Unless we want to study ourselves as physical or biological objects (an important, but not a reflective form of investigation), how can we not know ourselves? How can the thing that is ourselves be opaque or mysterious to the thing we are? And indeed, on one level, self-knowledge is a natural property of our minds, and an aspect of consciousness which is built into the structure of our brains – that is, self-consciousness. We are the only species endowed with this faculty; that is, the ability not only to see or know something – to spot a bird, say, or learn a new song – but to know that we see and know it. And, even as we experience various states of self – say, anger or sadness – we know that we are experiencing them. In a sense, we are observing ourselves all the time.</p>
<p>But on another level, understanding ourselves is not easy or automatic at all. We know that sometimes we are perplexed by very basic questions: what exactly are we up to in our lives, what are our actual desires and aspirations? Are we happy with what we are doing, or do we want, somehow, to change? And we have probably all had moments in which we say awkward things we didn’t mean to utter; or times when we have been overwhelmed by feelings – anger, shame, or for that matter, love – we didn’t exactly know we had; or periods during which, say, we drink too much, without exactly wanting or choosing to. Some of us may have experienced not only confusing feelings and impulses, but moments of deeper disorientation. If we rush ceaselessly through disconnected activities without checking in on our moods or motives, we can lose track of ourselves; in a sense, we lose the ability to experience our experiences. A rather high-flying friend, Peter, tells me that he went through a period – after several months of working, playing and travelling ceaselessly – when he simply didn’t remember where and who he was when he woke up. Such states are, of course, very disconcerting, and he had to take some time off work in order to regain his bearings and his sense of his normal, grounded identity.</p>
<p>It seems that in the realm of our inner life, self-knowledge is not a given of our nature, nor easily attained. The practice of self-reflection needs to be developed and nurtured – and in our age of virtual hyperactivity, this does not come to us easily or naturally. Our very notions of what it means to know ourselves – or to have an identity – are being fundamentally altered by digital technologies. In our abbreviated digital communications (whether on Twitter or on Facebook), we present and express the most transitory and superficial aspects of our personalities. We report what we are doing at a particular moment; or give sound-bite versions of an idea or opinion (‘I am driving down horrible M21 and hoping to reach Villesville soon’; ‘That was a great speech at the climate change conference’). We ‘know’ ourselves through the selfies we take of ourselves, and which give us back the visual surfaces of our activities and selves. This can undoubtedly be fun, and images can function as a memory-aid – they can remind us where we’ve been, and what we have done. But such reminders of surface impressions are not an equivalent of knowing ourselves in three dimensions; indeed, our addiction to recording our experiences moment by moment may deflect us from our immediate responses and sensations, and prevent us from experiencing the moment in its non-virtual actuality in the first place. (And, incidentally, images can lie very well. In a selfie taken in front of some Greek taverna, we may be smiling toothsomely to indicate we’re having a great time; but in fact, we may be in the middle of an upsetting conflict with our partner, and in a terrible mood.) What we are in danger of losing in our predilection for producing and conveying instantaneous information is the very idea of inwardness, and of understanding ourselves not only in the immediate moment, but through extended time. Accessing that ‘deep space’ of our internal lives requires a more sustained process of introspection.</p>
<p>How, then, can we develop the capacity – and the subtle skills – of looking inwards? How can we begin to delve into and explore the aspects of ourselves which are not easily reachable, or known? It is of course impossible to be prescriptive about this most individual and delicate of endeavours; but the first step is certainly to turn off our smartphone, and find a place which is free from external distractions, and which allows us to retreat temporarily to the privacy of our thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>Of course, this may be, to many of us, a discomfiting prospect. When we speak about ‘threats to privacy’, what we usually mean are the dangers of government or corporate access to our computerized information. But in the meantime, we are all too often willing to give away the most meaningful kind of privacy – the privacy of our personal and internal experience. In sending intimate disclosures to dozens or hundreds of ‘friends’ in our network, or ‘sharing’ images of ourselves in various states of dress or undress, we lose the habit, or the ability, to contain our experiences within ourselves and come to understand them from within. The silence of quiet rumination can seem to us to be a state of frightening emptiness and stasis.</p>
<p>But self-reflection is hardly equivalent to blankness or cessation of effort. It requires focus and a particular kind of concentration. It also requires intervals of time for the very different kind of temporality which courses within ourselves – within subjectivity. Internal time does not move in chronological progressions. A thought can arise and develop over an extended period; a glide from the present to the past can happen in a split second. Looking inwards is not a process that can be rushed, or in which we can try to be efficient.</p>
<p>One experiment in what might be called informal self-analysis has been described in two charming books by the writer and painter Marion Milner, who eventually became a psychoanalyst, and who wrote under the pseudonym Joanna Field. In A Life of One’s Own and An Experiment in Leisure, she tells us that she wants to overcome a sense of confusion in her life, and to discover what really makes her happy or gives her enjoyment. She does so by exploring ‘the no-man’s land which lay between the dark kingdom of the psychoanalyst and the cultivated domain of my conscious thought … I had not realized that by a few simple tricks of observation I could become aware of quite unexpected things in myself.’</p>
<p>One of these tricks was to keep herself ‘particularly alert to any little movements going on in the back of my mind, passing ideas which were often quite irrelevant to my task of the moment … I called these “butterflies” for they silently fluttered in from nowhere and were gone in a moment.’</p>
<p>Sometimes, as Marion Milner discovered, acknowledging such ‘passing ideas’ requires the courage of honesty – of facing up to something which may seem incompatible with our self-image, or with what we think should matter to us. In A Life of One’s Own she describes a long reverie, in which she tried to discern what was making her distressed on a particular morning; as she sits on a river bank and allows the rhythm of the flowing water to encourage her own flow of thoughts, she eventually admits to herself that what nags at the back of her mind is an earlier moment when she failed, in conversation with a man she found interesting, to hold his attention. A small admission, seemingly, but one which was difficult for her to make and which gave her great relief once it was made. She could go on to savour the beauty of her surroundings, and enjoy the morning fully without being distracted by an obscure internal discomfort.</p>
<p>Marion Milner went on to study psychoanalysis. But whether we are aware of psychoanalytic theory or not, in our contemporary cultures, it is psychoanalysis, with its many associated therapies, which provides the main model for understanding ourselves in depth, and for the practice of introspection. Psychoanalysis is the discipline that in the last century and a half has given us the most systematic and probing observations of internal life, and the most comprehensive model of the self and its development. Indeed, psychoanalytic theory can be seen as a modern updating of the long philosophic lineage – a philosophy which adds to the older templates of human nature the element of deep subjectivity. Within the psychoanalytic conception of the self, the ‘irrational’ aspects of our make-up – violent emotions, instincts, inchoate impulses, the unconscious – are seen not as something to be vanquished by the light of rationality, but as basic materials of human identity which have to be taken into account in our understanding of ourselves, and which are a source of significant knowledge and self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Such assumptions have come to constitute for us, to quote W. H. Auden on Freud, ‘the climate of opinion’. Psychoanalysis has given us the terms through which to understand ourselves, and sometimes the lenses through which to view the world. (The Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci once said, ‘I have a third lens in my camera; it’s not Kodak or Zeiss – it’s Freud.’) As we embark on the project of self-examination, it might be useful to keep some of the insights and techniques of depth-therapies in mind – although we certainly don’t need to be theoretical about ourselves, or to think through a theoretical vocabulary. We might, initially, give ourselves over to the state which Milner discovered for herself, and which therapists call reverie or free association: a kind of non-judgemental attention in which we allow images, memories or indiscriminate associations to float to the surface of our minds, and stop ourselves from fending them off, no matter how insignificant they may seem. We need, in a way, to be open to ourselves and to what we discover within – and to discover it in our own words and ways.</p>
<p>What we find there will undoubtedly be very specific, and perhaps surprising even to ourselves. When I was studying psychoanalysis, I was struck by the great variety and singularity of people’s inner lives. I remember, for example, a woman who could not fall asleep when the street outside was quiet, because the noises of life reassured her that she would not disappear while she slept; that there was something to come back to. There was a young man who worried perennially that he was not thankful enough to people he met; or that he was too stickily thankful. The patterns of psychic life are difficult to generalize; and perhaps the first step in self-examination is to acknowledge those small ways of acting or reacting which are a part of our particular personalities; to notice, for example, when we are pretending to enjoy ourselves at a party without actually doing so, or when we are bothered by a seemingly insignificant exchange with a colleague (did her lip curl in slight scorn, even as she was forcing herself to be respectful about a proposal we made?) and to be honest about why that is.</p>
<p>It is the distinguishing hallmark of psychoanalysis that – unlike other theories of self – it takes such individual traits and quirks seriously. In contrast to traditional philosophies which have seen human nature in the light of general precepts, psychoanalysis started with close observation of particular people, and the often unpredictable patterns and details of their interior lives – and within its picture of the self, such details matter. Our emotions, thoughts, inner conflicts and passions are the essence of what makes us human – and our particular passions and stories are what make us the specific individuals we are.</p>
<p>This is also in interesting contrast to Buddhist meditation, which, in its more extended forms (as opposed to the meditation-lite offered in Mindfulness programmes) provides another model for self-reflection, and one which has often been compared to psychoanalysis. There are indeed affinities between the two practices; but the crucial difference, it seems to me, is in their attitudes to the character of the individual personality and self. Buddhist meditation proceeds from the premise that the world as we know it – the world of appearances – is ultimately meaningless and veils a more permanent reality; and that the individual self (which, after all, will be reincarnated as something else after death) is essentially insignificant. Nor are the contents of our inner lives – thoughts, feelings, fantasies – of much importance. In meditational sessions, people are instructed to remember that ‘thoughts are only thoughts; fantasies are only fantasies’ – and to let them go as if they were cloudy vapour. The aim (at least as it is conveyed in Western versions of meditational philosophy) is to clear our minds of both, and to sense the ephemeral nature of our concerns – a state which allows for truer and clearer perception of reality. Why worry about that colleague’s curled lip, if we are an ephemeral speck within a transient and ultimately illusory reality?</p>
<p>There have been eloquent testimonies to the power of meditation, although these usually come from adherents who have retreated for prolonged periods to ashrams or monasteries, or other places devoted exclusively to meditative practices – who have, in other words, made it a way of life. But others have found that while meditation helps them in sloughing off temporary tensions, it does not address or resolve the actual conflicts or stresses which accumulate so easily in our societies – however small they may seem in the larger scheme of things.</p>
<p>Of course worrying about someone’s ambiguous gesture of disapproval can be overdone. But if such things nag at us, if an errant expression surfaces with a disturbing clarity before we go to sleep, that may be because for us it may have significance, and hold clues to some deeper, or more important concerns – say, an excessive fear of rejection, or a sense of one’s own inadequacy. Within the psychoanalytic conception of the self, such oddities of feeling and quirks of personality are seen as important; and the aim is not to dispel them by declaring their insignificance, but to address them and understand them in all their dimensions. In formal depth-therapy, a small symptom (repeatedly forgetting the keys to one’s apartment, say) or an odd reaction which has assumed a disproportionate importance in the account of a person’s week (the patient was annoyed rather than sympathetic to a friend who was ill) is pursued through associations, or interpretation, to what may be their deeper or un-acknowledged sources in the patient’s psychic life – so that eventually, the underlying causes of surface difficulties can hopefully be grasped and resolved.</p>
<p>At the same time, psychoanalysis offers powerful suggestions as to why self-knowledge is so difficult to attain. This is not because we are insufficiently clever or incapable of rigorous ratiocinative thought about the world; or because we live in a perceptual cave, where true reality is veiled from our eyes. Rather, it is because we ourselves are hidden from ourselves; because some of the forces which drive us and impel our sensations and feelings are not fully known to us. They are, in fact, unconscious.</p>
<p>In Freud’s first formulations, parts of our internal life become inaccessible to us because of the mechanisms of repression – because certain feelings or impulses (in his hypothesis, these were mostly sexual) are so intolerable in some circumstances that they have to be ‘forgotten’, or hidden out of consciousness. Freud’s first patients suffered from such florid symptoms as paralysis without any physiological cause, or the inability to speak in one’s native language, or coughing unstoppably when certain subjects or memories were touched on. The work of psychoanalysis was to help patients bring the repressed feelings masked by such symptoms to the surface – to become conscious of them; and this was often a very painful process.</p>
<p>The lack of self-knowledge, on this level, can lead to illness and emotional paralysis; and sometimes to wasted lives. The effort of self-knowledge is not only ennobling, but necessary to our happiness and health. In our time, as many contemporary psychoanalysts have noted, the failure to understand what is going on within ourselves is likely to come not from repression, but from the scattering and fragmentation of our internal lives – the inability to figure out the connections between our disparate activities, or even to remember them, or to give them personal meaning. This of course mirrors the fragmentation of our external lives, and is greatly exacerbated by digital technologies and the scattering of attention – of mind and feeling – they encourage.</p>
<p>Freud’s couch – an icon of psychoanalysis, and of deep self-investigation.</p>
<p>None of this is an argument for studying psychoanalysis or entering formal psychotherapy; but it makes the need for periods of self-examination more urgent. If we want to avoid states of stress or disorientation so easily induced by our lifestyles, we need to gather the fragments of our experience together, and to make sense of their meanings to us – perhaps before passing problems or worries become more deeply and perplexingly embedded in our emotional lives, and turn into more distressing states of inner disorientation or mysterious anxiety. What do we feel – and think – about what has happened to us during the previous week or month? Why does a particular incident we didn’t have time to think about continue to worry us? What does it touch off in ourselves that gives it importance out of its actual proportion? In order to track down the significance of such details to their sources in ourselves, we may need to move from states of reverie to a more strenuous exploration of our inner lives.</p>
<p>Insight can catch us unawares in almost any situation – as we are taking a bath, or boarding a bus – and such small epiphanies can constitute clues to our particular predispositions and personalities. But aside from passing perceptions or sensations, our inner lives are also affected by pressures or conflicts which are more deeply and more stubbornly embedded in the structure of our subjectivity. In order to understand those, we need not only to be receptive to the errant impressions or associations which surface from our minds, but to think about them in a more focused and concentrated way. By ‘thinking’ here, I do not mean the activity of abstract reasoning; but rather, a process that absorbs the whole self, and that takes into account those elusive entities called emotions as well as impersonal or broader ideas. Contemporary psychoanalysts refer to ‘the space to think’ – a non-chartable terrain which includes all of our affective and ratiocinative capacities – and it is that elusive but crucial territory that we need both to open up and to traverse if we want to become conscious of what is going on within us. We need to think inwards, and to think from within.</p>
<p>What we discover through such explorations may be, initially, quite disconcerting. The deep space of subjectivity can be a turbulent realm, full of feelings we would rather not have – anger, shame, guilt, envy, vulnerability, dread of death – and that we are loath to acknowledge. But such acknowledgement can bring great relief: the relief of clarity. If we understand our proclivities to anger, say, we may not succumb so easily to irrational fits of fury, ostensibly provoked by small daily conflicts (or because someone snatched our taxi or parking space) but actually fuelled by, say, feeling inadequately appreciated or loved; we may not be overtaken by an onset of sudden anxiety on the way from a meeting, which actually masks a sense of sadness and loss of safety caused by a close person’s death. We may be less in the dark.</p>
<p>Here is Marion Milner again, as she progressed further in her experiment in self-knowledge: ‘And it was gradually, by exploring this region,’ she writes, referring to something like subjective space, ‘that I came to understand what forces were distorting and limiting my powers of perception, preventing me from making constant use of that source of happiness which my earlier observations had brought to light.’</p>
<p>Emma, who has made a habit of making ‘the space to think’ in her life in order to counter the sense of being perpetually scattered, has found that systematic introspection can make her better acquainted with the distorting forces in herself, and lead her to salutary insight. ‘After a while, I can see what’s being played out,’ she says. ‘Or what I’m playing out.’ For example, after examining some very odd reactions to her friends and colleagues, she began to realize how envious she was of many of her professional and even personal contacts. Emma is a highly ethical person; and she doesn’t believe that professional success, or high salaries, or a friend’s attractiveness, are important enough to warrant envy. And yet, she had to admit that envy was what she felt, and that it was a troubling sensation – partly because it was so dissonant with her self-image and values. It was only after she confronted this sensation head-on and circled around its causes (her own dissatisfaction with herself; her father’s early preference for her younger sibling) that this complex feeling began to lift. Although the process of arriving at this realization was difficult, there was great pleasure for her in reaching new and deeper understanding – as well as in gaining control over troubling emotions. Understanding is its own reward; when Emma reached it, she found she went to work in a happier mood, and stopped being unnecessarily suspicious of her occasionally more successful colleagues. As an incidental bonus, this made her a nicer and more effective colleague herself, and led to a small promotion. Inner conflict can hamper us greatly, and its resolutions can open up unexpected vistas.</p>
<p>Indeed, arriving at new levels of understanding is, I think, one of the great underestimated pleasures of our mental life. Remaining at the surface of our experience can make us feel scattered and trivial; delving down and becoming conscious of what is within can give us a sense of clarity and internal enlargement – an almost literal deepening of perception. It also means we are less at the mercy of obscure emotions, and can draw on our inner energies more directly.</p>
<p>Freud’s formulation for this kind of self-discovery was, ‘Where id was, there shall ego be.’ A more contemporary formulation of a similar idea comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the life sciences, especially neuroscience – the field in which the nature of consciousness and emotions is investigated not only speculatively, but through microscopic probes into the body and brain. On one level, students of evolutionary biology have identified several ‘universal emotions’ – fear, anger, sadness, happiness, disgust and surprise – which are the body’s instinctive reactions to the realities we encounter in our environment (danger stimulates fear, rotten meat disgust, etc.). But cutting-edge research in neuroscience suggests that the more subtle and specific feelings we experience are created by a feedback loop between body and brain; that is, between our physiological reactions and that still mysterious entity called consciousness. Here is Antonio Damasio, a leading neuroscientist with a distinctly philosophical bent, on the processes which go into the making of emotion:</p>
<p>Body and brain are engaged in a continuous interactive dance. Thoughts implemented in the brain can induce emotional states that are implemented in the body, while the body can change the brain’s landscape and thus the substrate for thoughts. The brain states, which correspond to certain mental states, cause particular body states to occur; body states are then mapped in the brain and incorporated into the ongoing mental states. A small alteration on the brain side of the system can have major consequences for the body state (think of the release of any hormone); likewise, a small change on the body side (think of a broken tooth filling) can have a major effect on the mind once the change is mapped and perceived as acute pain.</p>
<p>This is important, in part because it confirms with empirical precision what our experience so often tells us: that our minds are not disconnected from our moods, and that what we think is an intrinsic part of how we feel – and vice versa. Emotions are not only physiological currents of bad or good sensation that rise up within our bodies; they have meanings, and they proceed from the meanings we give to our experience. Indeed, the ability – and the need – to endow our experiences with significance is what makes us deeply human. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl, an existential psychoanalyst who was also a concentration camp survivor, suggests that even great suffering can be borne if we understand its meanings. On the other hand, even small doses of stress or unhappiness can drive us to antidepressants if we move through such states in a fog of disorientation.</p>
<p>In a way, the two leading modern theories of self – psychoanalysis and neuroscience – have gone some way to heal the split (which has never existed in our experience, but was inscribed into our ‘rationalist’ traditions of belief and thought) between irrational impulse and the ‘higher faculties’ of rational thought, or between body and mind. Both contemporary models of consciousness tell us that meaningful self-knowledge is knowledge that proceeds from our whole selves, and takes the whole self into account. In order to understand we need not only to think, but to think feelingly.</p>
<p>Introspective Memory</p>
<p>It is important to make sense of our experience in the present; but if we are not to risk another kind of fragmentation, we need to traverse ‘the space to think’ not only through its emotional strata but through layers of time. In our hyperactive lives, and particularly in our transactions with digital technologies, our experiences are all too often curtailed to the abbreviated moment – the minute it takes to send an SMS, or the few seconds to read a message on Twitter. By now, we have enough evidence to know that such habitual focus on the instantaneous moment diminishes cognitive memory – the capacity for recall of facts, events and people. But perhaps just as significantly, in the contraction of perception to the immediate moment, we risk losing not only the dimension of depth but of continuity – an understanding of the links between our personal past and present, of where we’ve been, what has formed us, how we have changed through time and where we may want to go.</p>
<p>Both kinds of memory are crucial to our sense of self. We are the only sentient creatures who have autobiographical memory – that is, we not only remember where we were, for example, a year ago on vacation (some animals can return to the same places on their migrations), but also the experience of ourselves being there and knowing we were the same person. Without such memory – and without a sense of continuity between our personal past and present – we would literally lose a sense of self.</p>
<p>On the neurological level, this is illustrated in dramatic and poignant cases of people who suffer from massive loss of memory, through Alzheimer’s, for example, or brain injury. In one of his studies, ‘The Lost Mariner’, the neuro-psychiatrist Oliver Sacks describes the case of Jimmie, who suffered from a brain injury which eliminated his ability to remember anything after his accident. Jimmy literally did not remember who he was – or who his doctor was – from one moment to another. If he left the room and returned immediately, he did not remember having been there a minute before, or recognize himself as the same person. This, of course, is a very extreme example, but it highlights the deep connections between memory and identity, and the importance of following what Richard Wollheim, in a wonderfully interesting book by that title, called ‘the thread of life’.</p>
<p>That thread leads us not only through the external facts of our past (when we graduated, got married, divorced), but through the internalized history we carry within ourselves. In this more elusive realm, memory does not follow straight lines or chronological laws, and in order to make sense of it, we need sometimes to allow ourselves to meander through it; to let an image from the far past surface from within our minds, or to follow an unexpected leap between an event that happened, say, in our adolescence, and one closer to the present – and to muse on the meanings of such connections.</p>
<p>Travelling over our subjective history can also help us understand ourselves in context: to think about the background that formed us, the personalities of the people who have been important to us, the influence of our education, or how our tastes, ideas and predilections may have changed. Psychoanalysts as well as philosophers sometimes talk of ‘the narrative self’ – the identity we construct through putting together both our external and our internalized stories; and we need from time to time to update ourselves on that narrative – to catch up with ourselves.</p>
<p>The ‘deep narrative’ we discover within ourselves can alter considerably as our perspective, or our views, or indeed the configuration of our internal lives change. Emma, for example, revised some of her early memories of her sister, once she understood her own envious feelings towards her, and she became less suspicious towards her younger sibling – and indeed, towards others in her environment. She wasn’t remembering different things, but she was remembering – and interpreting – them differently; and this gave her the sense that she had developed and grown, that her understanding of the world and of herself had deepened.</p>
<p>Understanding ourselves over time, rather than moment by moment, can help us gain a sense of inner coherence and continuity – and such continuity counts for a lot in our discontinuous lives. Memory helps ground us within ourselves, and to experience both the past and the present more intensely and richly.</p>
<p>A diary can give you back a candid record of your outer and inner past.</p>
<p>Keeping a Diary</p>
<p>Keeping a diary belongs to a category somewhere between leisurely reflection and active mental effort. There are of course two kinds of diary. One is used to keep a simple record of the owner’s appointments and activities, dinner parties and doctor’s appointments. This has its uses, if only to remind us that we have been present in the past, and have done things we might otherwise have forgotten entirely. It helps us follow a sequence of events in our lives, and gives to the past a concrete reality which can be both surprising and reassuring.</p>
<p>But it is the other kind of diary, in which we listen to our thoughts and jot them down as they come, that is valuable as a form of deeply private reflection, and an aid to understanding the deep and long narrative of our experience. That kind of journal probably belongs most comfortably to the era of handwriting, and pleasing pen and paper. The movements of the hand as it writes apparently follow and reflect the movements of our minds, while writing on the computer too incessantly can give us carpal tunnel syndrome. But while there is added tactile pleasure in a nicely bound notebook and a precise pen, it is nevertheless possible to keep a diary on a computer as well, if we can create a space for the kind of privacy it requires (and if we can resist looking at those emails while we do it). Spontaneity and uncensored observation and self-observation are of course the key to diary-writing, and part of its enjoyment.</p>
<p>We don’t need to spend a lot of time on keeping a journal – fifteen minutes, say, over a coffee after work is enough if we do it consistently – but developing the diary habit is especially valuable in the age of the crowd-sourced, crowd-publicized self. A private journal gives us a very different kind of self-portrait than any number of selfies or Facebook postings.</p>
<p>Marion Milner found keeping a diary extremely fruitful as she embarked on her project of self-examination. It helped her pin down her errant and sometimes vague thoughts, and make them real. It helped her to know what she actually felt and thought. Anne Frank, in her time of terrible trial, thought of her diary as her ‘friend’, and she wrote in it as if to a close intimate. Anne was an adolescent in the period when she and her family were confined and hiding in her Amsterdam attic, and the diary helped her discover new aspects of herself (including an unembarrassed eroticism, and a wicked talent for observing the foibles of others).</p>
<p>But for all of us, a diary can be a way of discovering as well as expressing our individual temperament, and it can give us a very particular and sometimes surprising portrait of our own personality and sensibility. ‘Is this what I’m like?’ we sometimes feel, as we re-read a sentence and an unexpected insight or observation comes upon us. This echoes Freud’s foundational insight about the importance of articulating our experience in words – in the case of his patients, to excavate concealed memories, or to interpret disturbing sensations. But for all of us, articulation heightens clarity, and sharpens both our feelings and our perceptions. A diary is a way of conducting a most confidential and candid conversation with ourselves; and the very act of recording such conversation can give our inchoate feelings and musings a reassuring and more vivid reality.</p>
<p>And if we keep a diary over a long period of time, it can give us back our true personal history. We can look back at our journals and see not only what has happened in our lives, but the changes and the continuities within us: in our emotional pitch towards the world, our feelings towards specific people, and not least, our ideas or broader attitudes. Like other forms of reflection, this can also make us more cognizant of who we are, and anchor us more firmly in our experience.</p>
