        <h3>1 Secularisation</h3>
<p>Perhaps the single greatest marker of modernity has been a loss of faith — the loss of a belief in the intervention of divine forces in earthly affairs. All other ages before our own held that our lives were at least half in the hands of gods or spirits, who could be influenced through prayer and sacrifice and who required complex forms of worship and obedience. But we have increasingly put our energies into understanding natural events through reason: there are no more omens or revelations, curses or prophecies; our futures will be worked out in laboratories, not temples. Even the nominally religious will demur to highly trained physicists and cancer specialists. God has died and modernity has killed Him.</p>
