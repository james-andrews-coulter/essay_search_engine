        <h4>YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK</h4>
<p>One of the duties of parenthood is having to induct our beloved child into the reality – and horrors – of existence. Starting with homework.</p>
<p>It’s been a difficult evening. Your 10-year-old was screaming that she wasn’t going to do maths and your gentle encouragement didn’t do any good. She kept asking ‘why do I have to do it?’ Now, as you say good night, you try to give her a proper answer.</p>
<p>→I know you’d rather not do it, and it’s true that as an adult you’ll probably never need to work out 6,397 divided by 82. You’ll just use your phone (or whatever technology has replaced it). But sadly you’re not being asked to do this because it’s useful. You’re being asked in order to introduce you to the idea that life is filled with things you have to do not because you want to but because you have to.</p>
<p>Your child has drifted off to sleep but you keep talking, very quietly.</p>
<p>→The truth is, it will be like this again and again. You’ll have to do so much you don’t see the point of to get through this painful life. One day, many years from now, it will be 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon and it’ll be lovely outside but you’ll have to be analysing trends in electricity pricing in Belgium or chasing up a client who is deciding whether to invest in a multi-storey car park in Croydon. It won’t interest you in the least, but you’ll have to do it, because you’ll have bills to pay and a career to uphold. You think homework will end when you finish school, but here’s the truth: having to do things you don’t want to do goes on throughout your life. It is – in many ways – what life is.</p>
<p>When you are in a relationship, you’ll need to do things your partner wants, even though they have no appeal for you. You’ll have to visit their family; think of interesting things to say to their father about a film you didn’t enjoy; make breezy conversation with their aunt who rather frightens you, or their brother, who you find entirely dull.</p>
<p>The agony will go on across a range of areas. Certain people will judge you in ways that are manifestly unfair, and you won’t be able to do anything about it. Enemies will hate you for no reason. If you complain, you will be called thin-skinned.</p>
<p>You’ll keep on thinking for a while that you can escape. Perhaps after university, or after you make some money, or once you’re married, or after you get divorced, or once the children have left home. You’ll dream of a place and time without anxiety, suffering and feelings of loss and alarm.</p>
<p>But you will never get there. All the while, you’ll need to keep making enormous efforts and the fun times will get ever fewer and far between. You’ll have to watch what you eat, even when you’re longing to have another piece of carrot cake. You’ll find that the most delicious things are fattening, and that at points in your life, you’ll crave food as the only pleasure that you’re allowed.</p>
<p>In your leisure time, you’ll have to make yourself do stretching exercises because your limbs will start to stiffen. One day, you’ll notice how much you have aged. The bad photo of you from ten years back will exceed this year’s most flattering shot.</p>
<p>There’ll come a time when you’ll have to force yourself to make an appointment to see the radiologist; you’ll have to accept the dreadful verdict though it will obviously be idiotic that your life, your dazzling inner existence, your sheer loveliness and beauty and your delight in seeing the sky and the trees will all come to an end in this senseless, strange, amazing and exhilarating world.</p>
<p>Your life will in certain ways be a long sequence of different kinds of homework. Horribly, maths is the easiest version: a beginners’ guide and almost a pleasure.</p>
<p>Poor darling. I love you more than I can say.</p>
<p>You turn the light down, move softly out of the room and head back to the kitchen, where your partner is wondering why you’ve been taking so long and keeping your child up too late when there’s school in the morning – and where your laptop and the spreadsheets are waiting for you, open on the table.</p>
