        <h3>5 Beyond the ego: mind and body</h3>
<p>The human animal is a proud creature. We puff ourselves up, we exaggerate our competence and integrity. We imagine ourselves making a difference. At the heart of our misplaced assurance is a particular concept of the self. We imagine the self as an integrated ego that can understand most of what it is, that is radically separate from the world beyond — and that may have an immaterial essence that will endure after the body has expired.</p>
<p>Science flatly contradicts us on all such assumptions. The ego emerges from its analyses as something far closer to what Buddhism has long suggested: an artful illusion, a flickering, unsteady flame unaware of most of what it is, an entity thoroughly merged with and traversed by the world beyond it, an ‘I’ destined to dissolve after a brief span and to be reabsorbed by a cosmic totality from which it should never have imagined itself to be distinct. To listen to the neuroscientists, our impression of being a coherent ‘I’ is only a clever trick performed by a narrative capacity lodged somewhere within the cerebral cortex, and that weaves our scattered memories and intermittent sensations together into an ongoing sense of being someone in particular rather than just a rough assemblance of random impressions, pain and pleasure signals and conflicting wishes.</p>
<p>Our conscious awareness comprises only a fraction, as little as five per cent, of our overall cognitive activity. Most of what we do in our brains is housed in faculties from which our day-to-day understanding has been barred — we both somewhere know and yet actively don’t know how to make our hearts beat, grow fingernails, digest sugar, walk up the stairs and extract oxygen from the air. We don’t have the keys to our own house.</p>
<p>Rather than one unitary brain, we are an assemblage of different brains that evolved in separate millennia, each with its own sets of priorities and agendas kept private from our pilot selves: the cerebellum wants one thing, the hippocampus another, the medulla a third. The sense of being ‘a person’ is a simplification designed to keep us steady, and whose invented nature we sometimes get a sense of as we fall asleep or when we are discombobulated by illness or start to be fragmented by age.</p>
<p>As evidence of how much otherness we bear within us, we need only consider that our gut is host to more than 10,000 alien microbial species, single-celled eukaryotes as well as helminth parasites and viruses, that entered our bodies in the early years of life (as we licked the carpet or kissed our parents) and that now help us to digest dietary fibre or synthesise vitamins B and K. We tend to keep quiet, as we introduce ourselves to someone else with the use of a single name, about the symbiotic relationship we are currently conducting with trillions of wholly foreign bacterial cells pullulating within us a few millimetres from our waistband.</p>
<p>As for our sense of being continuous, this too has little basis in our biology. We may think of ourselves as a unitary person who survives through time, but pieces of us are constantly dying and being remade. Thirty thousand cells are lost every minute; the average cell is seven years old. Our external surface layer is replaced once a year; every decade, our whole skeleton is remade; every two years, our liver is fashioned anew. We’re not so much a person as an instruction manual for a person who keeps dissolving and having to be laboriously reassembled.</p>
<p>At our deaths, the fictional nature of our egos can no longer be denied, and our sixty trillion cells become a feast for maggots, bacteria and fungi. A part of us will end up in the stomach of a beetle. A slug will feast on a part of our liver. A bit of us will provide nutrients for a hawk. The carbon in our bones will end up inside the trunk of a conifer tree. Some of us will come down as rain. We were never really an ‘I’; we just borrowed some bits of the universe for a few moments and will go on to be many other things, just as valuable, in time. Like every living thing, we were made from tiny shards of stars; we have travelled through supernovas. We’re as old as the universe; ‘I’ was just a passing phase. What was lent to us by the Earth will animate new life in time. None of this should panic us. Scientific reality may inspire a far more consoling philosophy than any book of prayer. We don’t need to clasp so tightly onto life. We are never quite whole and will soon enough be in pieces again.</p>
<p>There is no use expecting to be remembered by the name our parents thoughtfully gave to a small assemblage of cells — all now long dead — many years ago. The woodlice and the pigeons will be grateful. We are not strangers to death: atom by atom, we’ve been falling apart and being remade for over thirteen billion years.</p>
