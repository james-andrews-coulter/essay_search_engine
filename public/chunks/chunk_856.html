        <h2>Knowing What to Overlook</h2>
<p>Many people, after they’ve been in a couple for some time, will privately admit that they are – in many ways – frustrated and disappointed by the person they’ve chosen to share their lives with.</p>
<p>If pressed for details, they will have no difficulty coming up with a list. Their partner, they might complain:</p>
<p>•   is too loyal to their irritating family</p>
<p>•   doesn’t share their views on the layout of the living room</p>
<p>•   never wants to go on camping holidays</p>
<p>•   plays tennis every Wednesday evening, no matter what</p>
<p>•   doesn’t like Moroccan food</p>
<p>•   doesn’t share their enthusiasm for 19th-century Russian novels</p>
<p>•   has a friend who laughs for no apparent reason</p>
<p>•   likes doing jigsaws</p>
<p>•   drinks coffee from a big mug with ‘1984’ inscribed on the side</p>
<p>•   has a habit of adding ‘actually’ to every second sentence, when it’s actually redundant</p>
<p>As the list gets longer, they sigh; they still love their partner and long to be happy together, it’s just that it seems impossibly complicated to make this relationship work.</p>
<p>What’s driving the frustration isn’t that they have sadly fallen for an idiot as a mate; it’s rather that we have all inherited needlessly complicated ideas of what relationships might be for. We are told that love is meant to involve the almost total merging of two lives: we expect that a loving couple must live in the same house, eat the same meals together every night, share the same bed, go to sleep and get up at the same time, only ever have sex with (or even sexual thoughts about) each other, regularly see each other’s families, have all their friends in common – and pretty much think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful vision, but a hellish one too, for it places an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another human. We feel the partner must be right for us in every way, and if they’re not, that they must be prodded and cajoled into reforming.</p>
<p>But there’s another perspective from which to evaluate our needs: relationships don’t have to be so complicated and ambitious if we keep in view what in the end actually makes them fulfilling. If we boil matters down, there are – as we have seen – only five essential things we want from one another:</p>
<p>i.     A mutual, nondefensive readiness to admit to imperfections.</p>
<p>ii.    A willingness to let ourselves be vulnerable.</p>
<p>iii.  A generous, compassionate response to our flaws and errors.</p>
<p>iv.   A therapeutic reaction to what is ‘mad’ inside both of us.</p>
<p>v.    A sufficient lack of anger to keep admiration alive.</p>
<p>When these big, underlying themes are in place, it’s not that the other irritants or points of difference will magically disappear. They’ll still be there, but our perspective on them will alter.</p>
<p>Everyone is, at some level, a wounded animal, a broken creature. The encounter between two such beings can only ever be fractious at points. A degree of pessimism underwrites hope. We’ll never find someone who agrees with us at all moments, but we may discover a partner who can see – and soothe – our existential loneliness, be tender towards our sadness and sympathetic to our less edifying aspects. We can accommodate almost any number of divergences in taste, background and intellect if the central emotional attitudes are secure.</p>
<p>By limiting what we expect a relationship to be about, we overcome the tyranny and bad temper that bedevils too many initially hopeful unions. A bond between two people can be deep and important precisely because it is not accompanied by boundless expectation, nor played out across all practical details of existence. By simplifying – and clarifying – what a relationship is for, we release ourselves from overly complicated fantasies – and can focus instead on our urgent underlying need for sympathy, generosity, tenderness, honesty and warmth.</p>
