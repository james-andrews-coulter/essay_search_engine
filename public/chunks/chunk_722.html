        <h2>BASIC TRUST</h2>
<p>The greatest psychological achievement we might try and aim for in relation to anxiety is what has been termed ‘Basic Trust’.</p>
<p>Basic Trust means that even though we can never know for certain what will happen, though we have no absolute guarantees as to how things will turn out, though we cannot wholly control our destinies and though there are some very uncomfortable dangers lurking in certain places, we maintain a belief that things are going to be – more or less – OK. They might not be so every day – there will be rocky moments ... sadness or despair – but, broadly speaking, we have a gut sense that we’ll pull through.</p>
<p>Importantly, this cannot ever be a firm knowledge; it is – in the true sense – a faith, a resilient belief in our survival and endurance outside of definitive evidence.</p>
<p>This Basic Trust might not sound like much but it is, in fact, the secret to a bearable existence.</p>
<p>This faith is, for most of us, a gift rather than any form of personal achievement, a gift bestowed on us by a childhood spent in the company of someone who felt (long before we were capable of it) Basic Trust in turn. When a drink was spilt, they didn’t panic; they fetched a cloth and mopped it up. When there was a knock at the door at an unexpected moment, they didn’t jump in surprise. When there was a reversal at work, they took it in their stride. When we felt angry and confused, they saw the bigger picture, interpreted us with benevolence and took us in their arms. And from these examples, we derived a sense that we dwelt among people on whom we could depend.</p>
<p>But many of us did not receive such a childhood. That is (probably) why we are here.</p>
<p>Yet importantly, the wisdom we didn’t see acted out as toddlers can, with a little luck, be picked up in adulthood. Through a lot of thought, patience and introspection, we may come to a point where we too build up a bit of faith in the solidity of our circumstances, where we can take a few risks with people and with ourselves, where we don’t need to be terrified of every new encounter or every new day – and where we can accept that even though we can’t anticipate the whole future, we will be able to cope with whatever it happens to deliver.</p>
