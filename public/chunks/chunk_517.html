        <h2>The Distraction of the News</h2>
<p>News got started as an urgent bulletin of facts delivered to people with a desperate need to know things: the wildebeest are at the waterhole; if you eat this kind of berry you will die; enemy troops are marshalling on the western frontier; the king’s younger brother is plotting a coup. News was vital and difficult to obtain; it was the direct spur to action and a guide to wise decision-making. You needed the news to live well.</p>
<p>But the modern, democratic concept of news quietly forgets this. Every day, it sends out a massively expanded dossier to us – so we are informed about pretty much everything that has happened anywhere in the world in the preceding hours: a murder in a town far from where we live; an update on how the mining sector is faring in Australia; the discovery of a severed head in Tokyo; developments in a bank in France; the weather in Siberia... even though there’s absolutely nothing we can or should be doing with any of this knowledge. It’s merely cluttering our minds and distracting us from our true priorities.</p>
<p>We’ve inculcated the idea that it’s necessary and deeply prestigious to constantly follow what’s happening in the world and we’ve collectively provided ourselves with endless opportunities to do so. It’s the ideal distraction: scanning the news still feels urgent and important, even though it has generally ceased to guide our actions and has in fact become the greatest source of mindless procrastination.</p>
<p>We should – when we can – dare to switch off the news and focus on a far more urgent priority: the course of our own lives.</p>
