            <h1>4. Dissolution; or, Adversity in Dying</h1>
<p>When I was about seventeen years old, my father, whose marriage to my mother had ended in divorce when I was nine, and who lived apart from us in the west of England, started
  to suffer from various pains in his stomach. He had always eaten rather badly, and his doctor put him on a healthier, high-fibre diet, believing that his problems were temporary. He achieved some
  brief respite, but the problems continued to get worse. With my younger brother, I visited my father for New Year’s Eve, at which point he had been ill for some months. That evening, we sat
  with him in the living room of his flat, overlooking the river. He told us that he was going to die. ‘Well, boys, it looks as if I have something that’s going to finish me off,’
  he said. These were his exact words, quite unforgettable in their devastating nonchalance. He had cancer. I have no idea what we said to him in reply. We were not, I think, terribly surprised, as
  we had been expecting bad news. He went to bed early, and we were left there, looking blankly at each other as midnight approached and we waited for the new year. My father received no remedial
  treatment for his illness, only palliative. He died in a hospice the following May. I remember feeling pleased for him that the spring weather was bright and warm, and that he had been able to
  spend some time on the balcony outside his room before he died.</p>
<p>My father, like all human beings, had plenty of faults, but the way he approached his death struck me, even in my callow youth, as immensely impressive, and I still admire him enormously for his
  calm, his stoicism and, in particular, his absence of self-pity as he faced the end of his life.</p>
<p>In 1784 Samuel Johnson lay dying, suffering from dropsy, now known as oedema, an abnormal accumulation of tissue fluid. He knew that he was going to die. The dropsy had spread from his chest to
  his feet. He asked his surgeon, William Cruikshaw, to cut into his legs to drain them. One of Johnson’s biographers, Walter Jackson Bate, continues:</p>
<p>Cruikshaw was afraid mortification might set in, and only gently lanced the surface. Johnson cried out: ‘Deeper, deeper; I want length of life, and you are afraid of
      giving me pain, which I do not value.’ . . . Later, when no one was looking, Johnson managed to get hold of a pair of scissors in a drawer near the bed, and plunged them deeply into the
      calves of each leg. The only result was a large effusion of blood . . . (Samuel Johnson: 598–9)</p>
<p>Like my father, Johnson displayed no self-pity. But he was far from calm and his stoicism was of a quite different kind. Two deaths, quite different, yet similarly admirable.
  There is no one good death, one good way to die. But this chapter looks at some of the thoughts that might help us face our own death, if not as nobly as my father and Johnson faced theirs, then at
  least with a modicum of dignity. This chapter, then, is about finding some consolation in and for the fact of our mortality. It is about the possibility of finding a good death.</p>
<p>Someone Dies</p>
<p>Tolstoy’s short story ‘The Death of Ivan Ilyich’ is one of the most powerful evocations of death one could imagine. In particular, Tolstoy brings out
  magnificently two central features of death: firstly, the absolute terror we can face if we think about our own death; secondly, that we find it impossible actually to imagine our own death: death
  is always, we like to think, something that happens to someone else. Tolstoy brings out Ivan’s thought concerning the latter quite brilliantly. Ivan, we read, had never dissented
  from those lessons in logic according to which we can deduce, from Julius Caesar’s being a man and the fact that all men are mortal, the conclusion that Caesar is mortal. However, writes
  Tolstoy, this</p>
<p>had always seemed to him to be true only when it applied to Caesar, certainly not to him. There was Caesar the man, and man in general, and it was fair enough for them, but
      he wasn’t Caesar the man and he wasn’t man in general . . . Did Caesar have anything to do with the smell of that little striped leather ball that Vanya [Ivan] had loved so much?
      Was it Caesar who had kissed his mother’s hand like that, and was it for Caesar that the silken folds of his mother’s dress had rustled in the way they did? (The Death of Ivan
      Ilyich and Other Stories: 193)</p>
<p>What is so marvellous in this passage is Tolstoy’s capacity to bring out the kind of fierce attachment we have to our own experience and the way in which this cannot be
  grasped from an outside perspective. There is clearly a sense in which, phenomenologically speaking, for each person, the only world that exists is his or her own world. Of course, I know that I
  share the planet with countless other human beings and that the reality of the world far outstrips my experience of it. But, for the person who dies, what ends is not simply his world, but
  the world. My world is the world because anything that wholly escapes my consciousness does not exist in my world and therefore is, for me, simply a blank. And when I say
  that things exist that outstrip my consciousness, they exist, nonetheless, as things that surpass me in this way, in my experience of them as beyond me, in my knowledge and sense of them as such.
  In this sense, they are not wholly unknown – they are mine as not known.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a sense in which I make my world. My values, needs, longings, hopes, fears, desires and so on all lead me to interpret the world in specific ways. Proust suggests
  that each human being is a denizen of an unknown country, unique to him or her alone. In this life we are aware of this but cannot express what that world is, yet we see this world as we
  do because of our provenance from elsewhere, from that unknown country. Only artists can express their world and, thanks to them, we are able to see this world in a new light. This is why we say
  that certain novelists, playwrights and so on, create a world that we can enter.</p>
<p>I am, of course, not making a moral judgement about individual egoism. I am, rather, seeking to capture a central aspect of how we each experience the world, that is, of the phenomenology of
  experience. And it is, I think, when we compare our idea of our own death with our idea of someone else’s that we become most acutely aware of the way in which, for each of us, everything
  that exists does so in our world alone. If someone else dies, however much I care about or love that person, life goes on, the world continues to exist. If I die, then there is – nothing.</p>
<p>Hence the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein remarked, ‘Death is not an event in life. We do not live to experience death’ (Tractatus: 6.4311). It is not just that there is
  nothing on the other side of death, but also that to try to imagine one’s own death is always to imagine it from someone else’s point of view. In a sense, Wittgenstein is saying that
  dying is like falling asleep: there is nothing that one can describe, from the inside, because the experience of falling asleep is empty – unlike, say, the experience of exhaustedly
  stretching out in bed to sleep. That moment at which sleep comes cannot be described from the inside. It is only when we wake up that it seems to be something, but that is an illusion.</p>
<p>Of course, some people think that they will wake up after death. They think that after death life goes on – say, with God. I do not presuppose such a view here. And it is, I think, because
  the end of my world is the end of the world that death is so terrifying.</p>
<p>‘Death is Nothing to Us’</p>
<p>In the ancient world, Epicurus and Lucretius picked up on the idea that the end of one’s world is the end of the world to suggest that, after all, we should not fear
  death. For, so the thought goes, when we are living, death is not present; and when we are dead, we do not exist to experience anything. So to suppose that death is bad for us, a misfortune, is to
  suppose, mistakenly, that we would be around, but dead, to experience this misfortune. But this is obviously not so. Hence, it is said, there is nothing to fear in death because, once it is there,
  we experience nothing. On this view, death is not a misfortune at all.</p>
<p>Not many of those who have reflected on this argument have found it convincing. It has seemed to them that the problem is that death remains a misfortune after all because the argument overlooks
  the deep attachment we have to our own experience of the kind that Tolstoy brings out. Even if it is true that I will not be around to experience my own death, death is still bad for me because
  what I want is my experience, my state of experiencing the world, to continue. This does not mean that life can never be burdensome, or worse. But even if life is utterly terrible, death
  can still be a misfortune – it is just the lesser of two evils, but still an evil.</p>
<p>This does not mean, of course, that there is no consolation to be found in our mortality, or that we cannot face our death with good grace or nobility.</p>
<p>Death and Reality</p>
<p>A friend of mine was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. During one conversation we had, she said something in particular that struck me powerfully. She said she felt a
  certain relief in the diagnosis because it brought her face-to-face with reality. What she meant was that the fact of her possible death made real what before had merely been an abstract thought
  for her – namely, that she is mortal. For, whilst it is true that we all know that we are mortal, we do not live in the light of that reality. It is a reality we suppress. We know it, but we
  do not acknowledge it. My friend was forced to acknowledge it, to grasp her reality as a vulnerable human being destined to die. That contact with the reality of her existence was, for her, a form
  of consolation. This is not the same as saying that she was not fearful in the face of death or that she wanted this illness, but it is to say that her contact with reality provided for her a sense
  that here, now, in her life, was something that she had always known was there but had concealed from herself.</p>
<p>A complementary way of looking at death is to be found in the reflections offered by Philip Gould, the Labour peer and strategist, who died of cancer in 2011. Gould wrote a book, When I
  Die, and made a short film with Adrian Steirn under the same title, about his experience of being diagnosed with cancer and knowing his death was imminent. What emerges from his reflections is
  the extremely powerful awareness that what helped him make sense of his experiences, indeed, find through them, in them, moments of joy and ecstasy, was his capacity to accept death, to face it as
  his reality. ‘[O]nly when you accept death,’ he wrote, ‘can you free yourself from it . . . Acceptance is the key’. In the moment of acceptance, he said, ‘you gain
  freedom . . . power . . . courage’ (When I Die: 118). Moreover, it is evident that what became important for Gould was a capacity to see not just the reality of his own situation but
  that his impending death could reconcile him to the world. He said that he felt at one with the world and, as part of that, emphasized the continuity of life and death.</p>
<p>This comes out particularly in two things he said in the film. Standing in the place where his grave would be, he said that thinking about his death was not a gloomy thing at all and that
  ‘the community of the living and the dead’, with people visiting his and others’ graves, was a ‘wonderful idea’. Just as significant is the following comment: ‘I
  saw my children born . . . and I saw the incredible massive potential of that moment. And when my father died, and the air left his body, it was as powerful as the air entering the body of
  my daughters.’ What Gould invokes is the way in which death is of a piece with life, indeed, with the start of life: there is an acceptance here of the endlessly turning, ceaseless
  cycle of all things natural, and the belief that only by accepting one’s own place in this cycle can one be reconciled to death.</p>
<p>Why is it that this kind of acceptance enables one to be released from the fear of death? What is really going on here? The answer is, I think, this. We spend our entire existence in a state of
  self-protection, self-defence. Everything we are by way of instinct, need and desire, leads us to seek our own security, the further progress of the self, the defence of what we are. The novelist
  and philosopher Iris Murdoch spoke in this context of ‘the fat relentless ego’ (The Sovereignty of Good: 52), and she had in mind that everything we do – from organizing
  our day as best we can for ourselves (work, leisure, holidays, projects and so on) to organizing our life more generally (career, marriage, children) – reflects and feeds from a kind of
  unthinking egoistic self-concern. This is not to say we are all selfish: after all, your welfare can enter into what I identify as what I am, and seek to protect. Regard for another is not
  disguised self-regard, but it is part of what one identifies as mattering to one and making one’s life worth defending and securing. And what is going on in cases like that of Gould is that,
  in the face of imminent death, this relentless self-concern drops away, because in such a situation there nothing left to defend. This means that the self can open out to the world and
  accept it in a way that is otherwise very rarely possible. And this is a source of joy, not least because it is an immense relief. This is why Gould said that he had had more moments of happiness
  and ecstasy in the last five months of his life than for many years before. Hence it is that, in a case like Gould’s, a sense of the reality of the self, its mortality, and of the reality of
  the world – really seeing the world, perhaps for the first time – come together. And this interconnection of reality, world and death, this sense that such a stance is
  possible, is, I think, something that might help us face death with less fear and a sense that it can be something more than merely an unmitigated loss. It remains a misfortune, but we can learn
  from cases such as that of Gould, and that of my friend, not to see it as only that.</p>
<p>I think we can put the point this way. Because the concepts of reality, world and death come together as we recognize they do in the case of someone like Gould, we can see that death is actually
  a central concept in our making sense of both ourselves and the world. In other words, and as many philosophers have said, our mortality is central to our capacity to make sense of the reality of
  the world. If we were to become immortal we would lose a key element in whatever it is that can make life meaningful. For this reason, death is not simply something that stands at the end of life,
  but is immanent in it. Our living involves, in this sense, the permanent presence of death. Living is dying and dying is living. This is why I have used the concept of dissolution for this
  chapter: our life is a form of dissolution – that is, the process of dying – and finds its apotheosis in the moment of death itself. We are dying all the time. For this reason,
  Heidegger said that we die, but the animals only perish, since they do not stand in the same relation to death as we do.</p>
<p>But this piece of knowledge about dissolution is something we suppress all the time because we are so fearful of death. What Gould makes us aware of is that we need to seek to live our life in
  the light of this knowledge if we are to make sense of both our death and our life. Usually we can only do this, if at all, towards the end. But what he encourages us to do is not to wait until
  then. If we can do that, we shall perhaps feel less fear of death.</p>
<p>Of course, this is, inevitably, something that we can do only partially, at best: the knowledge in question will wax and wane even in those who are most acutely conscious of it. Nonetheless,
  there are moments for some people when they are confronted by the reality of death and then they experience life as Gould did. For example, a friend of mine was told when she was twenty-three years
  old that she had cancer. The terror this engendered in her was accompanied by an acute sense of life in all its magnificent richness: the blue of the sky, the song of the birds and so on. She told
  me that she had the thought that she must retain this sense, come what may. In fact, the diagnosis was mistaken. But even now, years later, she sometimes thinks of that moment, aware that she
  learnt something vital then, and sorry that she cannot always see life as she did for that brief period. But if you have had a similar experience you might be able to mobilize the thoughts and
  feelings in question to give you a heightened sense of life precisely because you have a heightened sense of death – and vice versa.</p>
<p>Regrets</p>
<p>In a way, Gould was lucky: he died surrounded by people he loved and who loved him, and in material comfort, with doctors to advise and care for him, and in pain but not always
  so much pain as to make him, for example, incapable of thought or reflection. Moreover, he was in his sixties when he died, not especially young, and had led a full and active life.</p>
<p>But someone who discovers or believes he is going to die might be in a quite different situation: if he is young, he might be especially struck by a sense of waste, of missed opportunities, or,
  whether young or not, he may feel that he has made a mess of his life and be filled with painful regrets at this thought. Indeed, the latter is the case with Ivan Ilyich, who comes to see, as he
  lies dying, that he has lived a lie, that his life has been all wrong. At first he is filled with horror, regret and terror. But even in this case, Ivan finds consolation: his impending death has
  forced him to be honest with himself about his life for the first time. He finally grasps that he has lived a life wholly in the eyes of others, accepting their judgements of value and taste
  without ever questioning whether they were really his judgements about things. His life has been devoid of depth, of serious reflection and of insight into his own condition. He has never
  given any heed to that maxim of the Delphic oracle: ‘Know thyself’. When he finally sees that this is so, he has the consolation that he has at least some insight into the reality of
  his life.</p>
<p>The sense of regret at the prospect of death comes over very strongly in something that Primo Levi says in his book The Periodic Table. After his arrest by the fascists and before his
  deportation to Auschwitz, he was held in a cell and interrogated. He believed that he was going to be killed at the end of the interrogations. He writes:</p>
<p>Life can hit you with all its force when you are acutely aware of your mortality.</p>
<p>In those days in which I waited for death fairly courageously I harboured a piercing desire for everything, for all conceivable human experiences, and I cursed my life up
      until then, which, so it seemed to me, I had exploited too little and badly, and I felt time pouring through my fingers, slipping away from my body minute by minute, like a haemorrhage which
      cannot be stopped. (Il sistema periodico: 141)</p>
<p>Levi was at the time only in his early twenties and was, by his own account, a rather shy and awkward young man, somewhat naive and intimidated by the world. But whatever his
  regrets might have been, he bore the thought of his imminent death with great courage and dignity. This is clear not so much from what he says as the manner in which he says it – the
  tone, the style of his writing, which has always impressed his readers as immensely sober and judicious. And there is a very important point here for us if we wish to think about
  our own attitude to death and how we might find something valuable or worthwhile in our mortality. This is that here, as in many other places in life, it really is a matter less of what
  one does than of how one does it. No one else can die my death for me. It is an event which marks one’s absolute solitude or loneliness, for, however much help one might have by way
  of palliative care or the like, death is something that has to be faced alone in a very radical sense. It is partly this that makes it so frightening. And in this we see the extraordinary equality
  of all human beings, together with the uniqueness of each human death: we all die, but we each die our own death. To confront one’s own death, one needs to find one’s own way,
  one’s own style, as it were, and for that there can be no formulae – though it can be helpful to see how others have confronted their death.</p>
<p>Is Death the Worst that Can Befall Us?</p>
<p>In any case, what Levi came to realize is that there are things worse than death, and this very thought can be helpful to us in facing our own demise.</p>
<p>Levi was well aware that the ancient philosophers were much preoccupied with death and the fear of death. They thought that central to virtue was a kind of contempt for death, and they even
  conceived of the practice of philosophy as a preparation for death, since it requires a kind of contemplation disassociated from the body, which thus resembles death and is a kind of preparation
  for it.</p>
<p>Montaigne summed up much of this wisdom on overcoming the fear of death in his essay ‘To philosophize is to learn how to die’, pointing out the many different ways in which death can
  carry us off – one example he gives is that of his own brother, who was struck by a ball just above the right ear whilst playing tennis, and ‘five or six hours after . . . died from an
  apoplexy caused by the blow’– in order to remind us that we can die at pretty much any moment and thus have to prepare ourselves for it.</p>
<p>He offers a number of suggestions. We should, he says, deprive death of its strangeness by thinking about it often, including when we are enjoying ourselves, and he writes approvingly of the
  ancient Egyptians, who ‘in the midst of their banquets and celebrations . . . would bring a skeleton in to serve as a warning to their guests’. He tells us also that we should, like
  him, when we are reading or chatting to people, find out how different individuals died, in order to model ourselves on those who died well. ‘Whoever taught men how to die would teach them
  how to live’, he comments in his typically laconic manner. What Montaigne has in mind is the idea we have already encountered that life itself is deeply bound up with death, in the sense that
  the whole of life is a progression towards death. ‘[The] being which you enjoy is a part equally of death and life,’ he writes, and forms part of the ‘interweaving of
  things’ in nature. Because we are always dying whilst alive, all ‘that you live, you rob from life, living at her expense’ (‘Que philosopher, c’est apprendre
  à mourir’: 131–138). We should see ourselves, Montaigne suggests, as part of the cycle of life and death, and be willing to relinquish gracefully what has only been loaned
  to us, so to speak. He also suggests that we should try to view our individual lives from the perspective of eternity. Consider, he says, those tiny creatures which live for one day: it makes no
  difference from our perspective if one such creature dies at eight in the morning or at five in the afternoon and, similarly, from the perspective of infinity it makes no difference if we live a
  long or short life.</p>
<p>Not everyone will find any or all of these arguments useful in seeking to find consolation in the face of death. But I would certainly recommend reflection on them to see if you might find them
  of help. Levi, however, as I intimated earlier, rejected the idea that the proper object of philosophical reflection should be death. In his book If This is a Man, he speaks of ‘the
  demolition of a man’ that went on in Auschwitz: the reduction of human beings to the state or level of animals, as he put it, a procedure that was carried out by depriving the prisoners of
  all their possessions, stripping them naked, making them defecate and urinate in public, shaving them, and replacing their names with numbers. Levi spoke of this as the destruction of the
  personality and, amazed at how quickly and easily such destruction can take place, he wrote that</p>
<p>our personality is fragile, and much more in danger than our life; and the ancient sages, instead of admonishing us to ‘remember that you must die’ would have
      done better to remind us of this greater danger that menaces us. (Se questo è un uomo: 48)</p>
<p>Montaigne thought that one of the central reasons to fear death was that everyone is subject to it, whereas other misfortunes are not in this way inevitable. And he is, of
  course, right about that. Given that this is so, we might well side with Montaigne and seek consolation for our mortality in the kind of way he suggests. But we might think, otherwise, that
  Levi’s point provides consolation for our mortality precisely because we come to see that it is not the worst that can befall us, even if it is inevitable – as the destruction of the
  personality, thankfully, is not. We might, that is to say, be able to face death better if we see that a worse fate has not afflicted us in our lives, find gratitude in ourselves to life for that
  and hence see death as something to be feared less. At any rate, Levi’s thought, or what I have derived from it, joins hands here with Montaigne, since the latter suggests that if we have had
  a good life we should seek to be grateful for this and leave life as we leave a feast – replete and satisfied. And, Montaigne goes on, ‘if you have never learned how to use life, if
  life is useless to you, what does it matter to you if you have lost it?’ – that is, if you die? (Que philosopher, c’est apprendre à mourir: 139). If, as Hume
  suggested, we all have a tendency to ‘complain at once of the shortness of life, and of its vanity and sorrow’ – ‘such is the greatness of human misery, it reconciles even
  contradictions’, he remarks tersely (Dialogues and Natural History of Religion: 100) – then what, in their different ways, Levi and Montaigne are seeking to do is to break us
  of this contradiction by helping us to be grateful for what we have and for this very reason better able to let it go when the time comes. The solution to death is found in how one lives.</p>
<p>Meditating upon death may well take from us some of our fear of it.</p>
<p>Death and the Act of Dying</p>
<p>I have so far not clearly distinguished death itself, the fact of being dead, from the process or act of dying – the physical collapse of the body. But the distinction is
  important because it is possible to fear one and not the other. Simone de Beauvoir, for example, in her book about her mother’s last months, A Very Easy Death, reports at one point
  the demeanour of both her maternal grandmother and her father in the face of death. ‘My grandmother,’ she writes,</p>
<p>was aware that she was dying. She said quite happily: ‘I am going to eat a last little boiled egg, and then I shall go to rejoin Gustave.’ She had never put much
      energy into living. At the age of eighty-four, she vegetated morosely: dying did not disturb her. (Une mort très douce: 107–8)</p>
<p>And of her father she writes that,</p>
<p>[he] did not show less courage. ‘Ask your mother to send no priest. I don’t want to play a comedy,’ he said to me. And he gave me certain instructions on
      practical matters. Financially ruined, bitter, he accepted nothingness as serenely as grandmother accepted paradise. (Une mort très douce: 108)</p>
<p>No doubt both of these people had reasons to accept death as they did, reasons to do with the compromised nature of their individual lives. But, of course, everyone’s
  life is compromised in some way and, moreover, de Beauvoir saw them both as courageous. Like Philip Gould, they were not frightened of death, of the state of being dead. So a question we must ask
  ourselves is whether we are frightened of death itself or only the act of dying. Without being honest with ourselves about that, we cannot, I think, begin to cope with the fear in question. We each
  have to reflect on this for ourselves.</p>
<p>De Beauvoir’s mother, who died of cancer, was frightened of both death and dying. Yet, despite her Catholic faith, she did not seek the aid of a priest during her terrible illness, and she
  did not pray, something which is to be explained, says de Beauvoir, by the fact that, for her, prayer was ‘an exercise that demanded attention and reflection, a certain state of the
  soul’ (Une mort très douce: 107), and it would therefore have exhausted her. De Beauvoir continues:</p>
<p>She knew what she should have said to God: ‘Heal me. But thy will be done: I accept death.’ But she did not accept it. In this moment of truth, she did not want
      to utter insincere words. Nonetheless, she did not grant herself the right to rebel. She remained silent: ‘God is good.’ . . . In any case, Mother feared neither God nor the devil:
      simply leaving the world. (Une mort très douce: 107)</p>
<p>But even she had moments of ‘joy’ and, at times, was ‘at peace with herself’, finding, ‘on this death bed, a kind of happiness’ (Une
  mort très douce: 71). This is not to suggest that she did not suffer terribly. It is simply to insist that, despite that suffering, she found something in the process of dying that was
  positive. In her case, this was because, says de Beauvoir, for the first time in her life, she really gave herself over, without scruple, to her desires and to pleasure.</p>
<p>None of this is to deny that many die awful, wretched deaths, even in developed, affluent parts of the world with good medical services. But it is to say that, if we are lucky, and if we open
  ourselves to this possibility, even the process of dying can give us something. I am sure that central to that luck is the love or friendship of others. In death, as I mentioned earlier, we are
  alone, but the affections of others can do something to mitigate that.</p>
<p>In considering why her mother’s faith could not console her for her death, de Beauvoir compares the immortality that religion might offer and that offered by her own fame from being a
  writer. She says: ‘Religion could do no more for my mother than could the hope of posthumous success for me. Whether one imagines it as celestial or terrestrial, immortality does not console
  one for death if one is attached to life’ (Une mort très douce: 108). The point here is that immortality as offered by religion is, whatever else it is, not the same as
  immortality here on earth, and for some religious believers it may precisely be the latter that they want – or, if not immortality, at least more life here below. And of course a non-believer
  might want that too. Woody Allen made much the same point in his typically droll manner when he remarked: ‘I don’t want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve
  immortality through not dying’. And when he was asked if he would like to live on in the hearts of others, he replied: ‘I would like to live on in my apartment’ (The
  Illustrated Woody Allen Reader: 250; 259).</p>
<p>But it may be a matter of temperament whether one finds consolation after all in the way in which the dead can live on in the hearts of others. One of the things that makes such a thought more
  difficult for those in the modern age is the way in which death has been stripped of much of its ritual quality and removed to the edges of our lives: death is not a permanent presence for us, as
  it was for those of previous ages. We have created a world in which death has no place. De Beauvoir brings this out forcefully when she reflects on the things she sees in the shop windows whilst
  her mother lies dying in a clinic:</p>
<p>Perfumes, furs, lingerie, jewels: luxurious arrogance of a world where death does not have its place. But it is crouching behind this façade, in the secret greyness
      of clinics, hospitals, closed rooms. And I no longer know any other truth. (Une mort très douce: 92)</p>
<p>We are in denial most of the time about death, which is one of the reasons why those, like Gould, who have written about their own experience of dying stress again and again
  the importance of being honest with themselves that this is what is happening – that they are dying. Such honesty does not defeat death, but, Gould says, it does provide freedom from it. Ivan
  too, in Tolstoy’s story, only becomes free when he finally acknowledges that he is dying and that there is nothing he can do to change that.</p>
<p>In any case, there is a sense in which the dead live on, though I do not mean this in any superstitious or literal way. I know, for example, that my father – what he did and how
  he lived his life, for good and ill – is often present to me in my thoughts and feelings, and I seek still to learn from the manner in which he lived. In Thoughts on Happiness Alain
  writes, that</p>
<p>[t]he dead are not dead, which is clear enough, since we live. The dead think, speak and act; they can advise, desire, approve, blame. All that is true. But it is necessary
      to hear it. All that is in us; all that is really alive in us. (Propos sur le bonheur: 143)</p>
<p>As Alain says, visiting the graves of the dead can, if we listen carefully, return us to life, because the dead have much to say to us. And, we may add, there is little doubt
  that the dead more generally, including those one has never known, can play a large part in one’s inner life, in one’s thoughts and feelings. Through books, films, photographs, music
  and so on, they speak to us, if only we listen carefully. In an interview, the writer W. G. Sebald was happy to be called a ‘ghost hunter’, and his work expresses very finely the
  attempt to listen carefully to the dead. As he says: ‘I have always had at the back of my mind this notion that . . . these people [the dead] aren’t really gone, they just hover
  somewhere at the perimeter of our lives and keep coming in on brief visits’ (‘Ghost Hunter’: 39). In his writings, Sebald teaches us how we might listen. As he says in another
  interview:</p>
<p>The attitude for which I strive – and this is something that one has to learn – is an attitude of mourning. Not in any sentimental sense, but rather the full
      awareness that one is seeing something that is disappearing: a body, a society, a state, a part of nature or whatever. (‘Eine Trauerhaltung lernen’: 115)</p>
<p>Although, of course, Sebald is speaking here of more than individual human beings, it is clear that we can apply what he says more narrowly to those who are dead. His writings
  seek, as I have said, to make us attentive. They do so because they are infinitely focused, with a kind of grieving love, on the details of individual lives and on what the people in question made
  of them. The fact that Sebald himself died in 2001, adds to what we can learn from him: he is a ghost speaking of ghosts, a dead writer who speaks of death, and in this way he invites us to be less
  frightened of death by drawing us towards seeing our own death as part of an inevitable cycle of things that has its own melancholy beauty.</p>
<p>As I say, it may be a matter of temperament whether these kinds of reflections can console us in, and for, our own death. But if you find consolation in them, it might be that you can also find
  such, as Gould suggests, in a sense of community with those already dead. To die is to enter into the realm of those who have already died, as if one were now to join them. At any rate, I find
  something consoling in that thought. Most of the men and women I admire are dead, and I have the sense that, when I die, I shall join them, not in any literal way, but simply in the sense that then
  I shall be numbered amongst them. And I am not alone in having some such a sense of things. De Beauvoir, in her account of her mother’s illness and death, tells of the funeral. Sitting with
  her sister in the hearse, she looked at the coffin in which their mother’s body was laid. De Beauvoir reports what her sister said and then makes a comment:</p>
<p>‘The only thing that consoles me,’ she said to me, ‘is that I too will go that way. Without that, it would be too unfair!’ Yes. We were taking part
      in the dress rehearsal for our own burial. (Une mort très douce: 117)</p>
<p>De Beauvoir’s sister’s sentiment may not have been exactly the same as my sense of joining the dead, but it certainly expresses a kind of solidarity or community
  with the dead. It expresses a similar sense of going to join the dead, and clearly her sister thought of this in terms of a kind of justice. I do not know whether that made her better able to
  confront her own mortality and integrate it more seamlessly into her life, but it certainly opens up such a possibility.</p>
<p>My sense about these things is also this: those men and women I admire, and who have died, have managed to achieve something – precisely, their death. And that gives me a powerful feeling
  that, if they were able to do this, so can I. I have the sense that it cannot be as bad as all that if they have done it. I think here of all the times in my life when I have been
  frightened by some difficult challenge and, in the end, things turned out to be easier than I had imagined. I am always surprised at how resilient human beings are when things are very difficult.
  Gould says of his cancer treatment that before it began he thought he would simply be unable to cope with it. But cope with it he did. And then he was told that he would never eat normally, and he
  got used to that too. ‘Then you realise – whatever they throw at you, you can deal with it’. He managed to cope even with his ‘[e]ndless, endless pain’ (When I
  Die: 121; 122). He did not in any sense value his pain, and he wanted it reduced as much as possible, but it did, he says, give him a sense that now, for the first time he understood what pain
  was, and therefore could understand the pain of others. To that extent, it clearly opened him to the world.</p>
<p>Changing Attitudes</p>
<p>In the modern bourgeois world we place an enormous emphasis upon the security of the individual. This has no doubt brought many benefits, but it has, along with other things,
  such as secularization and the advance of medical science, also unquestionably made us much more intolerant of pain than those of previous ages were. It has also made us more fearful of death. In
  his essay ‘On the Fear of Death’, William Hazlitt was scathing about this aspect of modern life. Speaking of the tendency to cling to life as such in our modern, civilized world, he
  comments that in the past people threw themselves</p>
<p>into all the vicissitudes and dangers of war, or staked their all upon a single die, or some one passion, which if they could not have gratified, life became a burden to
      them – now our strongest passion is to think, our chief amusement is to read new plays, new poems, new novels, and this we may do at our leisure, in perfect security . . . A life of
      action and danger moderates the dread of death. It not only gives us fortitude to bear pain, but teaches us at every step the precarious tenure on which we hold our present being. (‘On
      the Fear of Death’: 479–80)</p>
<p>The complaint is, as J. P. Stern put it when discussing some aspects of the modern condition, that we live in an age of the ‘atrophy of the heart and the dulling of the
  senses[,] in a world where conformism and commerce, the civil service and bourgeois taboos, have taken the place of heroism and adventure’ (Idylls and Realities: 37). Of course,
  death was feared in the past, but security was not considered to be of supreme value. Death itself, in the pursuit of some good, could be seen as something deeply worthy. We do not see things this
  way, not even when we feel that it might be better to die than to live, as in cases of acute and pointless pain. Even when we speak of heroic deaths, as in war or in other acts of courage or
  valour, we see such death as an exception that confirms our general attitude. We have very little understanding of what Nietzsche called, in a striking phrase, ‘der verschwenderische
  Geist’, the squandering spirit. Because we place so much emphasis on individual security, we no longer really understand those characters from the past who squandered themselves by
  living at the limits of their capacities, pushing themselves to the point where they risked destroying themselves, not least because they often risked destroying others in the process. One good
  example, to which I have already referred, is that given by Antony and Cleopatra in their magnificent egoism. The writings of the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig are replete with examples –
  indeed, his work is in many ways a kind of lament for the loss of such figures, or their increasingly rare occurrence in the modern world: Magellan, Balzac, Casanova, among others.</p>
<p>Of course, one must not exaggerate, and there are modern exceptions, in the arts or sport, but even here the bureaucratization of existence has made such inroads that these areas of life have
  become massively over-professionalized and regulated. It would be a romantic fantasy to suppose that we could go back to living as earlier ages did. Nonetheless, in Nietzsche’s idea of the
  squandering spirit there is a lesson in how to think productively about death, and with less fear. For it is open to us to see our life much more in terms of a kind of venture or quest than we
  often do. Focused on making our external lives as secure as possible, we forget that we can make our inner life a scene of the most extraordinary adventure, and that we can challenge ourselves much
  more than we suppose we can. Our inner life can be much more like the kind Hazlitt imagined, a life of action and danger. We effectively smother such a possibility by our relentless desire for
  happiness and our deep incapacity to accept suffering – melancholy, disappointment, loss and so on – as completely and utterly normal, by our secret – and sometimes not so secret
  – suspicion, or fantasy, that these things have no real place in the world. A quite different possibility, more in line with Hazlitt’s view, is well articulated by the opening passage
  of Hermann Hesse’s novel Gertrude:</p>
<p>When I look back across my life from the outside, it does not seem especially happy. Nonetheless, I can with even less justice call it unhappy, despite all the errors. It is
      in the end also quite foolish to ask about happiness and unhappiness, for it seems to me that I would give up the unhappiest days of my life with more difficulty than all the cheerful ones. If
      in a human life the task is to accept the inevitable clearsightedly, to suffer good and evil fully, and to conquer an inner, more authentic, non-contingent destiny next to one’s external
      destiny, then my life has been neither poor nor bad. If my external destiny has passed over me as over all other people, inevitably and as decreed by the gods, nonetheless my inner destiny has
      been my own work, whose sweetness or bitterness is mine, and for which I consider that I alone should accept the responsibility. (Gertrud: 7)</p>
<p>We are back to the sense of the immanence of death in life. For, if you manage to see your life in the way Hesse expresses, you might be able to see your death not as something
  dreadful that stands at the end of your life, but rather as something that you have earned, worked for, something that is worthy of you. Whether it arrives suddenly or slowly, your death could be
  something that you make fully your own because you see it as being at one with your life, as being something that you live each day, just as you make yours the rest of what happens to you
  by carving out of it an inner destiny parallel to your external destiny. To that extent, as I suggested earlier, the fact that we are mortal is central to the meaning we can find in life.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein recommended to his pupils that they ‘go the bloody hard way’, by which he meant that philosophy should never be a mere intellectual or academic pursuit but should be
  bound up with one’s whole being, so that it helps one see what one really thinks and not simply what one thinks one thinks because it is convenient or fashionable
  or impressive or useful for career purposes. I am suggesting that there is something in what Wittgenstein says for life more generally. What matters is much less the length of your life than the
  spirit in which you live it. The struggle to live in a spirit of integrity is also a struggle to see one’s mortality for what it is, to live one’s mortality, precisely because
  it is inevitable and, as part of our external destiny, needs to be made one’s own in the inner life.</p>
<p>This is the deepest lesson that Tolstoy’s Ivan Ilyich has to teach us: his living a lie was his living without integrity, without really making anything his own, and it was
  precisely for this reason that he was so terrified of death. Being an individual is not so much a matter of doing what others have not done or do not do, as it is a matter of doing it in a spirit
  expressive of your whole being. If you do this, then, as Gould says, you do not beat death; but death cannot beat you.</p>
