        <h2>Self-compassion</h2>
<p>The more we start to understand the origins of our fearful worldview, the more we may decide that we have the right to do something which we have perhaps indulged in very little over the years: feel sorry for ourselves.</p>
<p>By their nature, our characters are likely to resist the temptation to take our side. We may feel that we’re not the sort to weep over our fate or feel that we have been given a particularly bad set of cards. And yet, the more we revisit the past and consequently get a handle on the causes of our fears, the more we may allow ourselves one or two moments of compassion for the experiences we’ve been exposed to and their repercussions down the decades. We have grown into fear-laden people because, when we were far too young to interpret and manage what was happening, we were let down. Someone shouted at us inordinately and didn’t allow us to get annoyed back. Someone told us that we would only ever be acceptable if we achieved extraordinary things. Someone gave us the impression that we didn’t deserve to succeed. Someone didn’t come to soothe us when we were screaming in the night and was unable to equip us with the tools to dampen our panic and sorrows in adult life. These people may not have intended to cause harm, but we have been severely wounded nevertheless.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, we are afraid of failure because we were not properly loved. We were not held, reassured, calmed down, delighted in and accepted unconditionally. We believe that the world is filled with risks, not because we face unprecedented obstacles, but because we have unusually difficult histories. The catastrophe we apprehend has in fact already happened, but until now we have found it too hard to think about it. We were too busy working, trying to impress or fending off imagined enemies.</p>
<p>But now, in a quiet corner of our minds, we can finally take the chance to behave like a loving parent towards our frightened and frantic inner self. We can sit ourselves on our own knee, stroke our own forehead, hold our own hand and tell ourselves that we are – whatever we may think – a very interesting and kindly person whom it is a privilege to know and to look after. We can congratulate ourselves on how hard we have tried and what enormous efforts we have made. We can tell ourselves that perhaps now is a time for change – that there has been enough endless material and status striving, enough jockeying for position and hope for preferment, enough busyness and exhaustion, self-flagellation and masochism. Now, instead, there is a chance to reorient our lives towards greater relational warmth. We can whisper, away from the sarcastic and brutal alternative voices who still like to shout inside us, that the time for fear has come to an end – and that a reign of love and safety can begin.</p>
