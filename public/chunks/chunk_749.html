        <h2>A SELF-PORTRAIT</h2>
<p>Our societies sometimes struggle with the question of what art might be for. Here the answer feels simple: Art is a weapon against despair. It is a tool with which to alleviate a sense of crushing isolation and uniqueness. It provides common ground where the sadness in me can, with dignity and intelligence, meet the sadness in you.</p>
<p>Perhaps for a long time, the man in the diner kept it together. As late as this morning, he might have believed that, despite everything, he would be OK. He’d taken his hat along with him, as always; he remained attached to appearances. Even as his anguish mounted, he kept going, one sip of coffee after another, an occasional pat of the mouth with a paper napkin, while looking out at the busy room: secretaries at lunch, people from the nearby construction site, a few exhausted mothers and their kids. Then, suddenly, there was no more arguing with the despair any longer. It swept him up without any chance of a rejoinder: the mess he had made, the fool he had become in everyone’s eyes, the absurdity of everything. His head hit the table with a shocking clatter but almost at once it was absorbed by the dense murmur of the room and the city. One could die in public here and few would notice.</p>
<p>Except that there was a French photographer right opposite who was very much into noticing everything: an elegant, willowy man, with a name impossible for Americans to pronounce—he invited them to call him Harry—and a Leica 35 around his neck. Henri Cartier-Bresson had wandered the area all morning; he’d shot a group of women chatting outside on Ground Street and discovered a striking view of midtown Manhattan from the promenade. He had just begun his lunch when, without warning, there came that distinctive bang of a head hitting a table with force.</p>
<p>We need not feel ashamed, the photograph suggests, that we are in despair; it is an inevitable part of being alive. The distress that normally dwells painfully and privately inside our minds has been given social expression—and no longer needs to be shouldered alone. Whatever a distressingly upbeat world sometimes implies, it is normal, very normal, to be in agony. We don’t, on top of it all, ever need to feel unique for being unwell.</p>
