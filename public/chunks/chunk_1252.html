        <h2>The Hotel Room</h2>
<p>There is a particularly intense kind of loneliness that can descend on us when we’re meant to feel like we belong somewhere — but don’t. We might be with a partner whose understanding of, and interest in, us doesn’t match what we long for in the private and vulnerable corners of our minds. Or we might be with close friends who fail to ask us about ourselves, who talk again and again about their skiing holidays and who withdraw when we try to bring up more sincere topics. This is meant to be our family, so why is there so much distance and so much underlying suspicion? Few questions are more painful.</p>
<p>It may seem as if we would only aggravate the loneliness by coming to certain places: isolated diners late at night, empty service stations in the early hours, bleak railway stations in winter or — as in this case — a sterile synthetic hotel room in a gigantic anonymous hotel on the edge of a city where we know no one.</p>
<p>And yet, paradoxically, so-called lonely places do not have to make us feel lonely. Indeed, their unmistakable alienation renders public, and so more acceptable, sentiments that otherwise reside in us in shame. These places seem to tell us that there is nothing unusual in feeling adrift from friends or family or in having lost our bearings. They rehabilitate sadness through their own desolation. We’re not alone in being alone.</p>
<p>In this hotel room, there is no more pretence. The bleakness of existence is confirmed by the traffic roaring along a motorway far below, the peculiar stain on the bedcover and the sound of someone else’s television through the wall. And yet we might develop a strange love for this monk’s cell, this place at the end of the world. We don’t need to fake our smiles. We are lost and the hotel knows it. It doesn’t demand good cheer. Everyone else seems similarly abandoned and forlorn, like the cast of a ghost ship adrift in an icy ocean. In the hundreds of rooms identical to this one, we won’t be the only ones wondering where it all went wrong and longing for someone to understand. Without anyone planning for this, we’re a community of sorts.</p>
<p>It is easier to feel at home here than in the home that has let us down. We can find a fellowship of the fallen and of the exiled. Whatever the physical ugliness of this room and this hotel, we sense a psychological welcome, and the lonesomeness speaks to the lost pilgrim inside us. In a place where everyone is an outsider, we can start to feel like we belong.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that we are, by nature, shy and have been since childhood. We try hard to avoid unfamiliar situations. We don’t go to parties where we know no one. We’re awkward around strangers. We blush if we’re singled out. Going into shops or conveying our intentions to busy, indifferent officials is a trial. We’re always keen to try to get someone else to ask for directions.</p>
<p>But no such diffidence will work here, in Abidjan, the largest city of Côte d’Ivoire on the Gulf of Guinea. No one will pay any attention unless we find our voice. The assumption is that, if it’s important, surely we will say so — even if that’s never quite the way it has been for us.</p>
<p>It’s Mariame’s role to change the tablecloths after the breakfast sitting and prepare the room for morning snacks and lunch. She’s originally from Bounkani in the northeast and has been working here for six years. She has two children and lives with her uncle in a high-rise in Abobo, an hour away by bus.</p>
<p>We may need to leave home in order to expand our personalities and harness new skills. It won’t work to look sheepish and hope to be rescued, now that we’re on our own here. We have to gather up our courage and speak — and can stand to make immense discoveries, about ourselves and others, if we do so.</p>
<p>It turns out that Mariame is only too keen to chat; we just had to dare to start. She has a ready laugh and a wry manner. She fetches us a slice of pineapple and coconut cake — though the kitchen is officially shut. She tells us about her brother who is setting up a building company in Koumassi after studying in Germany for two years. She wonders if it’s our first visit and what book we’re reading. She supports the city’s football team, Stella Club d’Adjamé, and loves Miriam Makeba and Beethoven.</p>
<p>It no longer matters how different we look and how distant were our introductions to life. The similarities are, in the end, of far greater significance. This is what the shy person refuses to accept. They are repeatedly fooled by appearances; they make too much of the externals. It’s our provincialism of the spirit that a visit to Abidjan (or Trondheim or Amarbayasgalant) has an opportunity to correct. We can learn that we all suffer and long in similar ways, that anyone could be our friend, that we are a single human community, constantly hemmed into small tribes by fear.</p>
<p>The next day, we go back and Mariame is there again. We greet each other like old friends. She mentions that she isn’t too bad but her knee is giving her trouble. She’s brought along a photo of her little Seydou, recently turned 5, in the green stripes of his favourite local team. The universe has expanded.</p>
