<p>‘Symmetry’, a TV ad for Marie Curie Cancer Care, attracted almost universal praise when it was launched in 2013. It intercut moving scenes of a baby’s first steps, first birthday, first shave, first awkward teenage kiss, with last experiences – a couple’s last tender touch, a last shave, a last kiss. The caption read: ‘Your last moments should mean as much as your first.’ Part of an appeal to raise money for good end-of-life care, the ad was seen as an admirable contribution to breaking the taboos around death.</p>
<p>But it was also innovative in another, less obvious way: it showed an entire human lifespan. As its director Tom Tagholm pointed out, ‘It is putting death into a different context, the context of life.’</p>
<p>Contrast this with an exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science in 2000. In a booth open only to children under 15, participants had their photo taken and then, at the press of a button, a simulation appeared, showing what they’d look like at yearly intervals until the age of 69. The computer added grotesque pouches and blotches, elongated and sagged their faces and gave them heavily rutted lines. The boys lost their hair. No one looked good, reported the cultural critic Margaret Morganroth Gullette, let alone humorous, contented or beautiful – the software engineers had based the algorithm on ‘older equals uglier’. No wonder the children emerged shaken, saying ‘I don’t want to grow old.’</p>
<p>The Boston exhibit embodied a whole set of entrenched cultural beliefs that prevent us from seeing our lives as a single, finite entity. It estranged the children from their future selves, encouraging in them instead the desire to freeze it at one particular age. Welcome to the world of anti-ageing: for, as these children grow, they’ll encounter many more reasons to fear their own ageing, making it even harder for them to conceive of their lives as an entity.</p>
<p>Life as a whole</p>
<p>The concept of a lifespan or life cycle is becoming increasingly alien to us. Yet the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, who identified eight stages of psychosocial development from infancy to late adulthood, regarded each one of them as crucial. ‘As we come to the last stage [old age], we become aware of the fact that our civilization really does not harbour a concept of the whole of life.’</p>
<p>The final stage, Erikson maintained, offers us the opportunity to establish an integrated self, to draw on the sustenance of the past (good memories, experiences and achievements) while still retaining a vital involvement in the present. It gives us the chance to see our lives as a whole, to come to terms with its meaning, purpose and shape, instead of thinking of it as a series of discrete, atomized stages.</p>
<p>There’s an important reason for reconceiving our lives in this way before we reach old age. Connecting with our future self allows us to develop earlier on the resources that will serve us best later – resources like the ability to make new friends when we lose old ones, to accept help graciously, to value internal resources at least as much as external ones, and to be able to let go. Without this earlier work, we have to face old age bereft of the capacities necessary to flourish in those years, when they’re harder (though not impossible) to develop.</p>
<p>The values most admired by advanced industrial societies and the market – a single-minded focus on productivity – are precisely those of least help with ageing. People who live their earlier lives as if they’re never going to age often find retirement and the loss of a professional identity particularly traumatic: they’ve failed to cultivate those qualities that can endure, and without the containing structure imposed by work, even if they complained about it at the time, they’re at a loss.</p>
<p>Our younger selves</p>
<p>There’s another compelling reason for re-establishing the link between our younger and older selves: because they’re so viscerally enmeshed. Poor nutrition in early childhood, for instance, has been linked to high blood pressure in old age. In addition, researchers at King’s College London have found that twenty-two molecules already present when we’re born are linked to our health in old age. And emotional resilience as we age is related to our earliest experiences of being cared for. Such vivid connections, physiological and psychological, between the two ends of life – and of course everything that lies in between.</p>
<p>Although we live in a Peter Pan culture where youth is the yardstick, young people need to be reimagined, too, since they’re also harmed by ageist ideas and even by age resistance. Idealizing youth at the expense of age, for instance, conceals how hard it often is to be young. (And when young people don’t live up to our unattainable vision of them – as of course they can’t – they’re then demonized as ‘feral’.) Youth and age get polarized and the years in between stereotyped (‘middle-aged’ is rife with connotations, most of them undesirable). This distorts the fact that flux and change are inevitable throughout the life course.</p>
<p>Our future selves</p>
<p>One way of widening our vision so that it includes the entire lifespan is by identifying with older people. And no one has described this more beautifully than Henri Nouwen. Nouwen viewed ageing as one of the most essential human processes, one that could be denied only with great harm. In a slim cowritten volume called Aging: The Fulfillment of Life, first published in 1974, the Dutch-born Catholic priest urges us to break through the artificial boundaries between the generations. We must resist the temptation to make ageing into the problem of old people, he argues passionately, because it’s a way of denying that we too are implicated in the process. Instead he wants us ‘to allow the elderly to cure us of our separatist tendencies and bring us into a closer and more intimate contact with our own ageing.’</p>
<p>In an ageist culture this is no easy task. But to care for the ageing, he insists, we need to ‘make ourselves available to the experience of becoming old … [to allow] an old man or woman to come alive in the center of our own existence.’ This is a profound act of empathy and humanity, and can open the door to a powerful emotional maturing and growth. But we can’t take the step if we feel the need to disavow old people because they remind us of our own mortality.</p>
<p>Disowning weakness</p>
<p>Another way of making the ageing process less frightening is by reclaiming some of the feelings of fragility that we’ve offloaded onto old people. This is one of the most important psychological mechanisms through which most of us protect ourselves from the knowledge that all of us are ageing, all of us will die and none of us is invincible. We disown the feelings of weakness and vulnerability that arise at every stage of life, youth included, and transfer them instead into older people. With such a heavy load of fragility to bear – their own and that belonging to the rest of us – no wonder they’re always shown with walking sticks and Zimmer frames. Who could walk energetically and upright carrying such cargo?</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde created the most brilliant and graphic example of this sort of psychological ‘splitting’ in The Picture of Dorian Gray: here the portrait has to suffer all the visible signs of ageing that the narcissistic young man who was its sitter can’t tolerate.</p>
<p>Projection like this is a cause of elder abuse: the despised part of the self is split off, attributed to someone else and can then be damaged without, apparently, hurting oneself. Splitting has also been enacted physically: Germany is now ‘exporting’ – some call it ‘deporting’ – thousands of old and sick Germans to retirement and rehabilitation centres in Eastern Europe and Asia because it’s cheaper. This is ‘disowning’ old people literally.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see why it arises. Powerlessness is perhaps the hardest state for us to tolerate today. Our culture speaks approvingly (and often helpfully) about ‘empowerment’. In the process, though, we neglect the importance of learning to accept limitation and weakness, incapacity and dependency, yet no one can go their entire life without experiencing them.</p>
<p>The age deniers displace the painful losses and limitations that can come with chronic illness and disability from the third age onto the fourth age, so that they can safely be ignored for longer. But piling all vulnerability into the last years makes ageing much more frightening. Old people ‘carry’ a burden for the not-yet-old – all fragility is invested in them so that the rest of us don’t need to feel it. And yet they are the ones who are made to feel burdensome.</p>
<p>Interdependent</p>
<p>But a growing number of thinkers have found a much more radical and exciting way of thinking about vulnerability: they’re challenging our conventional understandings of the meaning of dependency. American activist Barbara Macdonald was one of the first to reexamine her own assumptions about physical strength and weakness. It started on a march in New England in 1978 when she was 65. One of the marshals tasked with keeping the march moving, seeing Macdonald’s grey hair and wrinkles, told her that if she couldn’t keep up she should move to another part of the line. At first Macdonald was shocked and upset. Then, though, she struggled with herself, reasoning that there was nothing wrong with being physically weak: ‘If it does not happen to be true of me now, it will be true of me soon. If I have pride in my strength now, it is false pride and … I [will] feel shame in my lack of strength later.’</p>
<p>The Gray Panthers went further, rejecting the false opposition between independence and dependence, and championing the idea of interdependence instead. As Maggie Kuhn explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We say that we cannot be human all by ourselves; we need each other. I have arthritis and I have failing vision and the two conditions … complicate my life … I say to people: ‘Help me, may I take your hand up this step or down this kerb.’ I have learnt not to feel diminished by asking for help. Instead, I feel a new kind of reward from human love: I touch your arm and something happens, something that is warming and affirming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people are better at this than others. Psychotherapist Marie de Hennezel has observed many older people entrusting their body to other people’s care with grace, and without embarrassment or humiliation. It’s as if they help their carers look after them.</p>
<p>Most recently, American anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson has urged us to see both giving and taking as part of a single pattern and not as alternatives. In America, she argues, there’s so much stigma attached to needing help that it’s easy to despise those who do. But when economists talk of ‘dependency ratios’ – of young people working to support older people – they’re obscuring the real reciprocity on which all human relationships depend. Because of course there’s exchange in each direction in every human activity. Doesn’t the doctor need their patients, and learn from them? And surely the comedian depends on the audience?</p>
<p>So how does this help us deal with our fears about growing older? Taking back our anxieties about the precariousness and vulnerability that are part of the human condition but which we’ve offloaded onto elderly people, and learning to tolerate dependence rather than locating all our fears about it in older people – what a kind gesture to make to our future ageing self! This frees us to reimagine old people, and identify them not purely with death and disability but also with long life. It enables us to realize that growth and psychological development aren’t a property of our earliest years but can continue throughout the life cycle.</p>
<p>Losing and gaining</p>
<p>Among the other states that need to be cultivated in preparation for old age, as well as during it, are mourning and gratitude. Old age, says Erikson, is a time of relinquishing – friends, old roles, even possessions that belonged to earlier stages of life. Yet at every stage of life some attachments need to be given up for others to develop, in order to move forward. Such losses and endings are a kind of bereavement, and are bound to recur throughout our lives, especially at periods of greatest transition. We need to acknowledge and mourn them if they’re not to impede change. This is one of the ‘developmental tasks’ of ageing, at every age.</p>
<p>The Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci had a fall in Rome in his sixties; failed surgery left him unable to walk. He assumed that he’d never direct another film, but ‘everything changed the moment I accepted the situation.’ He realized that ‘he could be happy even here’, in his wheelchair. His most recent film was released in 2013, when he was 73.</p>
<p>Mourning creates a space in which a sense of gratitude can develop – gratitude for what remains, or for what unfolds in place of what’s been lost. This ability to be thankful, about small things as well as major ones, has to be cultivated if it doesn’t come naturally. We may mock those forever praising ‘a nice cup of tea’, or who, when they go to bed at night, look back on their day in search of things to be grateful about. It may feel a little mechanical but, if practised regularly, learning to appreciate small gestures, tiny pieces of good fortune and, equally, the lack of bad things becomes a very valuable habit indeed.</p>
<p>The indomitable playwright and analyst Florida Scott-Maxwell had this habit in abundance. Her unvarnished account of being old, The Measure of My Days, is full of rage, passion and insight. Infirmity is there, certainly, but it isn’t the pivot of her existence. And the absence of pain becomes a cause for elation: ‘This morning when I woke and knew that I had had a fair night, that my pains were not too bad, I lay waiting for the uplifting moment when I pull back the curtains, see the sky, and I surprised myself by saying out loud: “My dear, dear days.”’</p>
<p>The radical old</p>
<p>In English ‘old’ is the opposite of ‘young’ but also of ‘new’. This identifies elderly people with everything that’s conservative. What a calumny!</p>
<p>Maggie Kuhn saw older people in precisely the opposite way. In the vanguard of social change, they’re society’s futurists – testing out new instruments, technologies, ideas and styles of living. Older people, she insisted, were ideally placed to be watchdogs of public bodies, guardians of the public interest and common good, advocates of consumers’ rights, whistle-blowers and monitors of corporate power. They weren’t just custodians of the past but also trustees of the future. This is a very different image from that of the disengaged, withdrawn individual that we’re usually presented with whenever old age is depicted.</p>
<p>‘Why should I care about posterity?’ Groucho Marx famously quipped. ‘What’s posterity ever done for me?’ But older people are increasingly busying themselves with posterity, wanting to leave behind a more sustainable planet. And of course they’re particularly well placed for this task: because they remember what delayed gratification feels like, and their experience has taught them that life can be comfortable and entertaining without excessive consumption. Those who lived through the Second World War also remember how to make Mock Plum Pudding or Imitation Eggs, and will never forget the taste of a banana when it was a rare, prized jewel.</p>
<p>If we’re prepared to look at age without prejudice we may be heartened by what we find. We routinely hear about old people as recipients of care; what gets passed over is that they’re also massive providers of it. According to the National Citizenship Survey, 30 per cent of 65- to 74-years-olds volunteer regularly, as do one-fifth of people 75 and over. Volunteering bridges the divide between old people receiving welfare and dispensing it: it enables them to tackle other people’s social exclusion or isolation at the same time as their own. What’s particularly exciting is a growing recognition among voluntary organizations that even frail older people and those with significant disabilities can, with enough flexibility, be recruited and retained as volunteers.</p>
<p>Older people’s reduced energy seems to be more than compensated for by the increased amount of time they have available. A report by the think tank ResPublica in 2011 found that, when it came to civil activism – acting as local councillors, school governors or magistrates – people over 75 were as active as 26- to 34-year-olds. One reason that old people give for volunteering is personal growth – yes, even at 90. Ageing like this doesn’t seem quite so bad.</p>
<p>The fear of dementia</p>
<p>Until, that is, you notice Alzheimer’s lurking in the shadows, waiting to derail any optimistic discussion. Dementia seems to have become the emblem of old age, even though it isn’t caused by ageing, and isn’t an inevitable part of the ageing process. At its worst, its effects are devastating. Yet the myths – that it obliterates all memory, and that people with Alzheimer’s can’t learn anything new – erase not only the past of people with dementia but also their future. In fact, though their cognitive and complex memories are compromised, their bodily, emotional, skill and artistic memories are often still intact and acute.</p>
<p>Many different exciting new projects are now stimulating these other faculties. Like Artists for Alzheimer’s, through which artists share their work with people with dementia. They also organize tours of museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Louvre in Paris: here people with dementia show not only a remarkable sensitivity to the work of others but also do powerful creative work themselves.</p>
<p>In Music for Life’s interactive music workshops in care homes and day centres, professional musicians improvise alongside people with dementia. Other projects have created books of startling poems out of the conversations of people with dementia: they speak in metaphors, a highly lyrical language of elation, wit and despair. Projects like York Dementia Without Walls are developing the concept of dementia-friendly cities, on the grounds that what’s good for people with dementia is good for everybody. Extraordinarily, there’s even evidence that psychoanalysis can help develop some peace of mind in both people with dementia and those looking after them.</p>
<p>What these projects also do is bring people of all ages and life stages together, and remind us of our shared humanity – and fragility.</p>
<p>Ageing contentedly</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s affects large numbers, but they’re still a minority of old people. The majority of older people without brain disease maintain a sense of reasonable well-being until just before they die, according to three major American studies. They’re also less depressed than the general population, and most aren’t incapacitated by illness. Instead, the Harvard Study of Adult Development found the majority constantly reinvent their lives and don’t lose sight of why they wanted to keep on living. Even if they fall ill, their reaction to their condition is more important than their objective state of health.</p>
<p>Ageing inevitably brings losses and usually some physical deterioration, but those who remain engaged with life manage to maintain a positive ratio of enthusiasm to resignation. The ones who fare best not only care about what they leave behind for the next generation, but are also able to keep learning from people both older and younger than themselves.</p>
<p>This isn’t old age as we’ve been taught to fear it. It’s more like W. B. Yeats’s characterization of it in ‘Sailing to Byzantium’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An aged man is but a paltry thing,</p>
<p>A tattered coat upon a stick, unless</p>
<p>Soul clap its hands and sing …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we encourage our soul to sing? Perhaps by realizing that souls need nurturing at every age, and that we need to begin the process long before we reach old age. If we can draw sustenance from these alternative views of ageing while also directly facing our anxieties, if we’re able to give ourselves permission to grow older but at the same time resist the myths about ageing, then the gift we receive in return is invaluable: the ability to position ourselves in a whole lifespan, and see the integrity of a human life, however long or short it might be.</p>
<p>Those who urge us to fight ageing are, in effect, inviting us to stop growing and developing. In so doing, they’re depriving us of the opportunity to carry out and successfully complete the task of being alive and human. Individually and collectively we’re being infantilized: we should insist on the right to grow up.</p>
<p>Growing older, many believe, can be taught. Certainly we have to teach children that they won’t always be young: education and debate can encourage them to imagine themselves at each stage in the life cycle – neither decrepit nor omnipotent. This in itself will help foster a sense of identification with people of every age, older ones included. Some of the ways that this can be done haven’t yet been dreamed up, but as more and more people anticipate longevity and engage with the life cycle – prospectively and not only retrospectively – all sorts of innovative projects and communities will emerge to help us sustain Erikson’s ‘vital engagement’ throughout the lifespan, and not just in the earliest stages.</p>
<p>And maybe someone will design a photo booth that allows children to project themselves forward into fully rounded, witty, attractive and contented people – at every age.</p>
