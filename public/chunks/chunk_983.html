        <h2>WHY DID WE PICK THEM?</h2>
<p>They were perhaps, in the end, not really the right person to pick. As we can see now, they came with a host of problematic points that we would have been wise to steer clear of. But, at the same time, we should graciously accept that we didn’t stumble into error by chance. We made a mistake because we often feel actively drawn to the wrong people. The standard view is that we seek happiness in love, but what it seems we actually seek is familiarity – which may well complicate any plans we might have for happiness, for we are not always familiar with what is good for us.</p>
<p>We may unconsciously long to recreate in our adult relationships some of the feelings we knew in childhood. It was as children that we first came to know and understand what love meant. But unfortunately, the lessons we picked up may not have been straightforward. The love we knew then may have come entwined with more than just kindness. It may have been coupled with a feeling of being controlled or humiliated, being abandoned, never communicating – in short, with suffering.</p>
<p>As adults, we may then reject potential partners, not because they are wrong, but because they are too well balanced (too mature, too understanding, too reliable), and their rightness feels unfamiliar and somehow oppressive. We may call these kind people ‘boring’ or ‘unsexy’ and instead head towards people who our unconscious senses will frustrate us in familiar ways. We make mistakes because, deep down, we don’t ultimately associate being loved with feeling entirely satisfied.</p>
<p>Knowing that we don’t choose our partners freely (from a psychological point of view) can help to dampen our annoyance with those we end up with and who hurt us badly. We weren’t merely stupid, we were constrained by our childhood history of love.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the more we understand why certain problematic candidates felt attractive, the more we can free ourselves from their appeal. As we start to grasp how our childhoods gave us unhelpful templates for love, we can free ourselves from their influence and learn to choose partners who can more properly satisfy our adult hopes for happiness and fulfilment.</p>
