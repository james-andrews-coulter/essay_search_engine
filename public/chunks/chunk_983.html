        <h2>1. How to Build a Home</h2>
<p>What is the very first home you can remember?</p>
<p>Look back and remember. When can you remember it from – how old were you? What did it feel like? Where was it? How big was it? How many rooms did it have? And how were they arranged? Look
  around the home you have made today. Does it contain anything – any furniture, any objects, or even a sense of atmosphere from that first home? Write down everything you can recall about your
  first home, and, if you can, try to draw it.</p>
<p>Now return to the present. Does that home still exist? Have you seen it? What is it like now? Who lives there now? What have they done to it? Do you know? Has it influenced the way you make your
  home now?</p>
