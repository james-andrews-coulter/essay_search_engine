            <h2>EVERYTHING IS TRANSIENT</h2>
<p>Chomei opens his book with a metaphor comparing human life to a river: “On flows the river ceaselessly, nor does the water ever stay the same. The bubbles that float upon its pools now disappear, now form anew, but never endure long. And so it is with people in this world, and with their dwellings.” He’s reminding himself—and us—of the half-terrifying, half-consoling fact that our existence and all our pleasures and troubles are fleeting.</p>
<p>Because our lives are so brief it is the quality of our experiences, rather than the extent of our possessions, that matters. The more things we own, the more we are exposed to random misfortune: A fashionable home will soon be dated; our prestige in the eyes of others will fluctuate for trivial reasons; we might build a palace and die before it is completed; and the monuments we hope will allow our names to last get misinterpreted or torn down. The simple hut makes an accommodation with impermanence: It might get blown down in a storm or washed away in a flood, officials might arrive at our door and tell us we have to leave, but our needs have been pared down so much that chance has less to work on.</p>
<p>“WORLDLY” PEOPLE ARE LESS HAPPY THAN THEY SEEM</p>
<p>A thought that erodes our willingness to live a simpler life—in a hut, if need be—is the haunting fear that other people are having a wonderful time. Perhaps we could manage to get by, but we’d always be conscious of how much we were missing out on.</p>
<p>Chomei continually reminded himself that a “worldly” life—which in his early and middle years he knew intimately—carries a heavy load of limitations, defects, and sorrows. The life of the well-to-do is less enviable than it outwardly seems. The fashionable world is full of what he called “cringing”: “You worry over your least action; you cannot be authentic in your grief or your joy.” In high society, it is always paramount to consider how any opinion will be judged by the other members of the social beehive. Envy is widespread and there is perpetual anxiety around losing status—which takes the satisfaction out of prosperity: “without a peaceful mind, palaces and fine houses mean nothing.”</p>
<p>Chomei’s aim wasn’t to disparage the rich. “I am simply comparing my past, worldly life with my present one,” he wrote, and added that the balance of pleasures and contentment was distinctly in favor of the latter. What he had been denied wasn’t, on examination, worth regretting.</p>
<p>Chomei is showing us that it’s possible to live in materially minimal conditions while being good-humored, ambitious, and in search of true fulfillment. He is dismantling our fear that material modesty has to mean degradation and squalor. We can, if we embrace his ideas, live more simply anywhere, including a hut, should we have to. And in the meantime, as we now know, we do not need to be so afraid.</p>
<p>3 Become an Aristocrat</p>
<p>Aristocrats are, of course, a faintly ridiculous proposition: They wear tweedy clothes; they speak with improbable accents; they have odd-sounding, often very long names; they bury themselves in the depths of the country on estates that have been in their families for generations, devoting themselves to the slaughter of foxes and grouse; they are low on talent and ill-equipped for competition in a meritocratic society.</p>
<p>But they have one very enviable merit: They are utterly indifferent to popular opinion. It never occurs to them to worry whether what they care about will get a fair hearing in the media. They accept that they belong to a radical minority and it would be absurd to imagine that the average person would know about, let alone be sympathetic to, their world. This gives them the strength to approach the media with light-hearted indifference. They don’t blame or even dislike the popular press for not understanding them—it’s entirely inevitable. The vast majority of the population are, in their eyes, simply unfortunate people who at some level mean well but can’t conceivably have opinions worth taking too seriously. Aristocrats are not politically anti-democratic but something quite different and more intriguing: They are psychologically above popular opinion.</p>
<p>We might rather wish we could share some of their unconcern, but how can we who lack castles and long lines of fancy ancestors possibly have access to this elevated and blithe state of mind?</p>
<p>The dilemma received one intriguing answer in France in the nineteenth century. Traditionally, aristocrats had been defined by their huge economic and political power. But in the Revolution of 1789, many of them lost their heads and even more lost their money, so a new definition started to be explored. A pivotal figure in this was the novelist and essayist Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, who was born in 1808 into the Normandy gentry. His family had for generations been allied with the grand lords who ruled the nation. They had now lost their lands and their homes, but they still wished to signal that they were not like everyone else. Barbey d’Aurevilly tried to give form to a sense of superiority that did not depend on lineage or money: He might no longer have been at the top of society in sheer material terms but he possessed—so he thought—a different and more important title. He was one of the initiators of a new idea of aristocracy: an aristocracy of the spirit rather than the blood. To be an aristocrat in the modern world, he suggested, was a matter of possessing elegant taste, sensibility, lofty ideas, and refined emotions. This, rather than the possession of large tracts of land and a chateau or two, was what gave one the keys to the elite.</p>
<p>In his own life, Barbey d’Aurevilly expressed his attitude by adopting an extravagant mode of dress and self-presentation. He was very fond of lace cuffs and often wore an elaborate cravat; he grew a vast mustache, adopted a haughty posture, and perfected a way of lifting his chin, lowering his eyelids and gazing down his nose to convey a profound lack of concern for what people in general might think of him, or indeed of anything else. It wasn’t his bloodline that he thought set him apart, it was his soul. He resolutely opposed the notion of popularity. The ideal, he said, was “to be a genius and to be obscure,” although he was in fact rather widely read in his own time. Loftiness and intensity of mind did not need popular endorsement.</p>
<p>Barbey d’Aurevilly was putting a finger on a crucial possibility: that there might be a modern, workable version of a legitimate aristocratic disdain for public opinion. It could be reasonable to see oneself as being “above” the populist debate, without possessing an estate or an ancient name, just because one had a different sort of mind.</p>
<p>Sadly, Barbey d’Aurevilly was too emotionally attached to the vision of looking special to fully articulate the deeper implications of his thought. In reality, a pure aristocrat of the spirit could look entirely normal, live in a perfectly ordinary house and have a common enough job and never sport a cravat. None of the dandyish garb of nineteenth-century aristocrats of the spirit was really necessary. What should in essence set aristocrats of the spirit apart is a commitment to mental refinement.</p>
<p>Émile Lévy, Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, 1881.</p>
<p>Their disdain for popular opinion isn’t the result of ill will or hostility. It arises from a sober and careful analysis of the human condition. Most people just aren’t interested in understanding an opposed opinion; blind partisanship is simply far more tempting. It may be unfortunate that almost no one has a taste for unpicking the exact logic of an argument, but nothing in history should lead us to expect that they would. It’s surely a pity that millions are more eager to denounce than to explain, but it’s hardly surprising. A love of accurate explanation is almost as rare as the ownership of a castle.</p>
<p>The pure aristocrat of the spirit ignores public opinion not because they hate people but because they know them well and are sympathetic and compassionate toward the reasons why they won’t be thinking straight. They feel an immense tenderness toward the ordinary preoccupations and struggles of daily life that make intricate argumentation, tenderness, open-mindedness, and the delicate weighing of possibilities unreachable luxuries for most. They are set apart not by haughty contempt but by a melancholic certainty that the disputes of the populace will be chaotic, brutal, partisan, deeply illogical, and unfair because this is the normal, unfortunate lot of the human animal. These aristocrats don’t take any of it to heart. They never hoped to be widely understood or popularly appreciated.</p>
<p>Just as the aristocrat of the blood once did, the new aristocrat of the spirit takes pride in their genealogy. But they are no longer talking about DNA. They belong to the great dynastic family of everyone who has shared their sensitivity, their suffering, and their nobility of mind. They discover that Stendhal was an ancestor and Rembrandt was a member of their clan; Jane Austen perhaps was a relative and possibly Leo Tolstoy. They are, with great legitimacy, laying claim to a different but entirely real kind of nobility: one of ideas, responses, emotions, doubts, worries, pleasures, aspirations, and complications, the common heritage of a small, but very lovely lineage. And so they—we—can look on the disorders of democratic debate in the mass media without anxiety or distress. For we inhabit a very different kind of castle: one made of sensitivity rather than stone, just as enduring and open to all free-thinking newcomers, though invisible to the eyes of most.</p>
<p>4 The Ecstatic Dance</p>
<p>One of the strangest but also most intriguing and redemptive things that humans get up to, in almost any culture one cares to study, is occasionally to gather in large groups, bathe in the rhythmic sounds of drums and flutes, organs and guitars, chants and cries, and move their arms and legs about in complicated and frenzied ways, losing themselves in the bewilderment of a dance.</p>
<p>Dancing has a claim to be considered among the most essential and salutary activities we ever partake in. Not for nothing did Nietzsche, a painfully inhibited figure in day-to-day life, declare, “I would believe only in a God who could dance”—a comment that stands beside his equally apodictic pronouncement: “Without music, life would be a mistake.”</p>
<p>But dancing is at the same time an activity that many of us, arguably those of us who might most need to do it, are powerfully inclined to resist and deep down to fear. We stand on the side of the dance floor appalled at the possibility of being called to join in, attempt to make our excuses the moment the music begins, and take pains that no one will ever, ever see our hips unite with a beat.</p>
<p>The point here is definitely not to learn to dance like an expert but to remember that dancing badly is something we might actually want to do and, equally importantly, something that we already know how to do—at least to the appalling level that is the only proficiency we need to derive key benefits.</p>
<p>In almost all cultures and at all points of history—except oddly enough perhaps our own—dancing has been widely and publicly understood as a form of bodily exercise with something very important to contribute to our mental state. Dancing has nothing to do with dancing well, being young, or revealing one’s stylishness. Summed up sharply, we might put it like this: Dancing has been valued for allowing us to transcend our individuality and for inducing us to merge into a larger, more welcoming, and more redemptive whole.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that one of the main gods of Hinduism was a dancing god and that Shiva’s dance has a meaning with resonance far beyond a specific religion. By dancing, we may enter, as Shiva does, back into harmony with the cosmos. As limbs swing and bodies sway, the many details of our material and practical lives—our age, levels of prosperity, voting preferences, even our gender—drop away and we reunite with the totality.</p>
<p>Shiva as the Lord of Dance, Tamil Nadu, India, c. 950–1000.</p>
<p>A comparably rich vision of dancing developed in classical Greece. The Greeks were for the most part committed worshipers of the rational mind. One of their foremost gods, Apollo, was the embodiment of cool reason and disciplined wisdom. However, the Greeks understood—with prescience—that a life devoted only to the serenity of the mind could be at grave risk of desiccation and loneliness. And so they balanced their concern with Apollo with regular festivals in honor of a quite different god, Dionysus, a god that drank wine, stayed up late, loved music—and danced.</p>
<p>The Greeks knew that the more rational we usually are, the more important it is—at points—to fling ourselves around to the wild rhythms of pipes and drums. At the festivals of Dionysus, held in Athens in March every year, even the most venerable and dignified members of the community would join in with unrestrained dancing that, irrigated by generous amounts of red wine, lasted until dawn.</p>
<p>A word often used to describe such dancing is “ecstatic.” It’s a telling term. Ecstatic comes from two Latin words, ex (meaning apart) and stasis (meaning standing), indicating a state in which we are symbolically “standing apart” from ourselves, separated from the dense, detailed, and self-centered layers of our identities which we normally focus on and obsess over and reconnected with something more primal and more necessary: our common human nature. We remember, through a period of ecstatic dancing, what it is like to belong, to be part of something larger than ourselves, to be indifferent to our own egos—to be reunited with humanity.</p>
<p>William Bouguereau, La Jeunesse de Bacchus, 1884.</p>
<p>This aspiration hasn’t entirely disappeared in modernity, but it’s been assigned to very particular settings: the disco and the rave. These places often point us in unhelpful directions: toward being cool, a certain age, and knowledgeable about very stylish kinds of clothes and sounds—criteria that leave many of us out. We need urgently to recover a sense of the universal benefit of dancing. The greatest enemy of this is fear, and in particular the fear—as we may put it—that we will look “like an idiot” in front of people whose opinion might matter. The way through this is not to be told that we will in fact be fine and, with a bit of effort, very far from idiotic. Quite the opposite: We should accept with good grace that the whole point of redemptive, consoling, cathartic communal dancing is a chance to look like total, thoroughgoing idiots, the bigger the better, in the company of hundreds of other equally and generously publicly idiotic fellow humans.</p>
<p>We spend a good deal of our time fearing, as if it were a momentous calamity that we did not even dare contemplate in daylight, that we might be idiots and holding back from a host of important aspirations and ambitions as a result. We should shake ourselves free from such inhibitions by loosening our hold on any remaining sense of dignity and by accepting frankly that we are by nature completely idiotic, great sacks of foolishness that cry in the night, bump into doors, fart in the bath, and kiss people’s noses by mistake–but that far from being shameful and isolating, this idiocy is in fact a basic feature of our nature that unites us immediately with everyone else on the planet. We are idiots now, we were idiots then, and we will be idiots again in the future. There is no other option for a human.</p>
<p>Dancing provides us with a primordial occasion on which this basic idiocy can be publicly displayed and communally celebrated. On a dance floor filled with comparable idiots, we can at last delight in our joint foolishness. We can throw off our customary shyness and reserve and fully embrace our dazzling strangeness and derangement. An hour of frantic jigging should decisively shake us from any enduring belief in our normalcy or seriousness. We will no longer be able to bully others, persuade them of our superiority, humiliate them for their mistakes, or pontificate at length on weighty matters. We will no longer worry about how others see us or regret a few things we said to intimidating strangers. The gentle aches in our limbs and our memories of our moves will remind us of anchoring facts that will guarantee our ongoing sanity and kindness.</p>
<p>Whenever we have the chance to invite others around, especially very serious people by whom we’re intimidated or whom we might be seeking to impress, we should remember the divine Dionysus and dare, with his wisdom in mind, to put on “Dancing Queen,” “I’m So Excited” or “We are Family.” Knowing that we have Nietzsche on our side, we should let rip with a playlist that includes “What a Feeling,” “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” and “It’s Raining Men.” We should lose command of our normal rational pilot selves, abandon our arms to the harmonies, throw away our belief in a “right” way to dance or indeed to live, build the intensity of our movements to a frenzy, gyrate our heads to empty them of their absurd worries, forget our jobs, qualifications, status, achievements, plans, hopes, and fears—and merge with the universe or at least its more immediate representatives, our fellow new mad friends, before whom the disclosure of idiocy will be total.</p>
<p>Around us might be a formally shy accountant, an efficient dental nurse, or a white-haired school principal bending up and down and flinging their arms in the air, throwing their heads back, contorting their bodies. After a few songs, something astonishing will begin to happen: It won’t matter any more that we said a slightly out of place thing in a meeting two weeks ago, that we haven’t yet met the love of our life, or that we still don’t understand very much at all. We will feel a part of something far more important than ourselves, a supportive community in which our individual errors and doubts will cease to weigh so heavily and punishingly upon us.</p>
<p>Through dance, we glimpse a huge project: how we might more regularly experience ourselves as vulnerable in front of other people in order to become better friends to ourselves and more generous and compassionate companions to others. The true potential of dancing has for too long been abandoned by thoughtful people to stylish elites who have forgotten the elemental seriousness of allowing themselves to be and look idiotic. We should reclaim the ecstatic dance and uninhibited boogie-woogie for their deepest universal purposes: to reconnect, reassure, and reunite us.</p>
<p>5 Learning to be Angry</p>
<p>There are many reasons to believe that one of the dominant problems in the world today is an excess of anger. We know all about the very shouty and their antics: their tantrums, their lack of reason, their unwillingness to compromise. Furthermore, it threatens to get a lot worse because we seem to be locked into a set of dynamics—political, technological, environmental—which promise an ever less patient, ever less serene, and ever less forgiving future.</p>
<p>But it may be rather more realistic, albeit odd-sounding, to insist on the very opposite: that whatever the impression generated by a publicly vocal angry cohort, the far more common yet, by nature, invisible problem is a contrary tendency: a widespread inability to get angry, a failure to know how rightly and effectively to mount a complaint, an inarticulate swallowing of frustration and the bitterness, the subterranean “acting out” and the low-level depression that follow from not allowing any of our rightful sorrows to find expression. For every person who shouts too loudly, there are at least twenty who have unfairly lost their voice.</p>
<p>We are not talking here of delirious rage, the sort that injures innocents and leads nowhere. The point isn’t to rehabilitate barbarism but to make the case for a capacity to speak up, with dignity and poise, in order to correct a reasoned sense that something isn’t right—and that those around us need to take our opposing perspective on board.</p>
<p>We are as a rule hopeless at being angry, from the very nicest of motives: in part, from a belief in the complexity of situations and the minds of other people, which undercuts enthusiasm for anything that smacks of self-righteousness or pride. We tell ourselves, in relationships or at work, that others must have good reasons for behaving as they do, that they must be essentially kind and good and that it would be an insult to their efforts to raise our hand about a problem that we surely don’t even entirely understand.</p>
<p>We tend to import our modesty from childhood. It’s a privilege to allow a child to manifest their frustration and not all parents are game. Some are very keen on having a “good baby.” They let the infant know from the first that being “naughty” isn’t funny and that this isn’t a family where children are allowed to “run rings around” the adults. Difficult moods and tantrums, complaints and rages are not to be part of the story. This certainly ensures short-term compliance, but paradoxically, preternaturally good behavior is usually a precursor of bad feelings, and in extremes of mental unwellness, in adulthood. Feeling loved enough that one can flip off parental figures and occasionally fling something—soft—across the room belongs to health; truly mature parents have rules and allow their children sometimes to break them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is a species of inner deadness that comes from having had to be too good too soon and to resign one’s point of view without a flicker of self-defense. In relationships, this might mean a tendency to get taken royally for a ride for many years, not in terms of outright abuse—though that too—but of the kind of low-level humiliation which seems the lot of people who can’t make a fuss. At work, an unwavering concern for politeness, empathy, and gentleness may end up providing the perfect preconditions for being walked all over.</p>
<p>We need to relearn the neglected art of politely, on necessary occasions, being a pain. The danger of those who have never shouted is that they might, in compensation, end up screaming. That isn’t the point either. The goal is a firm but self-possessed protest: Excuse me, but you are ruining what’s left of my life. I’m so sorry, but you are cauterizing my chances of happiness. I beg your pardon, but this is enough . . .</p>
<p>We think a lot about going on vacation and trying new activities. There’s plenty of enthusiasm for learning other languages and attempting foreign dishes. But true exoticism and adventure may lie closer to home: in the emotional sphere, and in the courage and originality required to give contained anger a go, perhaps tonight, after supper. We have the speeches written in our heads already. There is likely to be a spouse, a parent, a colleague, or a child who hasn’t heard enough from us for far too long—and with whom it would be of incalculable benefit to our heart rate and our emotional and physical constitution to have a word. The timid always imagine that anger might destroy everything good. They overlook, because their childhoods encouraged them to, that anger can also be a fertilizer from which something a lot less bitter and a lot more alive can emerge.</p>
<p>6 Hugo’s Defiance</p>
<p>There have been few writers as brave as Victor Hugo. Over a turbulent sixty-year career, he fought fiercely for what he believed in: republican government, medieval architecture, an end to capital punishment, school and prison reform, a United States of Europe, and the right to lead the kind of complicated private life that upsets prudes. We shouldn’t allow his posthumous acclaim to disguise how much he was, in certain quarters, loathed in his lifetime.</p>
<p>And yet, as his portrait suggests, he knew full well how to face critics down. In 1845, Hugo’s friend the academic and politician Abel François Villemain fell into despair because of rumors about his sexuality and attacks on his work by professional enemies. Only concern for his daughters prevented Villemain from killing himself. Fortunately, Hugo was both a good friend and a great consoler, and came over one evening to shake him from his sorrow:</p>
<p>You have enemies! Well who doesn’t have them? Guizot has enemies, Thiers has enemies, Lamartine has enemies. Haven’t I myself been fighting for twenty years? Haven’t I spent twenty years being hated, sold down the river, betrayed, reviled, taunted and insulted? Have my books not been ridiculed and my actions travestied? I’ve had traps set for me; I’ve even fallen into a few . . . What do I care? I have contempt. It’s one of the hardest but also most necessary things in life to learn to have contempt. Contempt protects and crushes. It’s like a breast plate and an axe. Do you have enemies? That’s simply the fate of anyone who has done anything worthwhile or launched any new idea. It’s a necessary fog that clings to anything that shines. Fame must have enemies, as light must have gnats. Don’t worry about it; just have contempt. Keep your spirit serene and your life lucid. Never give your enemies the satisfaction of thinking that they’ve been able to cause you grief or pain. Stay happy, cheerful, contemptuous and firm.</p>
<p>People-pleasing carries grave risks, as Hugo knew only too well, and it’s well-targeted contempt that can save our spirits.</p>
<p>Étienne Carjat, Victor Hugo, 1876.</p>
<p>7 Learning to Lay Down Boundaries</p>
<p>One of the reasons why our lives might be less sane than they should be is that we have missed out on an awkward-sounding but critical art whose absence we may until now never even have noticed: that of laying down boundaries.</p>
<p>Laying down a boundary involves informing those around us—colleagues, parents, children, lovers—of a given set of objectively reasonable things that we are going to require in order to feel respected and happy, while doing so in a way that conveys confidence, self-possession, warmth, and a mixture of kindness and strength.</p>
<p>Those who can successfully lay down boundaries will tell their small child that though they love them very much, once this game is over, Mommy or Daddy is not going to want to play another round and it will be time to go upstairs for hair-washing and there’s simply no other way, darling chipmunk, however disappointing I know this will sound, and biting or kicking is not the answer, as we’ve discussed before. The good boundary-builder will wait until everyone is well rested to tell their partner that though they love them to take the initiative in a hundred areas, when it comes to their own family, they want to be left in charge—and therefore it wasn’t right for the partner to call up their mother-in-law without warning in order to arrange the forthcoming holidays. And at work, the boundaried manager will tell their new hire that though they want to be supportive where possible, it simply isn’t their role to complete schedules or manage budgets for others.</p>
<p>However, because most of us have not been educated in this byway of emotional maturity, the boundaries are either non-existent or else established in a random or destructive manner. As the technical language has it, we are either too compliant or too rigid. Mommy or Daddy might not, therefore, ever say they’ve had enough of the game and, even when wilting, play on late into the night, ensuring that chipmunk will be exhausted and cross the next day, as well as craving the security that comes from knowing that their grown-up is “grown up” enough to say no, even to what they ostensibly badly want—if there’s one thing we crave more than that our wishes are granted, it’s someone responsible enough to resist granting them all. In a relationship, we might never explain what we require in order to feel content and therefore either store up our resentments—and, usually, therefore grow unable to have sex—or else burst into unexplained rages that exhaust our partner’s capacity for love. At work, meanwhile, we might develop a reputation as a friendly pushover or as an unreasonable tyrant whom it becomes a lot of fun to try to evade.</p>
<p>Those who can’t lay down boundaries have invariably not, in their early lives, had their own boundaries respected. Someone didn’t allow them to say when they were unhappy with a genuinely difficult situation; someone didn’t give much of a damn about their hurt feelings or distinctive hopes; someone insinuated that being good meant falling in line, always, immediately. No one modeled the skill of winning, graceful objection. And so now, when the time comes to make a request of others, three powerful anxieties bedevil the boundary-less person:</p>
<p>if I speak up, they will hate me</p>
<p>if I speak up, I will become a target for retribution</p>
<p>if I speak up, I will feel like a horrible person</p>
<p>Though such fears manifest themselves as unquestionable certainties, they are amenable to gentle probing. People almost never hate those who make polite and reasonably framed demands; in fact, they tend to respect and like them a little more. They feel in the presence of a maturity and kindly authoritativeness that appear worthy of their time, as well as seeming rare and a bit thrilling. Frustrating someone’s wishes doesn’t have to be evidence of selfishness; it may signal a noble concern for another’s long-term well-being and flourishing. We can adore someone, wish them the very best, have the kindest intentions toward them—and still, very diplomatically and yet very decisively, tell them no.</p>
<p>An alternative response to building boundaries is a habit of throwing up walls topped with razor wire ringed by machine-gun turrets, or, to put it more simply, a tendency to get swiftly and gratingly defensive. The manically defensive person is also laboring under a set of highly unfortunate misapprehensions:</p>
<p>that everyone is trying to hurt them badly</p>
<p>that no one will listen unless they hit back with immense force</p>
<p>that their needs cannot ever truly be met</p>
<p>Yet the alternative to lacking all boundaries is not violent defensiveness. We should not let boundary-building be undermined by its most zealous practitioners. There is always a means to make a sound case without reaching for a weapon.</p>
<p>It is notable that the problem of boundary-building is particularly acute not so much around strangers but in intimate life. We may well be able to fight our corner with people we care little about—the person at the car rental desk, the tax official; the problem comes when we are dealing with someone who loves us and whom we have allowed into our emotional inner sanctum. It is as if, in a deep part of our minds, we cannot reconcile the notion that someone might at once be genuinely caring and capable of betraying our best interests. We find it hard to be simultaneously intimate and always a touch vigilant. What should help us to absorb this eventuality is to remember that just as we can say no and still be kind, so another can have harmed us and yet remain, in their essence, good.</p>
<p>It takes a little self-confidence and courage to be able to notice just how bad we may be at the art of boundary-laying. We may have spent a large chunk of our lives already in an essentially passive relationship to everyday infringements by people close to us. But we aren’t a piece of helpless flotsam on the river of others’ wishes; we have agency, direction, and, as it were, a rudder. The price to pay for affection isn’t compliance. We can gradually take on board a highly implausible-sounding but redemptive notion: that we can prove lovable and worthy of respect and at the same time, when the occasion demands it—as it probably will a few times every day—utter a warm-sounding but definitive “no.”</p>
<p>8 You Could Finally Leave School</p>
<p>Technically, most of us leave school at eighteen—an event that tends to be vividly etched in the memory and surrounded by considerable ceremony and emotion. And yet rather oddly, despite appearances, many of us in fact don’t manage to leave school at that point at all. In a deep part of our minds, we may still be there, well into adulthood, not sitting in a classroom precisely but, in terms of how our minds work, as much stuck within the confines of a school-based world-view as if we were showing up for assembly every day—generating immense and unnecessary degrees of unhappiness and compromise for ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>What beliefs might be some of the hallmarks of an enduring school-like way of thinking:</p>
<p>First and foremost, those in authority know what they are doing and our task is to obey and jump through the hoops they set for us. We desire to please teachers and gain prizes, cups, and ribbons.</p>
<p>There is an implicit curriculum out there—an externally mandated map of what we need to do to succeed—and a wise person must dutifully subscribe to its demands.</p>
<p>Work should, when it’s going well, feel substantially irksome, dull, and somewhat pointless. Schools teach us to forget, or ignore, the clues offered to us by our own boredom. They teach us dangerous degrees of patience, subtly training us in intellectual masochism.</p>
<p>We’re doing it for someone else—an audience: our teachers and our parents, and their substitutes in adult life. Make us proud. You have to shine. We’ve given you so much. What matters is the performance, not any inner sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Authority figures are benign, wanting what is good for us and speaking on behalf of our long-term interests. We’ll look after you. If you follow our rules, you will thrive. We don’t think we could ever know better and we distrust our instincts.</p>
<p>Exams, and all their successors, are fundamentally accurate. Those who set them have worked out the ultimate test of our value and we are what we score.</p>
<p>Every school is, in addition, a miniature society, equipped with a strong sense of what values to revere and codes to follow. Bullies lurk, ready to mock and identify any departures from the norm. We can’t escape them because they are next to us in class every day. They will spot and persecute the weirdos; they can ruin our lives. We learn to cower and adjust our attitudes. Following the herd is paramount.</p>
<p>None of these ways of thinking require us to be sitting in a geography class. We might be in an office selling garden furniture to the Belgian market and yet still think like this. We might have children of our own and yet inside still think that there are exams to pass and cups to be won. What would it mean to break the mold? What would it mean finally to leave school?</p>
<p>To know some of the following:</p>
<p>There is no one way, no guarantee of a set path to fulfillment, laid out by authority figures. They don’t know because no one knows.</p>
<p>The safe path may be entirely dangerous to our flourishing.</p>
<p>Our boredom is a vital tool that tells us what is slowly killing us—and reminds us that time is monstrously short.</p>
<p>Authority is not by definition benign. The teachers and their substitutes have no real plan for us except in so far as it suits their own advancement. It might look as if they want our supreme good but in reality they want us to play their game for their own benefit. At the end, they have no proper prize to offer us.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what the bullies think. No one is normal. Dare to make enemies—indeed, we must do so as the price to pay for having developed a character and found something truly to believe in.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t be tough on ourselves for lingering so long. School is an immensely impressive system. We start there when we are not much bigger than a chair. For more than a decade, it’s all we know. It is the outside world and it is what those who love us most tell us we should respect. It speaks with great authority not just about itself, but about life in general. It is sold to us as a preparation for the whole of existence. But, of course, the main thing it does is to prepare us for yet more school. It is an education in how to thrive within its own profoundly peculiar rules, with only a tenuous connection to the world beyond.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, we might do a very strange-sounding thing. We might finally work up the courage to leave our inner school, be it at twenty-eight, thirty-five, or sixty-two, and enter the wider, boundless world we have been in flight from for too long.</p>
<p>9 Grand Libraries</p>
<p>The problem with libraries is that they can be so large, impressive, and filled with knowledge that they unwittingly embed in us an idea that everything worth registering, everything valuable and true, must lie “out there,” must already have been classified on a shelf with an index number to await our discovery the moment we cease to be so preoccupied with ourselves.</p>
<p>But what this modest, respectful, and quietly self-hating conclusion disguises is that each one of us is an unparalleled and superlative center of knowledge in and of ourselves. Our minds have more ideas stored in them than are to be found in the collective catalogues of the Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and the British Library in London. We have vaults filled with a greater number of moving and beautiful scenes than exist in all the world’s greatest museums put together. We are just failing to wander the stacks and galleries as often as we should; we are failing to notice what we have seen. So convinced are we that insights of worth lie beyond us, we have omitted to consult the treasury of thoughts and visions generated every hour by our endlessly brilliant, fatefully unexplored minds.</p>
<p>The American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked, “In every work of genius, we recognize our own rejected thoughts.” In other words, geniuses don’t have thoughts that are in the end so very different from our own; they have simply had the confidence to take them more seriously. Rather than imagining that their minds are only a pale shadow of the minds of infinitely greater thinkers who lived and died elsewhere long ago, they have been respectful enough of their existence to conceive that one or two properly valuable ideas might plausibly choose to alight in the familiar aviary of their own intelligences. Thinking is—in a way we generally refuse to imagine—a truly democratic activity.</p>
<p>We all have very similar and very able minds. Where geniuses differ is in their more confident inclinations to study them properly.</p>

<p>10 Learning to Listen to Your Boredom</p>
<p>One of the most striking characteristics of small children is their militant aversion to boredom. With ruthless determination, they embark on one occupation after another, shifting their focus whenever an even marginally more attractive prospect comes into view. An average morning might involve taking out eight board games from the cupboard, then, just as it seemed it might be time for Snakes and Ladders, experimenting with turning the couch into a ski slope, then trying to pull toy rabbit’s tail off, followed by exploring what happens to the chocolate chip cookies when you pound them with a hammer, before finally tipping up all the kitchen chairs and pretending they might be ships engaged in a sea battle.</p>
<p>What we call education is in large measure an attempt to bring order to this peripatetic chaos by teaching the child to ignore the welter of their own spontaneous enthusiasms and instead learn to sit with their boredom for a while in the name of getting something substantial done: listening to a lengthy speech about kindness by the head teacher without screaming, enduring a forty-five-minute maths lesson without getting up to dance, resisting the temptation to draw an imaginary world during an introductory French class. Becoming that most prized of things, a “good child,” means mastering the art of suppressing our own boredom in the name of growing up.</p>
<p>The rationale for this pedagogical move is both solid and noble: there is clearly a great deal to be gained from not running away the moment a new fancy enters the mind. Yet the problem isn’t that we’re generally blind to this logic but that we’re far too good at submitting to it. Most of us are fatefully too proficient at bearing our own boredom.</p>
<p>Along the way, we forget that boredom has many important things to teach us. It is, at its best, a confused, inarticulate but genuine signal from a deep part of our minds that something is very wrong. We may not quite know what, but the sensation of being bored frequently contains—especially for otherwise sensible adults—an apprehension of genuine danger. There are boring books that should in all fairness be tossed aside. There are boring people we should, in order not to wither inside, refuse to see. There are boring movies we should walk out of. And what should sharpen our courage to do so is an ongoing awareness that the fundamental currency of our lives is time, of which we are in desperately short supply, there being on average no more than 26,000 days or so in an entire existence on the planet.</p>
<p>Listening to our boredom will tug us back to our true concerns. We realize what our tastes in literature really are, what sort of entertainment we actually go in for, what properly enthuses us about other people. Boredom functions as the scalpel with which we can cut off all that is “dead” and extraneous about our lives. The courage to admit to our boredom allows us, gradually, to develop a personality. Boredom is the inarticulate voice of a fundamental idea: that something has been oversold to us and needs to be discounted.</p>
<p>It is telling that, as they grow older, many artists instinctively get better at listening to their boredom and produce greatly superior work as a result—what critics commonly refer to as a “late style,” marked by impatience, brevity, courage, and intensity: one thinks of Bach’s exceptional later choral works, the final short stories of Chekhov, or the sublime paper cut-outs of the dying Matisse. Poignantly, on a tour of a primary school an ageing Picasso once said, “At their age, I knew how to paint like Titian. It’s taken me a lifetime to remember a greater achievement: how to paint like a child.” What he meant was that it had taken him decades to shake off a compliant urge to paint “well” and “respectably” and to listen instead more closely to his own sense of fun—which is a serious business not to be confused with its lesser sibling, frivolity. Pushed by mortality into a new respect for his own centers of pleasure, Picasso had learned how to overcome every trace of the mannered approach of his youth in order to focus instead on the joy of decorating a canvas with the loose brushstrokes, exuberance, and bold colors well known to those natural artistic masters: five-year-old children.</p>
<p>When he was fourteen: Pablo Picasso, Academic Study, 1895.</p>
<p>When he was seventy-six—and had finally remembered to listen to his boredom: Pablo Picasso, The Pigeons, 1957.</p>
<p>We don’t have to be a towering figure of twentieth-century art for the point to apply. All of us need to learn to develop a “late style,” ideally as early on in our lives as possible: a way of being wherein we shake off the dead hand of habit and social fear and relearn to listen to what entertains us—and so can stand the best chance of properly pleasing others too. The results should apply not to works of art in a museum, but to aspects of our intimate lives: to the way we choose a career, host a dinner party, go on a vacation, have sex, tell an anecdote, or act around our friends. Here too lie multiple opportunities to cut to the chase, to say what really matters, and to express what we truly feel and want, while we yawn politely but defiantly at all that is slowly killing us.</p>
<p>11 Gessner’s Hedgehog</p>
<p>Early in his career, the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner formulated an enviably ambitious plan: He would spend the rest of his life tracking down and describing every animal on the planet, from the armadillo to the green chameleon, the Egyptian mongoose to the rhinoceros. His labors resulted in one of the first and most beautiful works of zoology, Historia animalium, published in Zurich between 1551 and 1558.</p>
<p>Gessner got a lot of things wrong. He was muddled about names and numbers of legs. Many of his colors were off. He was confused about the numbers of stripes on the tiger and spots on the leopard. But it is Gessner’s boldness that continues to impress. He didn’t worry about the odd mistake, nor did he limit his aspirations for fear of treading on other experts’ toes.</p>
<p>He did have one enormous advantage, however: he was early on in the game. He did not have to suffer from the dispiriting sense, which too often subsumes us today, that everything must surely already be known; that there is nothing at all we might think that hasn’t already been better expressed somewhere else by someone else. The existence of so many books—130 million and rising—doesn’t so much inspire as crush us: What more could we possibly add? What thought worth having could ever germinate in our naive minds? The virgin snow across which Gessner once drove his intellectual sledge is now criss-crossed with others’ tracks. Increased knowledge has undermined our intellectual self-confidence.</p>
<p>But this cannot in truth be fair, for we still don’t understand so much: how to have good marriages, run countries, educate children, create beautiful architecture, or overcome loneliness—just to start the list. We have mapped less than one billionth of the real map of knowledge. We are almost as much at the beginning as Gessner was. Nothing should legitimately stop us from imagining that we couldn’t right now head out and, with a fair wind and a few years of toil, discover a menagerie of things at once unknown, colorful, and essential.</p>
<p>Conrad Gessner, Hedgehog, from Historia animalium, 1551.</p>
<p>12 How to Lengthen Your Life</p>
<p>The normal way we set about trying to extend our lives is by striving to add more years to them—usually by eating more couscous and broccoli, going to bed early, and running in the rain. But this approach may turn out to be quixotic, not only because Death can’t reliably be warded off with kale, but at a deeper level because the best way to lengthen a life is not by attempting to stick more years on to its tail.</p>
<p>One of the most basic facts about time is that, even though we insist on measuring it as if it were an objective unit, it doesn’t, in all conditions, seem to be moving at the same pace. Five minutes can feel like an hour; ten hours can feel like five minutes. A decade may pass like two years; two years may acquire the weight of half a century. And so on.</p>
<p>In other words, our subjective experience of time bears precious little relation to the way we like to measure it on a clock. Time moves more or less slowly according to the vagaries of the human mind: it may fly or it may drag; it may evaporate into airy nothing or achieve enduring density.</p>
<p>If the goal is to have a longer life, whatever the dieticians may urge, it would seem that the priority should be not to add raw increments of time but to ensure that whatever years remain feel appropriately substantial. The aim should be to densify time rather than to try to extract one or two more years from the grip of Death.</p>
<p>Why, then, does time have such different speeds, moving at certain points bewilderingly fast, at others with intricate moderation? The clue is to be found in childhood. The first ten years almost invariably feel longer than any other decade we have on earth. The teens are a little faster but still crawl. Yet by our forties, time will have started to trot; and by our sixties, it will be unfolding at a bewildering gallop.</p>
<p>The difference in pace is not mysterious but has to do with novelty. The more our days are filled with new, unpredictable, and challenging experiences, the longer they will feel. And, conversely, the more one day is exactly like another, the faster it will pass by in a blur. Childhood ends up feeling so long because it is the cauldron of novelty; because its most ordinary days are packed with extraordinary discoveries and sensations. These can be as apparently minor yet as significant as the first time we explore the zip on a cardigan or hold our nose under water, the first time we look at the sun through the cotton of a beach towel or dig our fingers into the putty holding a window in its frame. Dense as it is with stimuli, the first decade can feel a thousand years long.</p>
<p>By middle age, things can be counted upon to have grown a lot more familiar. We may have flown around the world a few times. We no longer get excited by the idea of eating a pineapple, owning a car, or flicking a light switch. We know about relationships, earning money, and telling others what to do. And as a result, time runs away from us without mercy.</p>
<p>One solution often suggested at this point is that we should put all our efforts into discovering fresh sources of novelty. We need to become explorers and adventurers. We must go to Machu Picchu or Angkor Wat, Astana or Montevideo; we need to find a way to swim with dolphins or order a thirteen-course meal at a world-famous restaurant in downtown Lima. That will finally slow down the cruel gallop of time.</p>
<p>But this is to labor under an unfair, expensive, and ultimately impractical notion of novelty: that it must involve seeing new things, when in fact it should really involve seeing familiar things with new eyes. We may by middle age certainly have seen a great many things in our neighborhoods, but we are—fortunately for us—unlikely to have properly noticed most of them. We have probably taken a few cursory glances at the miracles of existence that lie to hand and assumed, quite unjustly, that we know all there is to know about them. We’ve imagined we understand the city we live in, the people we interact with, and, more or less, the point of it all.</p>
<p>But of course we have barely scratched the surface. We have grown bored of a world we haven’t begun to study properly. And that, among other things, is why time is racing by.</p>
<p>The pioneers at making life feel longer in the way that counts are not dieticians but artists. At its best, art is a tool that reminds us of how little we have fathomed and noticed. It reintroduces us to ordinary things and reopens our eyes to a latent beauty and interest in precisely those areas we had ceased to bother with. It helps us to recover some of the manic sensitivity we had as newborns. Think of Cézanne looking closely at apples, as if he had never seen one before, and nudging us to do likewise.</p>
<p>Paul Cézanne, Apples, 1878–9.</p>
<p>We don’t need to make art in order to learn the most valuable lesson of artists, which is about noticing properly, living with our eyes open and thereby, along the way, savoring time. Without any intention to create something that could be put in a gallery, we could—as part of a goal of living more deliberately–take a walk in an unfamiliar part of town, ask an old friend about a side of their life we’d never dared probe, lie on our back in the garden and look up at the stars or hold our partner in a way we never tried before. It takes a rabid lack of imagination to think we have to go to Machu Picchu to find something new to perceive.</p>
<p>In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novel The Idiot, a prisoner has suddenly been condemned to death and been told he has only a few minutes left to live. “What if I were not to die!” he exclaims. “What if life were given back to me–what infinity! . . . I’d turn each minute into a whole age . . .” Faced with losing his life, the poor wretch recognizes that every minute could be turned into aeons of time, with sufficient imagination and appreciation.</p>
<p>It is sensible enough to try to live longer lives. But we are working with a false notion of what long really means. We might live to be a thousand years old and still complain that it had all rushed by too fast. We should be aiming to lead lives that feel long because we manage to imbue them with the right sort of open-hearted appreciation and unsnobbish receptivity, the kind that five-year-olds know naturally how to bring to bear. We need to pause and look at one another’s faces, study the sky, wonder at the eddies and colors of the river, and dare to ask the kinds of questions that open others’ souls. We don’t need to add years; we need to densify the time we have left by ensuring that every day is lived consciously—and we can do this via a maneuver as simple as it is momentous: by starting to notice all that we have as yet only seen.</p>
