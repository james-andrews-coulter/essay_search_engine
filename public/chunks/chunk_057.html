        <h2>Confession</h2>
<p>The missing god would allow us to confess to everything: the terrible words we had said, the awful things we had done … We wouldn’t need to carry secrets and guilt forever. We could utter them to the god, kneel down on the ground, make a sign of atonement – and then be relieved of our burdens. We could start afresh and be reborn under loving eyes. We could have a second chance.</p>
