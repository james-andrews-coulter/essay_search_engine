        <h1>6. The Crowded-Place Exercise (Feeling, Thinking, Acting)</h1>
<p>The Crowded Place Exercise helps us discover which ‘being zone’ is our most comfortable. To use ourselves optimally we need to be operational in three ‘being zones’: thinking; feeling; and taking action. Normally we are more comfortable in one or two of these zones. The Crowded Place Exercise may help us become aware of which zone we go to first, and remind us to use all three zones in order to maximize our inner resources.</p>
<p>To start with, do this exercise quickly, without rereading each part. You will need something to write with and your notepad (or write the answers on this book). Your answers do not need to be long. You are looking for first impressions here, not deliberations. (I have used the pronoun ‘I’ throughout the exercise – the ‘I’ is you and not me!)</p>

<ul>
<li>I am imagining I am in a crowded place. I am feeling</li>
<li>In this crowded place, I have my family and friends near me and I feel</li>
<li>The crowd surges forward and somehow I become separated from my group. I feel</li>
<li>I am surrounded by hundreds of people but I am on my own. I feel</li>

Now answer these questions:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking back over this visualization, did you see yourself as a child, one of the adults, or the person most in charge of the group?</p>
</li>
<li>Do you think it is important that you stick to the role you imagined for yourself?</li>
<li>How much difference was there between the feeling, thinking or doing answers? (If the answers were the same go back and do it again!)</li>
<li>Which came easiest to you, the feeling, thinking or doing answers?</li>
<li>How flexible or rigid are you about what responses you have? Do you see that you have a choice? Or is there no choice in how you respond?</li>
<li>Do you believe that your thinking influences your feeling and doing? Or does your feeling influence your thinking and doing? Or for you, is it doing that seems to come first followed by either feeling or thinking?</li>
<li>Which would you say was your most dominant zone of being: feeling, thinking or doing? And your least practised zone of being?</li>
<li>If you think about some of the other choices that affect how you act, think or feel, and imagine yourself doing them, how does that feel?</li>
<li>If you think of the days ahead, what choices do you have in how you think, feel and act? Patterns of behaving are habitual, but what is it like just to play in imagination about changing some of those patterns?</li>
<li>What would the pattern look like with one or two very minor changes?</li>
<li>What would major changes look like?</li>
<li>How many of your answers reflected pessimism?</li>
<li>
<p>How many of your answers reflected optimism?
iv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel your response to doing this exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>Think about your response to doing this exercise.</li>
<li>Did you do this exercise? Do you often miss out the ‘doing’ in your life? Is it a pattern?
This exercise may help us to become aware of which ‘being zone’ we go to first and remind us to use all three zones – thinking, feeling and taking action – in order to maximize our inner resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also use this exercise when working with couples or groups, to discover which zone each person is most comfortable in. When this is understood and communicated, people can better understand each other and improve their relationships. For example, I asked one couple I was working with to describe to me a typical argument between them. They told me they were expected at a friend’s house for the weekend. Their host had said, ‘Start out after breakfast and I’ll see you when I see you.’ The man assumed this meant everyone in the car by half past eight, ready to hit the road. The woman had assumed it meant she could give the kids some cereal in front of their cartoons while she leisurely packed, listening to her favourite Saturday-morning radio show. By nine o’clock, seeing the rest of the family still in their pyjamas, he started to raise his voice and she responded in kind.</p>
<p>The man was a ‘do-er’ and the woman was a ‘feel-er’, but they did not understand this, and found each other’s approach to this everyday situation incomprehensible. Doing the Crowded Place Exercise with each other, and learning that they each had a particular ‘being zone’ that was more developed than the other zones, helped them better understand each other and predict each other’s responses to situations. This allowed them to be more specific in what they each needed and to come to a compromise – not because one of them was right and the other wrong, but because they had come to respect that they were different and that each needed to consider the other accordingly.</p>
