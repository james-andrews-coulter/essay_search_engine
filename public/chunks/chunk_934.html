        <h3>6. The Rare vs The Everyday</h3>
<p>Romantics rebel against the ordinary. They are keen on the exotic and the rare. They like the thought that their relationship is special. They set particular store on doing unusual things. They don’t think much of routine in domestic life. They want heroism, excitement and an end to boredom. They don’t like the idea of money being an important factor in whether a relationship goes well or not.</p>
<p>The Classical personality welcomes routine as a defence against chaos. They are familiar enough with extremes as to welcome things that are a little boring. They can see the charm of doing the laundry. They embrace the thought that being in a relationship has a fair few things in common with running a small business.</p>
