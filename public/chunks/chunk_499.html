        <h3>Essential Ideas: Love</h3>
<p>From the new pocket book series, featuring key ideas from The School of Life exploring love.</p>
<p>The School of Life has distilled its most essential lessons on love in order to produce a pocket manual that is at once useful and entertaining. We learn – among other things – how to pick partners more reliably, how to avoid conflict and how to know whether a relationship is really for us.</p>
<p>We should cease to imagine that a satisfied love life is a chance event; with this book in hand, it emerges as something that we can all plot for and achieve.</p>
<p>Love is a skill, not an emotion; this is a guide to how we might master it.</p>
