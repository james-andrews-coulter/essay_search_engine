        <h4>3. Explore Reverie</h4>
<p>If you have the opportunity to watch a very young child, who is comfortable and content and neither hungry nor stressed, you can often observe an almost mystical, indescribable
  expression: the baby’s eyes are fixed on some object – very often a loved face – but are also unfocused. The child can take on a Buddha-like appearance – completely intent
  and completely relaxed. Donald Winnicott believed that the capacity to be alone, to enjoy solitude in adult life, originates in these moments, with the child’s experience of being
  ‘alone in the presence of the mother’. (It does not need to be the biological mother who can offer the child this gift.) He postulates a moment in which the child’s immediate
  needs – for food, warmth, physical and emotional contact – have been satisfied, so that there is no need for the infant to be looking for anything; she is free just to be.</p>
<p>Winnicott is describing in psychoanalytical terms what the Psalm writer wrote nearly 4,000 years earlier in spiritual terms:</p>
<p>See, I have set my soul in silence and in peace;</p>
<p>As the weaned child on its mother’s breast,</p>
<p>So even is my soul.</p>
<p>(Psalm 131:1–3)</p>
<p>Both Winnicott and the Psalmist are paying attention here to the experience of the child – but reflecting on my own life, I would say that at their very best these rich
  and lovely moments are entirely mutual. I think that the hours spent thus with my children, especially after the night feeds, were key experiences which encouraged me (literally – gave me the
  courage) to explore silence and solitude with hope and engagement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the way most of us were brought up, with an immensely strong focus on stimulation, engagement and interaction, means that too many of us have become adults with no experience of
  and no capacity for solitude; not because we were neglected or frightened or emotionally isolated but simply because we got no safe practice in our infancy, always being joggled and sung to and
  dandled and put down and picked up and talked to and interacted with.</p>
<p>As we grew up this continued. Despite the simple fact that the number of abductions and murders of children by strangers has not increased since the 1950s (approximately fifty children are
  murdered each year in the UK; but over two-thirds of these are killed by a parent or principal carer, not by a stranger) and remains remarkably rare, the fear of it has increased exponentially.
  This is very odd. It means that even people who can recall how joyful and important time alone was to them as children do not hand this message on to the next generation, but instead wrap the whole
  idea of solitude in a blanket of anxiety and fear. This increases our nervousness about it, which makes us more reluctant to try it out and often more frightened than there is any need to be.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a ‘technique’ (if that is the right word) for making good some of this loss. In 1913 the psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875–1961), having broken with his friend and
  mentor Freud and been cut off by the impending war from much of his erstwhile social circle, experienced a sort of breakdown, what he himself described as a horrible ‘confrontation with the
  unconscious’, including voice-hearing and hallucinations. He was terrified that he might be becoming psychotic, but bravely decided to confront his fears with a sort of self-analysis. In
  solitude he worked himself into a state of reverie – a kind of concentrated daydreaming which he called ‘active imagination’. He deliberately and as detachedly as possible worked
  through his own memories and dreams and his emotional reactions to them, and then recorded the sessions in notebooks.</p>
<p>He came to believe that this had proved extremely valuable, and in later clinical practice, especially with older clients, would help people learn to do this for themselves. Because of our
  contemporary emphasis on object relations (and conceivably because of professional and ego-centred considerations) this ‘treatment’ has mainly dropped out of the mainstream (although
  you can get some basic practical advice online if you search for ‘self-analysis’).</p>
<p>Even without Jung’s alarming experiences, reverie is a useful way of setting boundaries and patterns to an initial exploration of solitude. One way of using this idea is to place
  yourself in comfort and safety and then actively seek significant memories of particular states of mind. One interesting feature that psychologists are uncovering is that when people seek moments
  of happiness, particularly elevated, unitive moments – when the daydreamer uses the active imagination to remember feeling joyfully bound to the whole earth or even universe – they are
  most likely to be associated with being alone, and often alone outside. Anthony Storr, in Solitude, associates this free-roaming solitary pursuit as a particular feature of highly creative
  people, especially writers. But I myself suspect that it is writers who are best at recording these moments, and that anyone who has had the opportunity to be alone for even relatively brief
  periods of time as a child can find and re-experience this intense pleasure.</p>
<p>Too often such delights get overlaid by the more social demands of young adulthood, by our own fears of isolation and of being thought weird, and by the culturally inculcated terror of solitude.
  Reverie is both highly pleasurable in itself and is also a fairly safe way of re-accessing memories.</p>
<p>Most such acts of recall come with a startling vividness – this is one of the ways that people authenticate their own memories. ‘It must be true because it feels so complete and
  satisfying; it must be true because it feels true.’ In fact, we now know that memories of childhood are extremely unreliable and are to a large extent confabulations; they are creative acts,
  constantly in flux and transformation. To me this makes the amazing frequency with which people remember childhood moments of solitude in a positive and often romantic glow all the more
  interesting. It seems to suggest that as adults many of us have a deep and real longing for more solitude than we are presently getting.</p>
<p>Such practices can, incidentally, throw up quite disturbing material. If this all becomes consistently more frightening than either pleasurable or interesting, it is worth checking whether you
  are actually exhaling enough (hyperventilation is easy to slip into and produces weird physical effects), and otherwise give yourself a break. I am not proposing this as necessary therapy, but as a
  rather effective way to enjoy solitude more. If it does not work, does not achieve this end for you, do something different.</p>
