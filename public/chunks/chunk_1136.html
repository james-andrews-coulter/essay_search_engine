        <h2>Paranal Observatory, Chile</h2>
<p>four g,2-metre-diameter telescopes that + on top of Mount Paranal in Chile’s Atacama si ert were constructed (by a coalition of Peecan countries) ostensibly in order to study the universe, in particular = explore gammaray bursts, detect gravitational wave forces and search for exoplanets. More accurately, however, these masterpieces of science have excelled at quelling our spirits and reconciling us to our fate by artfully reminding us of our beautifully negligible place in the totality of
cosmic space and time, In the rainshadow of the Andes, it is clear almost every night in this part of Chile, and as soon as twilight ends, the most sublime and redemptively terrifying display begins. The atmosphere seems to peel away and we are left standing on a small promontory on the edge of galactic infinity. There are more than 100 billion stars above us. Light takes 100,000 years to pass from one extremity of the Milky Way to the other. At the centre is a black hole, millions of times more massive than our Sun, around which we are spiralling once every 240 million years. Our galaxy is one of many huddling together in what is sweetly called the Local Cluster: itself a tiny, forgettable, random province in the vastly grander scheme of the comprehensible cosmos. The brightest star in the Chilean night sky is Sirius, 8.6 light years away. The nearest Proxima Centauri is still an utterly unreachable 4.2 light years away. With the naked eye, We can see Omega Centauri, a 12-billion-yearold globular cluster packed with 10 million stars. Through a modest pair of binoculars, we may fae the Centaurus A galaxy (NGC 5128), the a brightest in the sky, 12 million light years ¥ and containing at its centre a super eae black hole of 55 million solar masses, *Jecting X-ray jets thousands of light years long. ir All this is not a fantasy or a dream or Ystic vision. It’s a sober, accurate, slowly no goal we are supposed to reach, no task we are required to fulfil. From the point of view of the galaxy and of the whole universe, our hopes and regrets are of no importance, our blunders can do no harm, our errors will have no impact. Our actions count for zero; it doesn’t matter what we do.
As we contemplate the Milky Way from our Chilean vantage point, we shrink down to size. By recalling that we, and our world, are of no ultimate significance, we’re not really saying that we should stop caring. Rather, we’re reducing our responsibility to bearable proportions. We’re not preaching complacency to ourselves; we’re keeping our panic and gloom at bay so that we can turn our more settled minds to a proper analysis of what we are capable of. There are people who don’t care enough, and they may need a very different intervention, but we may be among those caught up in a poignantly odd situation. We may regularly need to care less for a time, in order best to serve those we love.</p>
