        <h3>8We believe we are special</h3>
<p>The statistics are not encouraging. Everyone has before them plenty of examples of terrible marriages. They’ve seen their friends try it and come unstuck. They know perfectly well that – in general – marriages face immense challenges. And yet we do not easily apply this insight to our own case. Without specifically formulating it, we assume that misery is a rule that applies to other people.</p>
<p>That’s because a raw statistical chance of one in two of failing at marriage seems wholly acceptable, given that – when we are in love – we feel we have already beaten far more extraordinary odds. The beloved feels like around one in a million. With such a winning streak, the gamble of marrying a person seems entirely containable.</p>
<p>We silently exclude ourselves from the general principle of marital unhappiness. We’re not to be blamed for this. But we could benefit from being encouraged to see ourselves as invariably a little more exposed to the general fate.</p>
