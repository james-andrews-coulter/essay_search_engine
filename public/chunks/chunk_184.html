        <h1>2. The Senses</h1>
<p>‘What is called our experience is almost entirely determined by our habits of attention.’</p>
<p>(WILLIAM JAMES)</p>
<p>In December 2004 the Jarawa tribe headed away from the coast, where they liked to hunt turtles, and up into the hill country of the Andaman Islands. Then the biggest wave
  imaginable hit the shore.</p>
<p>The Jarawa had managed to sense and escape the Asian tsunami that destroyed the ground and life where they had been standing. They were tuned to the clues of imminent upheaval in the land, sea
  and animals around them, and this instinctive sensory awareness saved their lives. The cry of birds and the way marine animals’ behaviour changed shortly before the tsunami gave the
  indigenous people just enough warning to escape to higher ground.</p>
<p>The Jarawa saved their lives, but this chapter is about the way the senses that help preserve our lives can also enhance our lives. There is a gulf between being alive and dead, but this gulf is
  not the same size for everybody. John Burroughs, an American writer and naturalist in the late nineteenth century, was ahead of the game when he wrote, ‘There is nothing people differ in more
  than in their powers of observation. Some are only half alive.’</p>
<p>Nobody wakes up in the morning and decides to shut down their senses and stumble through each day in an oblivious bubble, and yet some people end up having much richer experiences than others.
  If two people go for an identical walk, one of them might have a profounder, more fascinating experience than the other, but why? One reason will be each person’s life experiences to
  date.</p>
<p>A study by the US military found that soldiers of equal military experience did not see the world in the same way. Most critically, some soldiers were markedly better at spotting potential
  dangers, like improvised explosive devices and other ambushes. The two groups that stood out in this research were those with a hunting background and those who came from tough urban
  neighbourhoods. These groups had clearly been conditioned by their former experiences to see the world as a mixture of threats and opportunities: a lack of awareness translated into a bad day of
  different sorts to each group, and, as a consequence, their senses were finely tuned to any anomalies in their landscape.</p>
<p>We are unlikely to want to enlist the help of insurgents or urban thugs to sharpen our senses, and any attempt to hone our senses through the introduction of fear will only appeal to a minority.
  It is true that those who jump off tall buildings with parachutes develop a forensic level of understanding of the elements, but those who make mistakes also experience a marked deterioration in
  their sensual ability when they hit the concrete below at 150 miles per hour. There are better ways to enrich our experience of life.</p>
<p>There is enough evidence of people experiencing the world in transformative ways to make us believe it is both possible and achievable. The improvements we can enjoy from time spent in nature
  are physical and physiological – we become fitter, happier and learn to use our senses more effectively – but they are also philosophical. One of the early pioneers of our modern
  reconnection with nature, Henry David Thoreau, wrote that ‘two or three hours’ walking will carry me to as strange a country as I expect ever to see.’</p>
<p>If we notice ten times as much when we step outside, then one mile will feel like a ten-mile walk used to (to our minds, that is, but mercifully not our legs).</p>
<p>If we wish to notice more, it is a good idea to slow down; and noticing more will itself tend to make you slow down. This is true whatever you focus on. My fascination with natural navigation
  means I am pulled back by wildflowers, clouds, trees, rocks, planets and even puddles. Paths that I could have bounded along as an ignorant teenager have become treacle, as my senses arrest my
  progress. I now find it much harder to go for the really long walks I used to, not because I have lost the ability physically, but because I notice so much now that I am repeatedly confronted with
  the same awkward and unwelcome decision: take too long or ignore things? It takes a certain immaturity to walk over twenty miles in one day and not feel your head overload with sensual input. I
  know.</p>
<p>How many senses are there? Five? Six? Some say between ten and thirty. Proprioception is the sense we have of where our joints are, even though we can’t see them: we can
  tell where our hands are when our eyes are closed. We have all sensed thirst, hunger, tiredness, low blood-sugar . . . It is easy to see how the list grows, but the philosophy for each is identical
  and so we can focus on the ones we know best, and the lessons from these can be applied elsewhere if we choose.</p>
<p>Sight</p>
<p>The sense of sight is the best one to start working with as it is the most familiar and powerful for most people. But this power comes at a cost: our sight is so effective at
  getting the basics done that we lazily overlook its full potential.</p>
<p>Our eyes pass so much detailed information to our brain that our brain has been forced to develop coping and filtering strategies. Inevitably we fail to notice most of what we see, because we
  can only concentrate on a portion of the canvas presented to us. This has been demonstrated with a smile in the ‘gorilla basketball experiment’, where an audience is shown a clip of two
  people passing a basketball to each other and asked to count the number of passes. In the background a man dressed as a gorilla enters the court and wanders about. Asked if they saw anything
  unusual on the court, the audience fails to come up with anything. The audience all laugh at their partial blindness when they are told to watch the clip again and look for the gorilla, not count
  the passes. In another very amusing example of our imperfect visual attention, a film is shown of an actor stopping to ask a stranger for directions. As they chat, a large wooden door is carried
  between them. In the brief moment that they cannot see each other, the actor ducks away and swaps with someone else. As the door is carried away and the view is no longer blocked, the stranger
  continues the conversation, entirely oblivious to the fact they have metamorphosed into a different human being. Both great fun, but what value for those with an interest in nature?</p>
