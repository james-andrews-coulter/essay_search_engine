        <h4>2. Being Ready</h4>
<p>All things are ready if our mind be so.</p>
<p>(WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, HENRY V, ACT IV, SCENE
      III)</p>
<p>It’s very tempting to rush into love. It’s very tempting to think we’re ready to love because we want to – and there’s nothing wrong with that
  wanting. But readiness to even look for a partner, let alone choose one, can be more complicated than it seems. Which is why this second chapter is something of an amber traffic light.</p>
<p>The first amber question to ask is this. Is now the right time to be seeking a committed relationship? There are many life situations, temporary transitions and extended periods where being
  single is essential. Perhaps our focus currently needs to flow inwards to ourselves because our energy needs to flow outwards – maybe to a demanding job, a sick parent (or child), a sudden
  life crisis. If so, though we may want the support of a relationship because we threaten to collapse without it, choosing a partner may actually be the last thing in the world we should be
  attempting. And not just because partnership’s arguably the second hardest challenge of a lifetime – the first is parenting, if you’re wondering – so it shouldn’t be
  undertaken while vulnerable. But also because, vulnerable, we may choose a mate simply as a crutch; crisis over, life healed, that crutch may be superfluous. Unfair to both parties.</p>
<p>There are also many life phases when being single is enough – not because we are running on empty but because we are fulfilled. It can be a hugely enlightening exercise to list the people
  close to you then list the things they give to you, the things that enhance your life. Company, conversation, common history – or that simplest of support, a hug. Do this exercise and it may
  gradually dawn on you that most if not all of your needs are being met at the moment. If so, you may opt to put partner choice on hold – or choose a mate who fills the current gap even if
  they don’t offer the traditional 24/7 comprehensive companionship.</p>
<p>Staying on amber</p>
<p>The next amber question is even more challenging. Is it ever the right time to be choosing a partner? It’s said that the best thing in life is to be happily partnered and
  the next best thing is to be happily single – but for some people the hierarchy’s reversed. Some of us are entirely whole without additions, flourish better without distractions, are
  simply happier alone.</p>
<p>If you suspect you’re more contented when single, consider – and not just as a passing thought – whether partnership may not be what you are meant to do with your life. The
  ideal of singledom is highly valued in many spiritual traditions less because of puritanism than because it frees us to follow our real vocation. The composer Robert Schumann, when he achieved his
  initial musical success, is said to have compared it to his forthcoming marriage in these words: ‘I doubt if being a bridegroom will be in the same class with these first joys of being a
  composer . . . I now . . . marry the wide world.’ If you are seeking a relationship only because it is what ‘everyone’ does, try on for size the possibility that you are not
  everyone. You are special and the best way for you to thrive may be to ‘marry the wide world’.</p>
<p>Planning</p>
<p>For the rest of us there are still the practicalities to consider. Do we actually have room in our lives right now to hold down a committed relationship? The reality is that
  online dating, for example, will likely take up an hour each night – the equivalent of a working day each week for anything up to a year.</p>
<p>And once the search is over, life will be even more overextended. For love may be wonderful, but it demands time, space, energy and a willingness to accommodate. And while statistically our
  formal working hours at the start of the twenty-first century are apparently almost half those we endured at the start of the nineteenth, the additional claims on that time, space and energy
  – by family, friends, hobbies, housework, travelling, childcare, texts, email, Twitter, Facebook and the miscellaneous demands of living – are arguably double what they were a hundred
  years ago.</p>
<p>The extra sting in the tale is that the more successful we’ve been in life up to now, the more we’ve developed our career, expanded our social life and gained a rewarding lifestyle,
  the less room we have for partnership. The more established we are in our world, the less flexibility we have for allowing a partner into that world. To love, we may have to sacrifice at least some
  of the rest of our lives. (For moving stories from people who feel they’ve not sacrificed as they should have done, see the website www.notimeforlove.com, which describes itself as a project
  to acknowledge that ‘in a reality where time is finite, prioritizing love, in any form, can be challenging’.)</p>
<p>Stop? Go? Wait? Hesitate? Panic and stay pinned to the pavement?</p>
<p>Try this exercise. Map out your typical week – morning, afternoon, evening. Indicate which of those twenty-one time segments are currently full to the brim, then judge how many segments
  you would – or could – happily drain in order to make room for a relationship. Then ask what having a relationship might drain from the rest of your life and what the rest of your life
  might drain from a relationship. Is the bargain worth it? This is not, you understand, to dissuade you from the journey, but to make the advance planning more realistic.</p>
<p>Facing fears</p>
<p>Which brings us to the question of emotional readiness. Here, the elephant in the room is typically the emotion of fear – particularly because choosing a partner also
  involves the intimidating challenge of being chosen.</p>
<p>When I ask the men and women in my dating classes to think of one word to describe how they feel about partner choice, what is mentioned more than anything else is some variation on the fear
  concept; unease, wariness, anxiety, terror. As well as fear of making the wrong choice, we suffer fear of being rejected – ‘I’m too fat, too shy’; fear of being left on the
  shelf – ‘I’m too old, too boring’; and fear of being shamed by being left on the shelf, particularly when our peers all seem to have clambered down from said shelf and are
  now happily mated. Though on that last point, be aware that one never knows what goes on behind closed doors. Not to encourage Schadenfreude, but many of the couples who seem most happy
  now will be the ones sobbing on your shoulder when they hit their first divorce in a few years’ time.</p>
<p>There’s also huge fear of admitting the fear. We don’t want to confess – in this age of self-possession – that we’re struggling, that we’re not completely
  fine about the whole partner-choice business. Bridget Jones’s Diary made us laugh at Bridget’s dating struggles not only because her errors redeemed ours but also because her
  fight for control over life and love made us more able to break the silence and admit our own struggle to ourselves and to others. And Bridget’s final triumphant union with Mark Darcy, when
  it came, reassured us that there could be a good result even for those of us most petrified.</p>
<p>Since Bridget, many books – both fiction and self-help – have urged a ‘fake it till you make it’ attitude to fear. But there is another way. More recently, and to my mind
  more usefully, we’ve started to embrace the suggestion that vulnerability may be better than bravado. Writer Brenè Brown, in her book Daring Greatly, brings the fear story up
  to date when she talks about the huge courage it takes to even consider entering a relationship, let alone doing so – but how the act of revealing the fear behind that courage is a key first
  step on the road to successful partnership. This is vulnerability. This is ‘daring greatly’.</p>
<p>Many of us already do just this. When my class participants confess their lack of self-confidence, I often look round the room awed by what these men and women are bringing to the field.
  Intelligence, personality, talent – but, above all, the courage and willingness, often despite earlier heartbreak, to dare greatly once again. Because of that, surely success is certain. As
  the Chinese proverb says, ‘Pearls don’t lie on the seashore. If you want one, you have to dive for it.’ And we do.</p>
<p>Available or not?</p>
<p>Being ready for love also depends not only on being emotionally open but also emotionally available. The crucial instance of this is that, however long it is since our last
  relationship, if we still grieve that story, if we secretly hope to open up its pages again, we can’t move on to our life’s next volume. Yes, it’s common to believe that a new
  romantic connection will begin a new chapter. Scan the tabloid headlines and we find numerous triumphal reports of newly loved-up celebrities who underwent break-ups just a few weeks ago. Scan the
  online dating sites and we similarly discover the many profiles saying ‘We separated last week so now I’m keen to find love again’.</p>
<p>But the assumption’s unsound. Yes, humans are wired to bond – but when a bond breaks, humans are doubly wired to suffer and that makes us unfit to bond again for a while. Helen
  Fisher, Professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University, MRI-scanned fifteen newly single students and found their brains shimmering with a pain akin to that of going cold turkey from drug
  addiction. So it’s not surprising that post-break-up is rarely the moment when we are emotionally available to connect with another. Problem is, that’s precisely the moment in which we
  may be driven to connect in order to dull the pain – but then, once the injury is healed, find ourselves looking at our newly acquired partner and wondering what on earth we just did.</p>
<p>So how long does it take after losing a love to be truly and wisely available again? There are no schedules here. For recovery after a break-up, the litmus test is whether we can yet think about
  our former partner kindly – or if not, then at least not with hate but with love’s true opposite, indifference. The delightful blog quantifiedbreakup.tumblr.com – by a blogger
  herself in ‘relationship recovery’ – lists several calculations for this, from ‘at least two years’ through ‘half the length of the relationship’ to
  ‘one week for every month you were together’.</p>
<p>When it comes to a variation on the theme of losing a partner – bereavement – the schedule may be more protracted; Jeanette Winterson’s downbeat but arguably accurate appraisal
  in her book Written on the Body, in which her heroine tries to come to terms with her lover’s leukaemia, is ‘To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever.’
  Whatever the situation, the only definitive truth is that being ready for the next relationship will always take just as long as it takes.</p>
<p>Being grown-up</p>
<p>The final, tough-love question about readiness is this. Are we yet ‘grown-up enough’ to pick a partner? Mischievously, that very wording is a test; if we’re
  willing to even consider the question, we’re probably on the way to ready, for success in partner choice often lies in the ability to question ourselves with mature and undefended
  honesty.</p>
<p>On this point, we turn to philosopher and social psychologist Erich Fromm, whose master work, The Art of Loving, is arguably the seminal statement of our contemporary view of what love
  can and should be. Fromm outlines in detail what he sees as the supremely ‘grown-up’ task of partnering another human being. In his view, mature partner choice needs the self-belief
  that we are worth loving, the self-insight to know what we need and the self-control to let go of our needs where necessary. Plus, the ability to teach a partner how to love us, the humility to
  learn from a partner how to love them and the insight to know that love doesn’t just consist of partnership but constitutes, in Fromm’s words, the ‘only sane and satisfactory
  answer to the problem of human existence’. At which point, most of us will run screaming from the room, thinking that for this weight of responsibility we’re not only unprepared right
  now but will always remain so.</p>
<p>Let’s not panic. If we can realize that the ‘art’ Fromm speaks of is not one we’re born with but one which, like any art, we learn, then the challenge becomes more
  manageable. Love is surely not a single act but an ongoing course of lessons. Which means that at this point, as we choose a partner, all we really need to ask ourselves is whether we’re
  ready to fill in the enrolment form.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t only we who need to be ready for love, but also the partner we choose. So it’s more than a good idea to also do due diligence on a potential partner’s
  readiness. We’re not talking here about the relentless first-date quizzing that makes the person on the other side of the restaurant table reach for the bill after the first course, but a
  compassionate awareness of whether the person we are beginning to care for is truly free. Do they have time and room in their life for love? Are they over their past relationship or actually still
  yearning? Are they reaching out to us through genuine attraction or to fill a life gap?</p>
<p>If the answer to any of these questions is ‘unclear’, we may be wiser to step back and allow them the time and space they need. And allow ourselves to find a partner more ready to be
  chosen.</p>
