        <h3>(ii) Vulnerability</h3>
<p>There’s a second crucial criterion for relationship success: the person who is good at love is good at being vulnerable.</p>
<p>What is vulnerability?</p>
<p>We make ourselves psychologically vulnerable whenever we let a partner know some of the ways in which we are weak, needy, scared, immature, incompetent or just plain odd – that is, some of the ways in which we are human. To be vulnerable is to dare to take off the usual cloak of normality and sensibleness with which we navigate the world and, for once, to show someone who we really are, with all the fragility and unusualness implied. We might, as vulnerable people, admit to desiring to be mummied or daddied, to curling into a ball late at night, to crying over so-called small things, to harbouring a distinctive fetish, to wanting to call up our lover every ten minutes, to suffering from anxiety and paranoia, to liking to speak in regressive voices and to having a favourite toy called Yellow Bear.</p>
<p>Why vulnerability is a risk</p>
<p>It’s a hugely complicated step to confess – especially in front of someone we fundamentally want to impress and secure the affection of – that there are basic ways in which we fall short of what a proper adult is meant to be like. A certain kind of no-nonsense partner might well tell us sternly to grow up, complain about us to their friends and make hasty moves to end the relationship.</p>
<p>As a result, we often lie, not for advantage or thievery, but in order to hold on to a love we desperately want to rely on. We pretend to be strong and unafraid. We disown our needs and longings. We put on a show of being someone else. Such acting works in many contexts. An uncomplaining, breezy competence and unemotive intelligence probably makes for an ideal employee, an admirable committee member and a thoroughly respectable citizen of the modern world.</p>
<p>But in an intimate relationship, this form of barricaded caution is fatal. Our fears and inadequacies don’t vanish because we have hidden them; we don’t get any less child-like or odd because we have learnt to seem sensible. We simply end up making it impossible for a partner to know us – and, because they are likely to take their lead from our own reserve, they will be unable to show themselves to us in turn. We enclose ourselves in the high walls of our deceptions.</p>
<p>The heroism of vulnerability</p>
<p>To dare to be vulnerable involves a faith that whatever we are inwardly most afraid and ashamed of in our own natures must have counterparts in other people. We cannot be alone in our oddities. The only people we can assume are ‘normal’ are those we don’t yet know very well. But once we are past the flawless exterior, every person we meet – and especially the person we are now dating – will have their share of follies and tender spots: they will fart, suck their thumbs, be scared of ghosts, have psychological compulsions and worry about the size of their ears or the state of their friendships. We are guaranteed not to be alone in our fear and neediness. And what is more, it’s only on the basis of mutual disclosure of susceptibility that a true bond can be built. We may admire paragons of strength and stoicism; we can never properly love them.</p>
<p>To be vulnerable is in essence to let a partner catch sight of a side of us that dates back to childhood: the distant time when we feared Mummy would never come back, when we cried and no one comforted us, when Daddy shouted at us and we were frozen with terror, when a rough friend told us we were a baby for still loving our stuffed elephant, when no one wanted to play with us at school, when we tried and tried to explain but Granny was still angry. To be properly, fully vulnerable is to take the other into the frightened, small places of our past and to let them see that we’re still in significant ways the little, distressed people we once were. Honest, vibrant love is an encounter between two vulnerable children who otherwise do a very good job of masquerading as adults.</p>
<p>Why we flee from our own vulnerability</p>
<p>What makes people reject the offer of vulnerability? The strength they insist on displaying to the world is an indicator of how punishing they have had to be towards their fragile inner selves; it’s a measure of how fast they have had to grow up. If Mummy dismissed their night-time fears, they will have had to try to tell themselves – desperately – that Mummy was right and that crybabies really are disgusting. They perhaps deflected the rough boys’ taunting of Minko (who Granny knitted while they were still in the womb and whose trunk had half disintegrated under the intensity of their hugs) by throwing the little soft toy in the bin. They managed their traumas by siding with those who hurt them. They focused on keeping their room tidy, passing exams and learning how to do business. And so they came to fear the very thing that they now most need: an enfolding, restorative and profoundly understanding tenderness towards their traumatised early selves. In a grim paradox, to have words of empathy whispered to them lovingly in the dark only reinforces their deepest fears; their protective shell snaps ever more tightly shut at the approach of sympathetic love; they respond to their own needs with panic and self-disgust.</p>
<p>Learning vulnerability</p>
<p>We learn to be vulnerable by understanding that those who conveyed the imperative of a tougher (noncrying, nonfragile) self were profoundly incorrect and, in their way, deeply traumatised themselves. Mummy was dismissive of our fears not because she was impressively astute in her theories of human development but because she was struggling with her own history of unattended need. The anti-Minko ‘friend’ wasn’t showing us the real path to being a grown-up; they were inflicting on us some of the unkindness that had in other contexts been directed at them. We need to go back and convince ourselves – perhaps with a touch of anger – of how misguided the agents of our ‘growing up’ really were.</p>
<p>Finding a partner with whom we can be vulnerable constitutes a supreme act of restoration. After a lifetime of denial and false strength, we stand to find in another the sympathy that was sorely needed, but unavailable to us, in the past. The old wounds can be gently tended; we become stronger by learning to speak the language of weakness. By letting our hurt, babyish selves into the relationship, we open the way to a more nuanced, fruitful, creative and accurate way of being an adult.</p>
