        <h2>Blame vs. responsibility</h2>
<p>Romantics see a lot that is wrong with the world and feel confident about analysing who might be to blame for it: perhaps this particular social group or that class … A problem can’t just be no one’s fault, and therefore the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers and respond appropriately. Romantics feel a basic trust in their own capacity for purity. They are sure they would be unable to be as shabby as their enemies, whom they can therefore attack with a clean conscience.</p>
<p>Melancholic voters also notice what is wrong but are highly aware of their own capacity for sinfulness and error, which makes them hesitant about apportioning blame. They recognise how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances had been different, and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness. They would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately distributed across all groups and classes, and that a priority, therefore, is for us to tolerantly cut each other slack at every turn.</p>
