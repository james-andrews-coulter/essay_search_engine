        <h3>3. Honesty vs Politeness</h3>
<p>The Romantic person is devoted to saying what they think or feel. They are allergic to the idea of being fake or of having secrets. Authenticity is vital. They imagine politeness as a very dull lid that suppresses what really matters – and hence as being at odds with their idea of what a relationship should be like.</p>
<p>The Classical person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us. They believe deeply in getting on around other people. It is not that they are afraid of ruffling their partner’s feathers per se – but they just doubt whether it is usually a very constructive move and they are not interested in merely symbolic victories. They would prefer to have civil relations with the person they live with rather than always tell them emphatically what is on their mind. They accept an important role for secrets and white lies in love.</p>
