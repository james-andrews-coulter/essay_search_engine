        <h2>SELF-ACCEPTANCE</h2>
<p>We know well enough the modern mantra that we are what we earn and that we count only in relation to the scale of our achievements. But it is open to us also to question this so-called meritocratic logic and to adopt a more generous point of view, one in which we count simply because we exist, and that our achievements, be they stellar or doomed, should not be the measure of the whole of us. We can throw off the idea that we always get what we deserve and that any reversal has to be judged as earned and therefore labeled just. We can accept the truth of an extraordinary redemptive idea that the modern age cannot tolerate: that it might be possible to fail in the eyes of the world and yet to remain valuable and deserving of love.</p>
