        <h2>1. A Practical Way In</h2>
<p>For a guide to natural navigation, my own book The Natural Navigator (Virgin, 2010) offers a thorough tour of the subject and is a good place to start. You may also
  find useful How to Find Your Way Without Map or Compass, by Harold Gatty (Dover, 2003).</p>
<p>When it comes to practical advice on foraging, The Forager’s Handbook by Miles Irving (Ebury, 2009), is well written, well produced and comprehensive. Another excellent book is
  Food for Free, by Richard Mabey (HarperCollins, 1992). This modern classic has helped trigger a renaissance in an atrophying skill.</p>
<p>Tom Brown, Jr has written many good books on the subject of tracking. The one that complements the approach of this book best is Tom Brown’s Field Guide to Nature Observation and
  Tracking (Berkley Books, 1983).</p>
<p>Teachers and parents will find lots of inspiration in Sharing Nature with Children, by Joseph Cornell (Dawn Publications, 1998). It describes itself as ‘The Classic Parents’
  and Teachers’ Nature Awareness Guidebook’, which seems about right to me.</p>
