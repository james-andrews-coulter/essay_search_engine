        <h2>VIGILANCE</h2>
<p>We’ll need to monitor ourselves with special care, vigilant for signs of deterioration and vortices of despair. Our minds are prone to amnesia: We forget what we have learned about ourselves and what has kept us steady. We may have worked out the basic structure of our illness in therapy. We may know that we are prone to self-sabotage, that we carry a trauma with us from the past, that we are inclined to destroy everything that is good about our lives and alienate those who want to care for us. But such knowledge will always be vulnerable to destructive impulses that can sweep away our patient intellectual labor and catapult us back into a state of helpless and frightened infancy. We should be ready to be submerged by negativity and not experience our retreat as a humiliation, confident that ebbs and flows are normal and that we will be able to hold on to at least some of our gains.</p>
