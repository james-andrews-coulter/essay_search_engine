        <h2>Friends of Friendship</h2>
<p>One of civilisation’s main ambitions is to help us turn what might seem like lucky accidents into regular and repeatable experiences. We see this in agriculture, which seeks to produce regular supplies of the sorts of foods that our earliest ancestors would have viewed as unique and rare blessings. What was once a lone berry bush will make way for a whole field of cultivated crops. But civilisation, with its powers of reasoning, logic and organisation, does not need to limit itself to the production of material goods. It might – wielded correctly – be the instrument that helps us to acquire psychological nutrients too, including those of friendship. Often we still think of a good friendship as a lucky accident. We imagine that we alight on a great friend with some of the happenstance of stumbling on a succulent fruit tree. We don’t think that we can plot to make friends as we might plot to grow strawberries or harvest apricots. But such modesty is not grounded in truth. We could set out to crack the code of friendship as we would the puzzle of plant biology. We can go in search of the constituents of successful friendship and systematically identify the friends of friendship.</p>
