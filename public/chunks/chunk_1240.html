        <h2>Elsewhere</h2>
<p>Before we even get to any of their specific qualities, many places end up feeling therapeutic for a reason as simple as it is essential: because they are first and foremost symbolic of ‘elsewhere’. They are valuable because they speak of a departure from everything that is normal and habitual for us — at a point when our spirits and powers of imagination have become depleted and we are on the verge of losing faith because of all that we know.</p>
<p>We go abroad and thrill at distinctive new buildings, lights, customs, clothes, accents, flavours, names and road signs. We do so not only for these elements themselves, but because they hint to us in a broader way about the idea of alternatives. They are reminders that we cannot have exhausted all possible options, given that so much that is unexpected and unheralded still exists — and therefore the world remains a far broader, more unpredictable and more option-rich place than we had assumed in our despair.</p>
<p>Central to many states of sadness is a feeling of predictability. We sigh because things are bad right now, but also because we believe we know the rest of the story, for all time: the marriage will not improve, there will be no way out of our professional difficulties, we can’t picture how our enemies would stop gossiping, society seems utterly set in its ways, daft ideas will permanently be granted prestige, our melancholy will never lift. A sense of ‘sameness’ isn’t an accidental feature of sad moods; sadness is underpinned by the sapping belief that what is now will always have to be.</p>
<p>It may not matter too much what sparks the reminder of the idea of ‘elsewhere’. It could be the sound of Danish on the streets of Aalborg, the smell of thyme and cinnamon in the markets of Fez, a poster in downtown Hoi An written in the Vietnamese alphabet (Chữ Quốc ngữ), or the light at dawn in the Atacama Desert. Or it might be time spent reflecting on the mud-and-brick Towers of Silence in central Iran, some of the most haunting and peculiar buildings in the history of the world’s least-known major faith, Zoroastrianism. We might look at the structures — originally used to lay out the bodies of the dead for birds of prey to strip the flesh from the bones — and be stirred by an evocation of all the odd details of Zoroastrianism that still await our discovery: the worship of the god-like deity Ahura (Lord) Mazda (wisdom); the belief in the conflict between asha (order and reason) and druj (chaos and lies); the faith in a saviour figure called Frashokereti who will bring about a time of renewal when the souls of the dead will be weighed and the righteous will enter a paradisiacal land called Kshatra Vairya; and the veneration of a holy book called the Avesta. These are the tenets of the world’s first monotheistic faith, which came to prominence 2000 years before Christianity.</p>
<p>We are not really fed up with life, only with the tiny slice of it that we know and that has (understandably) disappointed us in too many ways. We need contact with an ‘elsewhere’ to dislodge us from sterility and reawaken us to wonder. We need to surprise and dehabituate ourselves back to health.</p>
