        <h2>17.The Little Restaurant</h2>
<p>Almost all of us are, when we travel, in search of this ideal establishment: the little restaurant. Let’s picture it for ourselves. It’s fairly small, ten or a dozen tables. It’s unpretentious; the floor and the walls are quite bare and the chairs simple in the extreme. The place has no anxiety about itself. It knows it does its job well and has no need to be ingratiating with its customers. The grilled fish is good enough for the lightbulbs on the wall to be left exposed without shame. The menu is extremely short, and perhaps chalked up on a blackboard by the till every day. Everything is simple, fresh, yet absolutely remarkable. It comes quickly, the waiters are friendly and unfussy, the water comes in an old wine bottle – and the bill, when it arrives, is very modest indeed. As we pay, we think to ourselves that this truly is the perfect restaurant.</p>
<p>The problem is that such places are woefully rare. Every traveller is in search of such an establishment and yet they are as elusive as gold dust. Why are we, collectively, not better at making little restaurants?</p>
<p>The romantic answer is that these businesses are the result of genius, and cannot be made to spring up in large numbers. But that cannot be true. The reality is that the lovely little restaurant isn’t a chance aberration; it’s founded on a set of reasonable, logical and teachable ideas about what makes people happy. If we understood ourselves and human nature a little better, there could conceivably be countless such ‘locals’.</p>
<p>Through the prism of the little restaurant, we meet with a big truth about travel: we’re not very good at understanding what really makes us content. Our answers tend towards the expensive, the grandiose, the sentimental and the kitsch. We aren’t good at working back from what we really enjoyed and then designing businesses that can cater to it.</p>
<p>If we were cannier about our pleasures, we’d ensure that we spent more time chatting with people and less time in museums; that we’d be less seduced by whale-watching trips and more alert to the interest of walking around foreign supermarkets.</p>
<p>And we’d grasp that we were less interested in the grand and ornate brasserie, and more attuned to the distinctive charms of the little restaurant. Going travelling collides us repeatedly with a big, difficult, but also in a sense rather exciting idea: that we’re collectively still at the dawn of knowing how to make ourselves properly happy.</p>
