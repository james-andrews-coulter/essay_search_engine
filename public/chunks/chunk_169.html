            <h3>¶ Warmth</h3>
<p>Although politeness is always preferable to rudeness, there are ways of being polite that badly miss the mark and can leave us, as its recipients, feeling oddly detached and dissatisfied. Picture the person who ends up, despite their best efforts, seeming what we can call ‘coldly’ polite. They may be extremely keen to please those they are seeing, they obey all the rules of etiquette, yet never manage to make their hospitality feel engaging or memorable. It may be a long time before another meeting with them is suggested.</p>
<p>By contrast, there is the person who exhibits the virtue of ‘warmth’; someone who follows the cold person in the basic principles of politeness, but manages to add a critical emotionally comforting ingredient to their manner. When we have an evening planned with them, they might suggest making toasted cheese sandwiches at their place rather than going out to a restaurant; they might chat to us through the bathroom door, put on the songs they loved dancing to when they were fourteen, plump up a cushion and slot it behind our back, confess to feeling intimidated by a mutual acquaintance, bring us a posy of daisies or a card they made and, when we’re down with the flu, call us up and ask how our ears are feeling.</p>
<p>The difference between the warm and the cold person lies in a contrasting vision of human nature. Broadly, the cold person is operating with an implicit view that those they are attempting to please are creatures endowed only with the highest needs. As a result, all kinds of assumptions are made about them: that they are interested exclusively in so-called serious topics (especially art and politics); that they will appreciate a degree of formality in dining and sitting; that they will be strong, self-contained and mature enough not to have any hunger for reassurance or cosiness, and that they will be without urgent physical vulnerabilities and drives that might prove offensive if they were mentioned.</p>
<p>Conversely, the warm person is always aware that the stranger is (irrespective of their status or outward dignity) a highly needy, fragile, confused, appetitive and susceptible creature. They know this about the stranger because they never forget this about themselves.</p>
<p>They know that however solid and dignified someone appears on the outside, behind the scenes there will inevitably be a struggling self, potentially awkward, easily bemused, beset by physical appetites, on the verge of loneliness, and frequently in need of nothing more subtle or elevated than a cheese sandwich, a glass of milk and a hug.</p>
<p>In a warm social manner we’re catching sight of a major theme: the lower and ‘bad’ parts of a person are accepted and integrated into a more accurate picture of who they are. Warmth is a central way in which we get closer to other people through a due understanding of our collective human nature and thereby reduce the burdens of loneliness.</p>
