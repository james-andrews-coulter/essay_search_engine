            <h1>2. Relating to Others</h1>
<p>A brain, like a neuron, is not much use on its own. Our brains need other brains – or, as we more often put it, people need people. We may think of ourselves as an ‘I’, and the notion of the isolated self takes up a lot of space in Western civilization, but we are in fact creatures of the group, like starlings in a flock that appears as one body against the sky, with each bird affecting and being affected by the movements of the birds closest to it. Our brains are linked together and grow together in relationship with each other.</p>
<p>We understand that the quality of the formative relationships we had as infants determines our initial place in the spectrum of mental health. However, it is also known that other people continue to be our best resource for staying sane. Any mutually impactful, mutually open relationship can reactivate neuroplastic processes11 and actually change the structure of the brain at any stage of our lives.</p>
<p>I have seen such changes time and time again in many years of practice as a psychotherapist. I have witnessed clients become more fully themselves, more at ease and less neurotic. I believe that it is the relationship with the therapist, as much as any brilliant intervention, that brings these changes about. I learnt from Irvin Yalom, an American psychiatrist, that as a therapist you need to assess how clients feel about the therapeutic relationship, and ask them what was useful and what did not work in each session. As a young therapist I was often surprised that it was not new insight that was the most powerful catalyst for change, but the moment when the client saw that they had moved me; or when they felt accepted because I patted their arm; or when they saw that, even if I did not say anything at that point, I understood. But that is only half of it. I was changed by my clients too: they helped me to grow. In a relationship in which we are ourselves without a social mask and fully present, our brains are continually shaped. Seeing the world from another’s viewpoint as well as our own can allow us both to expand. If we get too ‘set in our ways’, we are less able to be touched, moved or enlightened by another and we lose vitality. And we need to allow ourselves to be open to the impact of the other if we are to impact upon them.</p>
