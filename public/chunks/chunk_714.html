        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>What is it that we might need to know of the developmental challenges in ourselves and another?</p>
<p>Trust</p>
<p>•   How able are we to believe that another person might sincerely like us?</p>
<p>•   How able are we to believe that someone might seem kind, but still – for their own reasons – be out to hurt us?</p>
<p>•   How do our patterns of trust and suspicion fit into events in our pasts?</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>•   How easily can we tell someone that they have disappointed us?</p>
<p>•   How easily can we tell someone that we like them?</p>
<p>•   How prone are we to fall into a sulk? Why do we imagine we might do so?</p>
<p>Vulnerability</p>
<p>•   How ready are we to show someone else the small, fragile, unimpressive version of ourselves?</p>
<p>•   Would we let another adult ‘baby’ us at points? How does the question feel?</p>
<p>•   Can we believe that we could be known and still liked?</p>
<p>Childhood narratives</p>
<p>•   What went wrong at the start?</p>
<p>•   How annoyed do you feel about being asked about the early years?</p>
<p>•   What complications has your mother caused you? And your father?</p>
<p>•   How are you damaged?</p>
<p>It sounds improbable and even insulting to persist with the idea that how we can get on in a relationship as adults should be so closely connected to what happened when our bike still had its training wheels. We may balk at having to discount the massive addition of experience in the intervening years – but we would be even more at risk if we didn’t.</p>
