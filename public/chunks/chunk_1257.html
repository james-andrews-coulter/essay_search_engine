        <h2>The Foreign Bedroom</h2>
<p>The desire to travel is closely identified by respectable opinion with the aspiration to explore a place through its culture—that is, to know it through its paintings, sculpture, architecture and, perhaps, at a stretch, its music and its food.
The truth is somewhat more complicated and, in areas, delicate. If the real wish is to absorb the insights and strengths of another culture, these cannot reside only, or even chiefly, in old stones and canvases; they must also be present in the people who live and work among a society’s historic artefacts. However dispiriting the concept of sexual tourism, it sits awkwardly close to a theme of sincere significance. The deeper promises of a journey may be as capable of being honoured in a foreign bedroom as they are in a temple or archaeological site; a foreign love affair might be the privileged conduit to the virtues of another land.
Yet nothing in the way that travel is presently arranged helps this idea to take root with dignity. It remains extremely difficult to meet people whose culture has touched us. We may see them coming home from work or chatting animatedly in a supermarket and might wonder, with a degree of pain, what their lives might be like, what is happening behind the apartment windows, what ideas they might have, how much they might have to teach us. We may long to commune not just with mighty figures seven generations back, but also with our contemporaries, who walk through the old medieval streets and around the ancient monuments while fetching groceries or buying printer cartridges.
But if we are fortunate, we might, late one evening, find ourselves being led up some steep stone stairs to a small top-floor apartment, and there delighting not only in the emotional and physical endorsement, but also in the distinctive appearance of the books on the bedside table, the creams in the bathroom and the photos
pinned in the kitchen next to some unfamiliar pastes and dried herbs. The following morning, we might feel a particular resonance when our new friend mentions an uncle coming for a wedding from an adjoining island, or a brother returning from military service in the mountains.
It won’t appear in any guidebooks and to mention it can be fraught, but the sensitive truth is that a foreign bedroom is as likely to deliver us an education as anything we might lay eyes on in the halls of the national museum.</p>
