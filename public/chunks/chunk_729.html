            <h2>REPUTATION &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>Reputation might be defined as the claim that one can make on the goodwill of strangers; it is what your name will mean to those who don’t know you, who spend almost no time thinking of you. It’s what you will get reduced to when you aren’t illuminated by love. How your reputation is assessed depends on the extent to which you have fulfilled, or violated, the ideals and aspirations of your society. Most of us are properly known to, and liked by, five to ten people. When it comes to everyone else, reputation is what will decide what we have been worth.</p>
<p>Reputation can’t buy us love, but it can provide us with those valuable proxies: respect, honour and politeness. Those who are kind to us may not mean it, but they are at least making an effort. Not all of us crave equally the warmth that comes with a good reputation. Those with a particularly strong need for applause tend to be those with a weak sense of their own acceptability. The cheer of the crowd is asked to compensate for an innate feeling of shame. We seek the validation of the world when we are, inside, unconvinced that we are quite deserving. The more we have been humiliated, especially when young, the more the goodwill of strangers will matter; and – conversely – the more we have tasted genuine affection, the less interesting reputation can be.</p>
<p>The problem is that reputation is gossamer thin; or like a soapy bubble or an unstable chemical compound, some metaphor to suggest the ease with which it can be torn or destroyed. It is so prone to disappear because it is based not on knowledge or experience of one’s deep self but on the candy floss of hearsay and third-hand gossip. It’s the unconscious supposition of people who haven’t thought very deeply about who one is and have absolutely no wish to do so either; it’s what people who don’t care about us think about us. This is what makes reputation so delightful when it is going our way. Our nobility becomes part of the unthinking common sense of the community. But this is also what makes things so tricky when reputation falls apart. The only way in which our good name might be rescued in the minds of others is if they gave us some thought – which is precisely what they have never done before and won’t now begin to either.</p>
<p>Reputation will rise and fall according to how closely we track or depart from the ideals of our society – and these tend to be pegged to financial success, sexual propriety, decorum, marriage, sobriety, the sanctity of family and the purity of children. The more of these ideals one flouts, the harsher will be the penalties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are – all of us – error-prone animals or, to put it more bluntly, idiots. We should say sorry to the universe every day, given how we are. We’re impulsive, greedy, lustful, vain and selfish. Which means that every year, a small but significant section of the population makes an apparently minor mistake that causes terrible damage to others and blows up their life along the way. Not for nothing does Western civilisation have at its heart the example of Greek tragedy, which tells us of averagely good people brought low by highly understandable, everyday kinds of folly, for which they pay an ultimate price.</p>
<p>The whole community hears in an instant and one is done for. The punishment may be financial or legal, but the ultimate damage is psychological; one becomes a pariah. In the minds of all those who don’t think about us properly (which is almost everyone), one is now a monster or a numbskull. For life.</p>
<p>From now on, we will need to be looked at through the eyes of love before we re-emerge as in any way human; that is, deserving of even a little pity or understanding. Only through love can we be remembered to have once been a baby, who was innocent, who struggled and who later made mistakes from passing weakness rather than evil. Only through love are there any other sides of the story.</p>
<p>As a result, all those who are not our intimates become sources of sure-fire damning judgement. We know from the outset that they will hate or condemn us. It becomes impossible to go to a party. One probably has to move town. Suicidal thoughts become harder to push away. Ambitions have to change entirely. Everything that depends on the minds of people in general is now impossible. ‘What people might think’ disappears from the calculation; it’s a foregone conclusion. They’ll think – always – that one is a demon.</p>
<p>When those in disrepute rediscover close friends and family (and they almost always do), it isn’t coincidental or a cheap excuse: it’s because they can see, more clearly than ever, that these are the people, the only people, who know them properly and can therefore examine them with any degree of subtlety, as one might a character in a novel. For everyone else, one has disappeared into a single word of insult.</p>
<p>In older, more religious societies, there was the possibility of apology before a divine being, a period of penance and then, eventually, forgiveness. But that is one of the handy mechanisms we unknowingly dismantled when we decided that God was a fiction. We have been left with only one tool, the legal system, which levies fines and prison sentences but isn’t in the business of restoring reputation – and doesn’t get involved in most of the errors that cause it to be lost in the first place. There is, quite literally, in most cases, no way to recover reputation. The sentence is life-long.</p>
<p>We suffer also because we live in such vast societies. Recovery of reputation might have been possible when we lived in tribes of a hundred or so. You could go around and explain things in person, tent by tent. No such chance when it’s a case of having a few hundred million minds to change.</p>
<p>So begins that peculiar challenge, leading a life without a reputation, a feat as arduous, in a way, as hanging on to a cliff-face with bare hands in high wind.</p>
<p>A few moves suggest themselves. For a start, acceptance: of oneself, of the situation, of one’s misdeeds and of the darkness. Then, the construction of a new kind of communal life, one built around astonishing sincerity and vulnerability. One says it like it is. There is no need for yet more shame. A whole new set of friends is called for – before whom one can be truly oneself, in a way one never could be before things fell apart. It helps immensely if these friends have themselves lost reputation. Ex-convicts might be an idea. And fallen business people and politicians. They will have a kindness to them open only to those who have suffered infinitely for their errors. There is only so much empathy and thoughtfulness that blameless people can ever show. Animals are good too; they rarely judge. The immense open spaces of nature offer valuable perspective, as do history books.</p>
<p>Then one should, above all, make friends with Stoic philosophy in general and the philosopher Boethius in particular. For some 400 years across the European Middle Ages, one philosophy book was prized above any other. Present in every educated person’s library, it was titled in Latin De Consolatione Philosophiae or, as we know it in English today, The Consolation of Philosophy. Editions appeared in all the main European languages: Chaucer translated it into English, as did St Thomas More and Queen Elizabeth I, and Dante made it a centrepiece of the intellectual scaffolding of his Divine Comedy. It is one of the finer things one could read at moments of panic.</p>
<p>The book was the work of the Italian statesman, scholar and academic Boethius, who penned it in a few months in appalling circumstances in a prison in Pavia in 523 A.D. Boethius was born into a highly successful and wealthy family in the years after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. From an early age he took an interest in the Classics and translated much of Plato’s and Aristotle’s works from Greek into Latin; it is thanks, in great measure, to his efforts that classical philosophy made its way into the Middle Ages and then to the modern world.</p>
<p>For many years, Boethius’s life was seemingly blessed. He lived in a sumptuous villa in Rome and was married to a kind and beautiful woman called Rusticiana, with whom he had two handsome, clever and affectionate sons. Under a sense of obligation to his society, Boethius eventually entered politics and occupied a number of elevated administrative positions under the ruler of Italy, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. Bertrand Russell wrote of him: ‘He would have been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly amazing.’</p>
<p>But suddenly, in the spring of 523 A.D., Boethius’s fortune ran out. There was a knock at the door and a gang of Theodoric’s guards accused him (quite falsely) of having plotted against the increasingly paranoid and vengeful king. With scarcely time to say goodbye to his family, Boethius was carted off to prison.</p>

<p>Entirely innocent, but also aware of the danger he was in, Boethius fell into despair. In a tiny cell, he contemplated his rapid fall from grace, his love for his family and the unfairness of his destiny. What would eventually lift his spirits – and, at the same time, gift humanity one of its greatest works of prison literature of any time or place – was his decision to think his way philosophically out of his sorrows.</p>
<p>As The Consolation of Philosophy opens, Boethius describes his listless sadness and terror at his state: ‘White hairs are scattered untimely on my head, and the skin hangs loosely from my worn-out limbs.’ But in this downcast state, Boethius receives an unexpected visit: ‘While I was pondering thus in silence, and using my pen to set down so tearful a complaint, there appeared standing over my head a woman’s form, whose countenance was full of majesty, whose eyes shone as with fire and whose power of insight surpassed that of all men….’</p>
<p>His visitor is a metaphorical figure whom Boethius terms Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy is carrying a pile of classical books in one hand and a sceptre in the other – and she has come to visit Boethius in his cell in order to remind him of some of the fundamental truths of his favourite subject, largely as defined by the Stoic school of Greece and Rome. That she should have dropped in on him was, in a sense, no surprise. In the classical world, philosophy was not an abstract academic discipline; it was a set of tools specifically designed to help one live and die well, with particular relevance at the darkest moments.</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy begins by gently chiding Boethius for ‘flaring up against’ his fate. She reminds him, as Stoic philosophers had constantly stressed, that human beings are not in control of most of what happens to them. Our destiny is, in large measure, in the hands of a devilishly powerful seductive goddess whom the Romans knew as Fortuna, the Goddess of Fortune. This figure was a central deity in the Roman pantheon and was represented across the Roman world on coins and statues. She was typically depicted holding a cornucopia in one hand, overflowing with fruit and luxuries, and in the other a tiller, a marker of her capacity to direct people’s fates. Depending on her mood, Fortune might either shower us with gifts or, with a blithe smile, steer us towards catastrophe.</p>
<p>To be a philosopher means to understand all that Fortune controls, to resist her blandishments, to know never to put complete faith in the things that are, ultimately, always in the hands of an immoral and reckless force – and to prepare for the day when we may have to surrender her gifts at a stroke. These gifts comprise most of what we would today think of as the fundamental ingredients of happiness: love, family, children, prosperity, reputation and career. But, for a Stoic philosopher, none of them should be things that the wise should ever really trust – for all of them can be lost in horrific circumstances at any moment.</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy sits with Boethius in his cell and reminds him of his appalling exposure to Fortune’s deceptive charm: ‘I know the many disguises of that monster, Fortune, and the extent to which she seduces with friendship the very people she is striving to cheat, until she overwhelms them with unbearable grief at the suddenness of her desertion.’</p>
<p>But Lady Philosophy also reminds Boethius that the wise have to resist putting their faith in the gifts of Fortune. She introduces a famous image of a Wheel of Fortune, which spins between success and favour – and appalling punishment and pain. Fortune spins the wheel with abandon and merciless cruelty, enjoying the screams of those who, only hours before, were confident of their future.</p>
<p>‘If you are trying to stop her wheel from turning, you of all men are the most obtuse,’ Lady Philosophy tells Boethius. ‘You are seeking to regain what really did not belong to you.’</p>
<p>Fortune herself pipes up at this point and says with chilling candour: ‘Inconstancy is my very essence; it is the game I never cease to play as I turn my wheel in its ever changing circle…. Yes, rise up on my wheel if you like, but don’t count it an injury when by the same token you begin to fall, as the rules of the game will require…. Isn’t this what tragedy commemorates with its tears and tumult?’</p>
<p>Lady Philosophy now gets to the heart of her message. Boethius must, like any good philosophically inclined person, stop trusting in anything that Fortune can take away at once: ‘You know there is no constancy in human affairs, when a single swift hour can often bring a man to nothing. If you are in possession of yourself you will possess something you would never wish to lose and something Fortune could never take away…. Happiness cannot consist in things governed by chance.’</p>
<p>Boethius must retreat to what the Stoic philosophers called his ‘inner citadel’; a minimal self immune from the cruelty of Fortune. Lady Philosophy stresses that a different sort of happiness can be found by focusing on all that Fortune can never make one lose, specifically one’s powers of reasoning, which give one access to the beauty, mystery and complexity of the universe. True philosophers rise above their immediate circumstances, become indifferent to their own fate and identify with the vast forces of history and nature.</p>
<p>It’s a measure of the relevance of Boethius’s message that we today so firmly identify happiness with two areas that lie entirely in the hands of Fortune: romantic love and career success. And, unsurprisingly, we are continually let down here, too, the wheel of fortune spinning us randomly from promise to disgrace, from hope to ruin. Boethius’s provocative message to his own times and to our own is that the best way to find peace of mind may be to perceive the ingredients we associate with happiness as, in truth, direct conduits to a fundamental instability, and thereby to inner torment and anxiety.</p>
<p>Boethius’s wisdom was to be the last eloquent outcry of the guiding ideas of classical philosophy and, in particular, its Stoic branch. Thereafter, Christianity subsumed its insights, which were then further obscured by the scientific optimism of the modern period.</p>
<p>Our own troubled times deserve to witness the rediscovery of the Stoic message. We become philosophers not by writing books or attending university courses, but by appreciating how little of our lives is in our hands, the ubiquity and fickleness of Fortune and our need to look beyond public opinion, family, love and status in order to build up serenity through the exercise of one’s distinctive and fate-independent mental powers.</p>
<p>Boethius was killed, as he feared, a few months after being imprisoned. His grave lies in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d’Oro in Pavia, half an hour from Milan. In his honour, we should leave space for Lady Philosophy occasionally to come and visit us – and, when we are facing the worst turns of Fortune’s wheel, let her strengthen our resolve to depend a little less on what was, in fact, never really ours to rely upon.</p>
