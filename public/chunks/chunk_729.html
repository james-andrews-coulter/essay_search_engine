        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>To begin the patient task of undoing our mind-reading assumptions, consider the following:</p>
<p>1.     What do you feel your partner should really already know about your sensitivities given how long you’ve been together? Make a list that features such details as: interior design, their family, travel arrangements, friendships, politics, your family, shoes, the bathroom …</p>
<p>2.     Now go and see the partner and ask them to go through the items and explore how much they really do know. Correct any shortfalls in knowledge with patience and humour.</p>
<p>3.     Repeat the exercise the other way.</p>
