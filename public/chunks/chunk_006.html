            <h2>A VISCERAL UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p>One of the great impediments to understanding our lives properly is our automatic assumption that we already do so. It’s easy to carry around with us, and exchange with others, surface intellectual descriptions of key painful events that leave the marrow of our emotions behind. We may say that we remember, for example, that we “didn’t get on too well” with our father, that our mother was “slightly neglectful” or that going to boarding school was “a bit sad.”</p>
<p>It could, on this basis, sound as if we surely have a solid enough grip on events. But these compressed stories are precisely the sort of ready-made, affectless accounts that stand in the way of connecting properly and viscerally with what happened to us and therefore of knowing ourselves adequately. If we can put it in a paradoxical form, our memories are what allows us to forget. Our day-to-day accounts may bear as much resemblance to the vivid truth of our lives as a postcard from Naxos does to a month-long journey around the Aegean.</p>
<p>If this matters, it’s because only on the basis of proper immersion in past fears, sadnesses, rages, and losses can we ever recover from certain disorders that develop when difficult events have become immobilized within us. To be liberated from the past, we need to mourn it, and for this to occur, we need to get in touch with what it actually felt like. We need to sense, in a way we may not have done for decades, the pain of our sister being preferred to us or the devastation of being maltreated in the study on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The difference between felt and lifeless memories could be compared to the difference between a mediocre and a great painting of spring. Both will show us an identifiable place and time of year, but only a great painter will properly seize, from among millions of possible elements, the few that really render the moment charming, interesting, sad, or tender. In one case we know about spring, in the other we can finally feel it.</p>
<p>This may seem like a narrow aesthetic consideration, but it goes to the core of what we need to do to recover from many psychological complaints. We cannot continue to fly high over the past in our jet plane while refusing to re-experience the territory we are crossing. We need to land our craft, get out and walk, inch by painful inch, through the swampy realities of long ago. We need to lie down—perhaps on a couch, maybe with music—close our eyes and endure things, metaphorically, on foot. Only when we have returned afresh to our suffering and known it in our bones will it ever promise to leave us alone.</p>
<p>FIGURING OUT WHAT WE REALLY, REALLY THINK</p>
<p>What we really think about, for example, the character of a friend, or the next best move we should make in our career or our stance toward an incident in childhood . . . all of our conclusions on such critical topics can remain locked inside us, part of us but inaccessible to ordinary consciousness.</p>
<p>We operate instead with surface and misleading pictures of our dispositions and goals. We may settle, in haste or fear, on the most obvious answers: our new friend is very kind, we should aim for the most highly paid job, our childhood was “fun.”</p>
<p>We ignore our truths first and foremost because we aren’t trained to solicit them; no one ever quite tells us that we might need to exhibit the patience and wiliness of an angler while waiting at the riverbank of the deep mind. We’ve been brought up to act fast, to assume that we know everything immediately and to ignore the fact that consciousness is made up of layers, and it’s the lower strata that might contain the richest, most faithful material.</p>
<p>We may also be hesitant because the answers that emerge from any descent into the depths and subsequent communion with our inner beings can sound at odds with the settled expectations we have of ourselves in daylight. It might turn out that in fact we don’t love who we’re meant to love, or are scared and suspicious of someone who is pressing us to trust them or are deeply moved by, and sympathetic to, a person we hardly know. It’s the profoundly challenging nature of our conclusions that keeps us away from our inner sanctum. We prioritize a sense of feeling normal over the jolting realizations of the true self.</p>
<p>The steps we need to take in order to check in with ourselves are not especially complicated. We must make time, as often as once a day, to lie very still on our own somewhere, probably in bed or maybe in the bath, to close our eyes and direct our attention toward one of many tangled or murky topics that deserve reflection: a partner, a work challenge, an invitation, a forthcoming trip, a relationship with a child or a parent. We might need a moment to locate our actual concern. Then, disengaged from the ordinary static, we should circle the matter and ask ourselves with unusual guilelessness: What is coming up for me here? Holding the partner, work challenge, invitation, or disagreement patiently in mind, we should whisper to ourselves: What do I really think? What is the real issue? What is truly going on? What is actually at stake?</p>
<p>We should—to sound a little soft-headed—ask ourselves what our heart is whispering to us or what our gut is trying to articulate. We’re striving to access a sincere part of the mind too often crushed by the barking, harried commands of the conformist executive self.</p>
<p>What we will almost certainly find is that, in a quasi-mystical way, the answers are already there waiting for us, like the stars that were present all along and only required the sun to fade in order to come to light in the dome of the sky. We already know—much more accurately than we ever assume—who we should be friends with, what is good and bad for us, and what our purpose on this earth is.</p>
<p>We need only a few moments in the dark at 11 p.m. or 5 a.m. to wander the corridors of the deep mind with the torch of consciousness and ask: What have I looked at but never seen?</p>
