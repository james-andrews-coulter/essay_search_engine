        <h3>2 All is vanity: The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
<p>Many of our efforts are designed to perpetuate ourselves in time. We strive to live on through our work and to make something more enduring than our biological selves. To release us from this exhausting and vainglorious folly, religions used to kindly remind us, in the words of Ecclesiastes 1:2, that all is vanity — and they would occasionally show us a skull or shattered tomb to bring the point home more forcefully.</p>
<p>With religion in abeyance, science offers us a more powerful expression of this Biblical concept: the Second Law of Thermodynamics. First worked out in the nineteenth century, this states that the tendency of all systems — of which the universe is one — will be to dissipate energy over time until it reaches a state of complete rest. Given a sufficient span, estimated as 10106 years, our universe and its superclusters of galaxies will all collapse and we will enter what scientists call a Dark Era, in which — after so much excitement, individual and cosmic — nothing will remain except for a quiet dilute gas of photons and leptons.</p>
<p>The situation is no better closer to home. The sun’s centre burns, like a giant engine, at fifteen million degrees Celsius. But our Sun is four and a half billion years old and the average stable lifespan of a star is a mere eight billion years.</p>
<p>An added complication is that the Sun’s brightness increases by ten per cent every billion years, gradually heating our planet. In one billion years, the Sun’s increased brightness will have caused our oceans to evaporate and made all life impossible. In about four billion years, when it runs out of hydrogen, the Sun will become a ‘red giant’ star, possibly expanding as far as Mars, at which point it will absorb and destroy Earth. The Sun’s outer layers will drift into space to form a planetary nebula. The remaining core will be a dense, stable ‘white dwarf’ that will continue to radiate heat for two or three billion years.</p>
<p>To repeat the point with NASA’s help: all is vanity.</p>
