        <h2>The Sierra Nevada</h2>
<p>The painting itself was vast, and the scene it depicted even more so. After the GermanAmerican artist Albert Bierstadt completed it in 1868, he toured it around Europe, placed a velvet curtain around it and sold tickets so people could view it in fifteen-minute time slots. It won a gold medal from the Academy in Berlin and, after intense bidding, was bought by one of the richest men in America, Alvin Adams, founder of Adams Express, the world’s first high-speed door-to-door courier service. It depicts, with a few liberties, a spot at the base of the tallest mountain in the United States, the 4,421-metrehigh Mount Whitney in east-central California | on the border of the Sequoia National Park, which Bierstadt first visited in 1863. The prolific Bierstadt made five further trips around the west, all of them sponsored by railroad companies that hoped to garner interest through artistic representations of the regions they served. It was said by one critic at the time that half of those heading out west had, whether they knew it or not, been encouraged to move by a Bierstadt painting.
Being made to feel small is not, in general, a pleasant experience. We bristle at being reduced in importance at the hands of a haughty waiter or indifferent colleague. We strive to assert ourselves among our acquaintances and boost our standing through achievement. Nevertheless, in the 18th century, the Anglo-irish philosopher Edmund Burke identified a different, more pleasant sensation of smallness that we might experience in front of the mighty manifestations of nature: glaciers, oceans, mountains, the night sky. Before an eternally snow-capped mountain, far from feeling humiliated at our minuteness, we might be enhanced and uplifted; we might no longer care so much about the competitive jostling in the cities; it might not be such a worry any more who was earning what and who had
been spoken of well at parties. Burke termed this redemptive sensation of smallness ‘the sublime’ and it was largely thanks to him that a new sublime-seeking tourism arose. People actively set out to find places that could reduce them in size in their own imaginations. Mountains and waterfalls that might have been ignored previously became a focus for tourists seeking solace from their unquenched ambitions and frustrated sense of importance.
Bierstadt’s painting is ostensibly of Mount Whitney, but it is at the same time about our feelings towards our brother-in-law and about a new Bay Area technology company we have read about in a breathless article. We need vast scenes and the places they depict more than ever, not just for our physical health, but to help us contain the impatient questions inside our tormented minds: a 10-million-year old mountain created by the pressures on the intermontane west has developed a critical role in dampening our unwarranted and poignant frenzy that we do not matter enough.</p>
