        <h3>¶ State Broadcasting</h3>
<p>Most modern states possess a nationally owned broadcaster – and most wonder what it is actually for. Typically the argument is that it should provide worthy but unpopular programming that the free market wouldn’t support.</p>
<p>But there’s another, more impressive, purpose they could have: to improve the psychology of the nation. A large, arguably even the largest, share of the issues undermining advanced nations are ‘psychological’ at their root; that is, they have to do with our minds, with our deeper patterns of thinking and feeling. These problems include family breakdown, domestic violence, poor parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, obesity, depression, chronic anxiety, delinquency and loneliness. Taken together, these issues directly – and indirectly – cost national governments a massive share of their annual national budgets. Currently, there is no easy way for governments to address any of these problems.</p>
<p>This is where the tantalising opportunity lies. Just within reach of most governments, available for no extra money, stands the most powerful lever imaginable: the state broadcaster. Broadcasting is the single most effective way of changing mentalities, dramatically more helpful than a book, leaflet or class. Revolutionaries have always known this; it’s why they have always driven their tanks to the TV station first.</p>
<p>In order to stand any chance of addressing national psychological ills, it is key to get into people’s minds on a huge scale, with charm and skill, at regular, repeated intervals. The challenge wouldn’t be (as now) to make the odd unpopular programme about important things, but to turn out consistently compelling work that points to the resolution of the most damaging patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>With enough creativity applied, public broadcasting could do more to cure the troubles of nations than the police force, social services and the drugs squad combined. A huge opportunity is at hand, waiting for the necessary political will, intellectual focus and creative talent to develop.</p>
