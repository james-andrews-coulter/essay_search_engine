        <h3>— Redemption</h3>
<p>In the olden days, the arduous task of forgiveness and redemption was given to God. We didn’t have to wrestle with our own ambivalence about letting someone off the hook or our resistance to mapping out paths to making a new start. The secular world makes it harder, but we must overcome our understandable hesitation in believing the promises and sweet words of sinners. We need to take the risk of trusting in the sincerity of those who might have hurt us – in the hope that they will do the same for us when the day comes.</p>
<p>We should never punish or scold without simultaneously offering some kind of path to redemption. No one should fail without being given a chance to atone. We should not hand out unlimited sentences (for prison or social stigmatisation), nor deny anyone the right to reform their characters and do better next year.</p>
<p>We need to do for one another the tasks that we previously entrusted only to angels on the day of judgement. We need to dare to practise divine love.</p>
