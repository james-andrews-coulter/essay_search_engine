            <h1>1. Self-Observation</h1>
<p>When I advocate self-observation people sometimes assume that it’s just another form of self-absorbed navel gazing. Self-observation is not self-obsession, however. On the contrary, it is a tool that enables us to become less self-absorbed, because it teaches us not to be taken over by obsessive thoughts and feelings. With self-observation we develop more internal clarity and can become more open to the emotional lives of those around us. This new receptiveness and understanding will greatly improve our lives and relationships.</p>
<p>Self-observation is an ancient practice and it has been called many different things. It was advocated by Buddha, Socrates, George Gurdjieff and Sigmund Freud among others. When we become practised self-observers we are less likely to trip ourselves up by acting out our hidden feelings, less likely to repeat self-sabotaging patterns and more likely to have compassion for ourselves and therefore for others.</p>
<p>The ability to observe and listen to feelings and bodily sensations is essential to staying sane. We need to be able to use our feelings but not be used by them. If we are our emotions, rather than an observer of them, we will veer into a chaotic state. If, on the other hand, we repress our feelings altogether, we can swing the other way, into rigidity. There is a difference between saying ‘I am angry’ and saying ‘I feel angry’. The first statement is a description that appears closed. The second is an acknowledgement of a feeling, and does not define the whole self. In the same way that it is useful to be able to separate ourselves from our feelings, it is also necessary to be able to observe our thoughts. Then we can notice the different kinds of thoughts we have, and can examine them, rather than be them. This allows us to notice which thoughts work well for us, and whether any of our internal mind chatter is self-defeating.</p>
<p>To help explain the theory, let’s look at this example: how a mother observes her infant in order to understand him or her. She mirrors back to the baby its expressions, its inner states and from what she observes she learns to understand its needs from moment to moment. Being observed, understood and met in this way is vital for the formation of our personality and, indeed, our survival. The practice of self-observation mirrors the way in which a mother observes and attunes to her baby. Self-observation is a method of re-parenting ourselves. When we self-observe it helps us to form and re-form.</p>
<p>It may help to think of our self-observing part as a distinct component of ourselves. It is self-accepting and non-judgemental. It acknowledges what is, not what should be, and does not assign values such as ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It notices emotions and thoughts but gives us space to decide how to act on them. It is the part of us that listens both to our emotions and our logic and is aware of sensory information.</p>
<p>To begin self-observing, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p>What am I feeling now?</p>
<p>What am I thinking now?</p>
<p>What am I doing at this moment?</p>
<p>How am I breathing?</p>
<p>These simple questions are important because when we have answered them, we are in a better position to proceed to the next question:</p>
<p>What do I want for myself in this new moment?3</p>
<p>You may have made instantaneous changes just by reading the questions. For example, when we bring our attention to our breathing we become aware of how we are inhibiting it, and while we remain aware of it we tend to breathe more slowly. Change happens, if it needs to, when we become aware of what we are, not when we try to become what we are not.</p>
<p>I call these questions the ‘Grounding Exercise’. If we do this, or something similar, at odd moments during the day and get into the habit of doing so, we can create a space for self-observation. Then if we are going off course we have the opportunity to re-direct ourselves.</p>
<p>When I did the Grounding Exercise myself yesterday, I noticed that, when I asked myself the questions, I felt dissatisfied. I found I was dreaming of replacing all my furniture. What was I doing? I was reading an interior-design magazine and I was breathing shallowly. After I had answered the first four questions I was in a better position to answer the last. What did I want for myself? What I wanted for myself, at that moment, was to exhale, put the magazine down and turn my attention to something different; and so I went for a swim to switch my focus.</p>
<p>Doing the Grounding Exercise helps us to place ourselves in our internal experience. People can be loosely put into two groups, those who externally reference and those who internally reference. Externally referenced people are more concerned with the impression they make on other people: What do I look like? What does this look like? Internally referenced people are more concerned with what something feels like: Do I like the feel of this or that better? Externally referenced people want to get it right for others (so they will be accepted, impress them or be envied by them) but internally referenced people want to get it right for themselves (so they feel comfortable with themselves).</p>
<p>I’m not saying that one way of self-referencing is always superior to the other but I do want to stress the desirability of increasing our awareness of how we reference ourselves, so that we can work out how we place ourselves on the internal–external scale. Too far on the externally referenced side and we lose a sense of ourselves and become off-balance. If, on the other hand, we swing too far the other way, towards internally referencing, we may find it necessary to adapt to society a little more, in order to be a part of it. We can ask ourselves whether the way we manage our emotions is prompted by what we imagine other people are thinking about us, or by what we know will make us feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example: two people are sailing in identical boats. One is fantasizing, ‘Look at me in my fabulous yacht; I bet everyone thinks I look cool and envies me’, while the other is simply enjoying mastering the skill of sailing, feeling the breeze on his face and noticing the feelings that the open seas evoke in him. Two people doing the same thing but enjoying themselves in quite different ways. Many of us are a mixture of these two types; but if we often feel dissatisfied with life, it can be useful to understand how we are referencing ourselves; this in turn will allow us to experiment with change.</p>
<p>Internal or external referencing is one of the things to hold in mind while doing the Grounding Exercise. The Grounding Exercise is about finding out how we are functioning at any one moment. We can adapt the exercise for ourselves. For example, when I do the exercise I check how much tension I am holding in my shoulders, giving myself the opportunity to notice if I am tense, so I can loosen up if necessary.</p>
<p>When I am practising self-observation I also take time to notice what I call post-rationalization, which could also be called self-justification. This describes the way we have of mentally ‘tidying up’ what is going on inside and outside of ourselves, often coming up with convenient explanations which may actually be nonsense, to justify our behaviour.</p>
<p>Experiments carried out by the neuropsychologist Roger Sperry have thrown into question the notion that we are rational beings led by our reason and intellect. In the 1960s, Sperry and his colleagues carried out some experiments on people who had had the connective tissue (called the corpus callosum) between the right and left hemispheres of their brain cut, in order to treat severe epilepsy. That meant the two sides of their brains could no longer connect or interact.</p>
<p>When the experimenters flashed the command ‘WALK’ into the visual field of the subject’s right brain (bypassing the left brain completely) the subject got up and walked as directed. When asked why they walked, a question to which the left brain (responsible for language, reasons, labels and explanations) responded, they never said ‘Because your sign told me to’ or ‘I don’t know, I just felt an inexplicable urge to do so’, which would have been the truth (as the action was triggered by their emotional right brains). Instead, they invariably said something like ‘I wanted to get a drink of water’ or ‘I wanted to stretch my legs’. In other words, their rational left brain made sense of their action in a way that bore no relation to the real reason for it.</p>
<p>Considering this alongside further experiments that have been done on left-brain, right-brain splits4 we have no reason to think that the patient’s left hemisphere is behaving any differently from our own, as we make sense of the inclinations coming from our right brain. In other words, our ‘reasons’ for doing anything could be a post-rationalization, even when our corpus callosum has not been cut.</p>
<p>Even after our left brains have developed to give us the powers of language and logic, reasoning and mathematics, we continue to be ruled by the mammalian right brain. It turns out that we are unable to make any decision without our emotions. The neurologist Antonio Damasio had a patient called Elliot who, after an operation to remove a brain tumour, was unable to feel. His IQ remained excellent but he had no feelings even when shown terrible pictures of human suffering. We might think that, with his reasoning intact, Elliot could still decide where to go for lunch or what to invest his money in, but he was unable to make these decisions. He could imagine the probable outcomes of his choices, he could calmly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, but he could not come to a decision. Damasio wrote up his findings about Elliot and other patients like him in his book Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain. This book concluded that, contrary to our expectations, a lack of emotion does not lead to logical, reasoned choices but to chaos. This is because we rely on feelings to navigate our way through our lives. This is true whether or not we are aware of our emotions.</p>
<p>In order to understand our motivation better, it can be helpful to spend more time with our feelings, which is where self-observation comes in. We will not be able to fathom all our feelings; and we should not cling to the reasons we so speedily come up with – some of these may only be a mechanism for self-soothing or justifying what the right brain has already decided upon. Instead we can increase our tolerance for uncertainty, nurture our curiosity and continue to learn. There is a danger when we prematurely reach a judgement about something that we stop ourselves from learning anything further about it. I do not advocate dithering about everyday decisions (such as what to have for lunch), but the re-examination of our beliefs and opinions from time to time is beneficial. As the psychoanalyst Peter Lomas suggested, ‘Hold your beliefs lightly.’ Certainty is not necessarily a friend of sanity, although it is often mistaken for it.</p>
<p>We live in a so-called ‘age of reason’, and yet, research such as Sperry’s and Damasio’s demonstrates, many of our ideas, feelings and actions come from the right brain, while the left brain makes up reasons for those ideas, feelings and actions retrospectively. Every war might only be the playing out of an old dispute that happened in the nursery, for which the leader concerned is still trying to find a resolution.5 A lone gunman’s killing spree results from a lack of empathy for others, more than from his particular ideology.6 ‘Ideology’ is merely the reason he applies to his feelings – of, say, bitterness or hatred. When we argue vehemently against something, we do so not on account of the reasons we generate, but on account of the feelings that the reasons are created to support. They may be the ‘wrong’ reasons but our feeling is never the wrong feeling – our feelings just are. A feeling cannot be ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It is how we act out our feelings that is moral or immoral. A feeling on its own is no more right or wrong than a needle on a gauge, pointing to how much fuel you have in your tank. We might feel like annihilating someone but it is only the acting out of that feeling that is indicative of dubious morality.</p>
<p>A psychotherapist once told me when he was training that, previously, he had been sure that all his angry feelings were brought forth by the person in front of him, but as he learnt more about the psyche in general – and his in particular – he changed from pointing the finger and saying ‘You, you, you’; instead the finger went round in a circle until he was pointing at himself, and saying far more quietly, ‘Me, me, me’. As I have said, self-observation is the very opposite of self-indulgence. It makes self-responsibility possible.</p>
<p>Our post-rationalizing capacity – or what I am calling the left brain – means that we may come up with reasons not to self-examine. So if you decide to skip the self-observation exercises in this book, try to be more interested in the feelings that dictate that behaviour than in the reasons you apply to those feelings. You are being ‘run’ by those feelings, so rather than brush them off with your left brain, spend some time exploring them.</p>
<p>A psychotherapist is practised in hunting down the feelings behind justifications and fixed patterns of behaving and helping his or her client to see them. If you have the inclination and means, I recommend psychotherapy or psychoanalysis as a way of discovering more about the unconscious and how we integrate the unconscious with our logical side. However, it can be difficult to find the right therapist, and therapy tends to cost a good deal. There are other means and exercises that can help us develop the art of self-observation. There isn’t a right way to practise self-observation because one size does not fit all. I am an advocate of using whatever works. But however we get there, I believe that being able to self-observe is an essential part of staying sane. As well as using a focused attention technique like the Grounding Exercise, regularly keeping a journal can be a useful tool to aid self-observation.</p>
<p>A study in which half the participants kept a diary and half did not demonstrated the positive effects of writing something down about yourself each day. Diarists reported better moods and fewer moments of distress than non-diarists.</p>
<p>Those, in the same study, who kept a journal following trauma or bereavement also reported fewer flashbacks, nightmares and unexpected difficult memories. Writing can itself be an act of emotional processing so it can help in many situations of danger, extremity and loss of control. People who keep diaries are admitted to hospital less often and spend fewer days there than those who do not. Research shows that liver function and blood pressure are improved in diarists. All personality types are shown to benefit from keeping a diary. I am particularly fascinated by the way that diary-keeping has been shown to positively affect several aspects of the immune system – including T-cell growth7 and certain antibody responses. Studies have also shown that people who regularly keep daily ‘gratitude’ diaries, in which they list things for which they are grateful, report increased satisfaction with their lives and relationships.8 However, these benefits are not the main reasons I recommend diary-keeping. I’m keen on it because it is a useful tool for developing self-observation.</p>
<p>A few hints for starting a diary: be honest and keep it simple; it is just for you. Try not to start with a flourish and then tail off after a few days: persevere! What you write is up to you. I am a fan of random memories, as well as what you are thinking and feeling at the moment of writing. I also like dreams. Dreams fascinate therapists because they dramatize experiences and parts of our psyches that we may not have processed into language. I recommend writing down your dreams and your reactions to them in your diary.</p>
<p>If you cannot think what to write just keep writing to see what emerges. In fact, stream-of-consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning just after waking, has been found to be effective in raising self-awareness. Write in long-hand, and record anything and everything that comes into your head for a couple of sheets of paper.9</p>
<p>If you read your diary back to yourself you may identify some of your behavioural and emotional habits. For example, can you spot how much justification or reasoning you are using, or how much compassion you show yourself, or how much of what you write is fantasy?</p>
<p>Whatever method you find works best, keeping a diary is a way of processing your feelings, and getting to know yourself better.</p>
<p>Learning and practising focused attention is a key tool in the development of self-observation.</p>
<p>Focused attention improves our ability to observe and experience body and mind in the present and without criticism. There are many names for this practice: prayer, meditation, contemplative practice and self-directed neuroplasticity. Learning to focus our attention is also a key part of the practice of mindfulness. This focusing of the individual’s attention is a feature of many cultures and religions. Rituals as apparently different as Christian prayer and Sufi whirling are both forms of focused attention, but we can practise it whether we believe in a god or not. Practising focused attention boosts our concentration, helps with stress, anxiety, depression and addictive behaviours, and can even have a positive effect on physical problems like hypertension, heart disease and chronic pain.10</p>
<p>The practice of focused attention has further benefits. Studies have shown that the brains of those who regularly meditate or practise similar behaviours show permanent, beneficial changes. New neural pathways and connections proliferate. The pre-frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain associated with concentration, measurably thickens. The insula, the part of the brain that tracks the interior state of the body, as well as the emotional states of other people, also grows. Thus the practice of focusing attention for the purpose of self-observation literally strengthens and grows the brain. That in turn makes us more self-aware and thus better able to soothe ourselves, and it also means that we are able to empathize better with others. Practising self-observation helps to keep our brains flexible. Using it, we can become more aware of mental processes, without being taken over by those processes. It allows us to develop emotional resilience without repressing or denying our feelings. You’ll find some exercises for promoting focused attention and self-observation in the exercise section in the back of this book.</p>
<p>One of the things we become more aware of when we develop self-observation is what I call ‘toxic chatter’. Our heads are always full of chatter, littered with phrases, images, repeated messages, running commentaries on our actions and thoughts. Much may be harmless, but some can be toxic: hateful thoughts about ourselves or others; unconstructive self-scoldings; pointless pessimism. These types of thoughts can go round in circles; they get us nowhere and can cause depression. Self-observation allows us to impartially notice our mind-chatter and distance ourselves from that which is toxic. In this way the neural pathways that promote toxicity will be used less and will gradually shrink, while those that promote awareness and empathy will grow.</p>
<p>Using self-observation we can give ourselves the same sort of close attention that good parents give their children. As we saw earlier, such mirroring is the way children learn who they are and how to acknowledge, soothe and regulate themselves. Throughout our lives we have a desire and a need to be acknowledged and understood. Although this is most productively achieved in conjunction with another person, contemplative practice is one way we can achieve this on our own.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of ways we can develop self-observation. We may choose one-to-one therapy with a psycho-therapist, analyst or other practitioner, or join a therapy or yoga group. One of my biggest increases in self-awareness came when I trained for and completed the London Marathon. Using focused attention techniques such as meditating whilst running as part of a transformative physical project, I improved my concentration, self-confidence and self-awareness more than I could have imagined when I began training a year before the event.</p>
<p>In conclusion, practising self-observation can give us more insight into the emotions that play such a large part in our behaviour. When we become more sensitive towards ourselves and more knowledgeable about our own feelings, we are more able to attune to, and empathize with, the feelings of other people. In short, self-awareness improves our relationships. Relationships are the second cornerstone of our sanity, and we will now look at their role and importance.</p>
