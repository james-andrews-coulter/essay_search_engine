        <h2>THE IMPERFECTION OF THE OTHER</h2>
<p>It sounds deeply unromantic – especially in the lead-up to a wedding – to devote sustained attention to the flaws of one’s partner. At this stage we’re supposed to be entranced by all that is admirable about a future spouse. Yet getting a clear-eyed and penetrating view of the failings of the person one shares one’s life with is perhaps the kindest and most love-sustaining thing we can do. This is because the success or failure of a relationship doesn’t hinge on whether another person is flawed: they definitely are. What matters is how we interpret their failings; how we understand the reasons why they have in the past been and will in the future be very difficult to be with. The crux is whether we can move from interpreting their annoying sides as signs that they are mean or mad to viewing them as symptoms of pain and anxiety. We will have learnt to love when our default response to unfortunate behaviour is not to feel aggrieved that our right to happiness is under threat but to wonder what aspects of a partner’s damaged past have been engaged.</p>
<p>At our more fragile moments, it is clear where our partner’s failings come from: wilful awfulness. They are the expression of an almost devilish desire to humiliate and distress us. If they’re less sexually intense than we’d like them to be, or too pushy around sex, or too messy, fussy, argumentative or lacking in interesting opinions, we interpret this as something they could easily change if they wanted to. It is just that they can’t be bothered; they’re being selfish and wilfully wrecking our chances of happiness.</p>
<p>But the truth is almost invariably very different. Our partner’s annoying characteristics have their roots in childhood, long before they met us. They emerged as strategies for coping with the stresses of their early years. Perhaps an over-critical, demanding mother made them feel as if being a bit disorganised and untidy was a necessary rebellion: a crucial assertion of independence that left them with an enduring sense that hanging up their clothes neatly or keeping the kitchen surfaces pristine could be of interest only to a tyrant. Their behaviour today may be exasperating, but they’re not evil: they’re just playing out the legacy of a difficult aspect of their lives when they were little.</p>
<p>Maybe they grew up in a family that didn’t feel socially secure: now they are keen to spend as much money as possible; they have a tendency to show off; they’re overly impressed by people you don’t much admire; they want to go to parties all the time and make a fuss if they don’t think you look smart enough. The surface behaviour gets to you, but this flaw can be more charitably seen as an attempt to compensate for what they experienced as the humiliations of their upbringing. They may never properly admit this to you, but instead of merely hating this side of their character, you can understand it and partly forgive it in the light of its origins. They are not simply a bit snobbish; they are attempting (as best they can) to escape certain past miseries.</p>
<p>A partner’s less appealing sides can almost always be understood as responses to background fears and worries. If they seem lazy, it could be because their deep love of perfection leaves them terrified of making a mistake. If they are sulky, it may be because they fear they cannot make themselves properly understood. If they are short-tempered, this could be due to worries about failure at work, driven on by the ghostly presence of a disapproving father.</p>
<p>Any unpleasing action can be given a more or less charitable interpretation. And odd though it sounds at first, the charitable interpretation is usually right. We instantly recognise this when it comes to ourselves. We know how our own less endearing qualities deserve to be seen not as an expression of our deep nastiness but as responses to fear and anxiety. We know ourselves to be more deserving of pity than condemnation. And since this is true of us, it is very likely to be true of our partner too.</p>
<p>As we embark on marriage, we should accept that we’re not going to start liking our partner’s worse aspects – and nor should we expect to. We should acknowledge that they almost certainly won’t change much. Neither of these points should be decisive. We are ideally ready for marriage not when we have encountered perfection or achieved a sage-like calm, just when we’re willing – in our less pressured moments – to give a charitable interpretation to our partner’s many failings.</p>
<p>It’s helpful, though strange, to become more explicit. We could usefully draw up in our minds a list of the seven most annoying things about our partners. Some might seem embarrassingly trivial; some very substantial. The task is not mean or inappropriate. We’re not trying to condemn our partners per se but rather to lay the groundwork for love.</p>
<p>We then need to try to imagine the kindest, most charitable explanation for these annoying characteristics. What things in their past might explain this very tricky habit or obsession or disproportionate, exaggerated worry of theirs? How could a lovely person, under dynamics they didn’t ask for, end up being like that? We’re imaginatively rehearsing the crucial move from an irate interpretation – which sees a defect as a sign that a person is stupid, mean, heartless or cruel – to a benign, kindly, loving one that sees them as suffering from a past misfortune. Their annoying conduct or mentality doesn’t show that they are evil (as we will always think at our most frayed moments); simply that they are labouring with a difficulty that might deserve compassion.</p>
<p>A charitable interpretation of defects in one’s partner doesn’t make it lovely to be confronted with their troubles. We are still with someone who thwarts us, is over-critical, clingy or cold, or has a touch of the snob about them. But we’re set to be less disgusted and less panicked in the face of these ills. We’re strengthening our capacity to stick with them, because we see that their failings don’t make them unworthy of love; indeed, they render them all the more urgently in need of it.</p>
<p>Part of this involves overcoming the haunting feeling that we’d be better off with someone else. After we have been together with someone for a while, a lot of new people will appear to be exciting and kind. We may occasionally meet an example who seems distinctly nicer: they are warmer or funnier or better-looking; a better listener or more interested in the things that fascinate us. The comparison at once casts our partner in a distinctly unflattering light. Why on earth are we contemplating a lifetime with someone so flawed?</p>
<p>Our partners aren’t uniquely damaged. We just know them much better than the exciting stranger. Our partner suffers from the disadvantages of incumbency; of having been in our lives for so long that we have seen the full range of their inadequacies. Our certainty that we might be happier with another person is founded on ignorance. It is the result of having been shielded from the worst and more crazy dimensions of a new character’s personality, which we must accept will be there – not because we know them in any detail, but because we know the human race, of which (despite their exceptionally pleasing looks and manner) they remain a part.</p>
