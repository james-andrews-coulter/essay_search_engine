        <h2>Palmyra</h2>
<p>If we ever needed reasons to give up on the human race, we could do worse than begin with the 14th May 2015, the date when soldiers belonging to the Islamic State supposedly driven by a desire to set up a caliphate, but in reality suffering from a particular kind of mental illness overran Syrian government forces and took hold of the archaeological site of Palmyra, in south-central Syria, 210 kilometres northeast of Damascus.
The city had once, long ago, been one of the most elegant and powerful in the world. At its zenith in the 3rd century CE, it was known for its colonnades, its theatres, its solid granite public baths, its bronze statues of local aristocrats and gods and its military prowess under the Palmyrene King Odaenathus (who invaded Egypt and routed the armies of the Persian Emperor Shapur |). Palmyra endured far longer than the American Empire; it thrived for many centuries more than modern Manhattan. Then, gradually, the trade routes on which it depended shifted course and it fell into decline, until it was finally wrecked in the early 15th century by a marauding tribe from Uzbekistan.
Palmyra did not disappear from the map, however. It became a famous archaeological site, attracting European visitors who enjoyed its melancholy atmosphere, sketched the remains of its temples and wrote poems to its past glories. A museum was set up to house a considerable collection of deities, statues and funerary monuments.
Though the place was already a ruin, it was not ruined enough for the tastes of the soldiers of the Islamic State. They wanted to finish off what the marauding Uzbek tribe had begun. So they tracked down the chief archaeologist, Khaled al-Asaad, a gentle and learned man with a worldwide reputation in his field and many books to his name and who had been in charge of the site for the previous
thirty years. They asked him for a full tour, took a careful note of where everything was and then, though a distraught Khaled begged them to stop, blew up the statue of the Lion of Al-lat, fired mortars into the 1st-century Temple of Baalshamin and the Monumental Arch, dynamited the Temple of Bel, destroyed the 2nd-century Tower of Elahbel, pulverised the ancient tombs of lamliku and Atenaten, ransacked the museum, smashed every display case and desecrated every female statue they could find then, having made sure he had seen all their handiwork, they cut Khaled’s head off with a sword and hung his body feet first from a column in the main avenue.
Palmyra is now one of the saddest places in the world. It’s where we should come to properly despair of who we are. It’s no longer telling us the story of an ancient Semitic city. It’s a monument to the madness in each of us. Despite our sentimental stories, despite how sweet we can be when we look after small children, despite our shiny spaceships and impressive phones, we belong to one of the most murderous, cruel, savage and pitiless life forms that have ever dwelt on the earth. With Palmyra’s example, it may be best to settle this matter of our worth once and for all; thereafter, a lot less will still have the power to surprise and appall us.</p>
