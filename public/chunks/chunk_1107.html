        <h4>DO YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME?</h4>
<p>We hear so much about the tensions and difficulties of asking someone to be our lover, but so little of the challenges of asking someone to be our friend – an equally or arguably even more important request.</p>
<p>→It was truly such a pleasure to meet and talk.</p>
<p>Imagine there’s someone you’ve quite recently met who you really rather liked – though not in any romantic sense. It might be hard to state precisely the allure; maybe you were drawn to their sense of mischief or perhaps they said something wise or touching; they might have very neatly defused a potentially tricky social situation or you liked the way they narrowed their eyelids when they were thinking. None of which you could directly say. But you could certainly hint.</p>
<p>→I’m still laughing about [the story of the dancing dog and the bicycle or of your mother’s hat at the wedding] or thinking about [your thoughts on social energy or the atmosphere on Sunday evenings]. I meet so many people, but properly see eye to eye with so few.</p>
<p>The internal hurdle we may have to overcome is a sense that there is something wrong with us for wanting a new friend. Outside of a few well-established periods – starting college, or on relocating to a new city – it’s not readily assumed that decent people might be on the lookout for additions to their social circle. The natural assumption is that if one is remotely interesting, funny, thoughtful or kind, one will already have all the friends one could possibly want. It’s hard for us to keep in mind the implausible notion that a person might be both very nice and rather lonely.</p>
<p>→I wonder if you might want to go out for a meal again at some point.</p>
<p>The possibility of friendship often stalls because both sides are privately waiting for a sign from the other one as to whether or not they are liked; no one wants to make the first move. Under pressure, we forget the fundamental malleability within the question of whether someone wants to be friends with us or not; in reality, most of it depends on how we behave towards them. Most of us like people who like us; it can be that simple. If we have a little courage and can keep our deep suspicions of ourselves and our terror of their rejection of us at bay, we have every opportunity to turn the situation in our direction.</p>
<p>→I really liked what you were saying at the end of the evening – and I’m wondering if you could maybe give me a bit of advice; I’m keen to get past a certain mental block I have.</p>
<p>We might assume that what would make us appealing to someone we like is an aura of being problem-free. However, within reason, offering another person a glimpse of one of our difficulties can be a generous and welcome act, lending them a chance to experience their own competence and intelligence.</p>
<p>→There’s one thing in particular I’d love to talk to you about...</p>
<p>One of the challenges around establishing a new friendship is that of defining in your own head what the friendship is for. The idea that a friendship might have a theme isn’t inherently strange but we usually apply it only in quite restricted areas; we understand that someone might be a great companion to go hiking with or an excellent golf partner. But we tend not to extend this useful notion into other potential areas: that we might, for instance, build a friendship around a shared interest in analysing our childhoods or evaluating a city’s architecture. There’s no shortage of people who are fairly nice; what truly justifies a new friendship is the discovery of delicate and unusual strands of shared perceptions and interests. The sooner we get these clear in our own minds, the more crisply we can hint at what can sustain the union going forward.</p>
<p>→Perhaps you’d be free one night next week?</p>
