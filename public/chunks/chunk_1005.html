        <h2>THE SETTING</h2>
<p>i. Location</p>
<p>Ideally, the marriage ceremony should take place in a location radically distinct from everyday life, to emphasise its uniqueness and higher purpose. Architectural grandeur may help, as can the sublime aspects of nature. You probably shouldn’t select a holiday destination, which can suggest leisure, fun and a carefree state of mind. These are lovely, of course, but deeply at odds with what you are doing at a wedding: preparing to stick with someone through immense hardships.</p>
<p>What is vital is that the setting speaks of eternity; that it implies the smallness of our momentary concerns and encourages the mind to rise to the long term.</p>
<p>Lighting might usefully be subdued, suggesting how little we know ourselves or what we’re getting into. It should highlight the couple, leaving them dramatically conspicuous in front of the audience. During the ceremony, the couple should be on a slightly raised platform, together with the marriage director. They should be deeply conscious of being seen: this is not a private moment.</p>
<p>ii. Clothes</p>
<p>Your clothes must be very formal, so as to stress the distance between this occasion and the ordinary habits of daily life. This is not the moment to express your individuality – crucially, marriage requires the repression of certain aspects of your singularity for the sake of harmony. In the ceremony you are announcing your willingness to compromise, to adapt, to subordinate an intimate preference for the sake of what will work for your partner. A slightly anonymous suit or dress – such as might be worn by many others on their wedding day – indicates that you are ready to rein in your own desires. You might put on a cravat even if you feel it is a touch ridiculous, or a long gown, even though it’s ‘not you’. In much harder ways, you are going to have to repeat such acts of accommodation in the marriage as a whole.</p>
<p>iii. At what time of day should the ceremony take place?</p>
<p>The rationale for the time of day is not the expression of your nature. It should be a time that is convenient for other people, irrespective of whether or not it is convenient for you. If you feel that it is boring and conventional to get married at 3pm on a Saturday, that’s probably a very good time to select. If you usually laze about on the weekend, 11am on a Sunday could be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>iv. The guests</p>
<p>The guests are the public witnesses of your vows. Ideally, you’d feel deeply embarrassed to break your commitment to each other after so many people have seen and heard you making it. You don’t just need your close friends, because they will usually be indulgent to your failings. You need a relatively intimidating audience; people who have travelled a long way; people you are slightly in awe of; people whose good opinion is important to you; people who are a bit sceptical of you. You might ask along some senior people from work (especially if you are not personal friends with them); a teacher from your school days that you admired and for whom you wanted to do your best; a crotchety aunt or a forbiddingly impressive friend of your parents. The point is that you should feel uncomfortable at the prospect of quitting the relationship after having said, in front of them, that you never would.</p>
<p>There is a growing trend, often driven by financial concerns, towards slightly smaller weddings, but a big crowd is, in fact, supremely important (even if the budget only stretches to a sandwich for them later). One needs a maximum number of people so as to cause the greatest possible embarrassment in years to come at the idea of having to call them all up and announce news of divorce. The larger the crowd, the slower one will be to pick up the phone. This gives due recognition to an important fact about marriage: it is a social institution, in which we often stay for reasons that go far beyond our own emotional desires. It involves us, but it’s not just about us. It is about the dog, the children, the grandparents, the friends who got married in imitation of us and whose own relationships would suffer if we split. This sense that the marriage isn’t just about us should come as a huge source of relief: there is nothing harder than being required to be happy in and for ourselves. There is a huge benefit in knowing that we will, with time, be living for others and that our own frame of mind won’t always be the point.</p>
<p>v. The marriage director</p>
<p>The marriage director is the person who conducts the ceremony. Their role is to be an ambassador for noumenal time; for the idea that on this day you are publicly making commitments and assertions that aim to speak for the whole of your life. What you say at the ceremony will be relevant in ten or twenty years. Should you have children, your words will matter across the span of their lives too.</p>
<p>In their comments and conversation, the director shouldn’t make reference to current events; they shouldn’t make topical jokes; they shouldn’t try to lighten the mood. They shouldn’t be jolly or especially cheerful. Ideally, they will have a careful, sober and calm demeanour: they know that what you are doing is difficult and will at times seem too difficult. They know there will be rages and sulks; there will be bitter rows late at night, tears, accusations, cold looks, snide comments, intransigence, maddening disappointments and long-festering hurts on both sides. They are not cynical or weary: they believe deeply in the value of marriage, not because it is lovely (they know it isn’t) but because its sorrows and pains are connected to a magnificent attempt to love another person and to become a properly mature version of oneself. When they ask you if you are willing to marry this person, they know full well what they are asking for – and they want to be sure you know it too. They will have something of the gravity and kindness of a radiologist who thinks you can be cured, but knows you face a lengthy and grim sequence of treatments. They are filled with pity and tenderness. They are not pretending it’s going to be nice, but they are sure you should go ahead.</p>
<p>A central task of the marriage director is to get the audience to feel the gravity of the moment. Many present will be married or have been married or will get married one day. They will all know (in their own way) what marriage is really like, and the director has to summon the truth to the front of their minds – just as at a funeral, the covert central fact is that everyone has death to deal with, not simply the person laid out in the coffin.</p>
<p>The director’s appearance should signal their attitude: they should wear elegant but serious black clothes and formal, highly polished and solemn shoes.</p>
<p>vi. Music</p>
<p>Music plays an important role across the ceremony. It is the most effective mechanism for creating a mood; for getting us into a state in which certain kinds of thoughts and feelings more easily enter our minds. What matters isn't so much the exact pieces that are chosen as the outlook they support and encourage. We here define the mood the music should create rather than seeking to name specific songs or pieces.</p>
