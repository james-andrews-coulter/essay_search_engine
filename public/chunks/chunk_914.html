        <h2>Loving and Being Loved</h2>
<p>We speak of ‘love’ as if it were a single, undifferentiated thing, but in truth it comprises two very different modes: being loved and loving. Part of getting better at relationships means growing a little readier to do the latter and a little more aware of our unnatural and dangerous fixation on the former.</p>
<p>We start out knowing only about ‘being loved’. That’s how it was when we were infants and others ministered to us. In our early years, we could do nothing but receive love; someone was on hand to comfort us, to play with us, to ask us how we were feeling and to attempt as hard as they could to soothe our worries. For our part, we had to do very little in return. It wasn’t our role to ask the parent how their day was or to suggest that, given how tired they were, they might like to go upstairs for a nap.</p>
<p>This style of relating to someone (with the other as our guide, helper and servant) can (without anyone wishing anyone else ill) naturally come to seem the norm of what love should be. To the child, it just feels as if the parent were spontaneously on hand to comfort, guide, entertain, feed and clear up, while remaining almost constantly warm and cheerful. And parents do their utmost to hide that there might be an alternative reality. They strive to suppress their moments of rage, despair and indifference.</p>
<p>We take this lopsided view of love with us into adulthood. Our first (entirely unconscious) move – when we reach our teenage years – is to hope for a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be ministered to and indulged as a child. In a secret corner of our mind, we picture a lover who will anticipate our needs, read our hearts, act selflessly and make our world better and more complete. It sounds ‘Romantic’, and yet it turns out to be a blueprint for trouble and disaster if we insist on it too fervently.</p>
<p>Perhaps you never had such a figure in your life, but let’s imagine for a moment what a good mother might have been like: when you were a baby, she fed you in the night; you cried at 3am and she got up to comfort you until you eventually found your way back to sleep an hour later. When you had a cold, she brought you egg and soldiers in bed. She was very interested in small things about you, like how you did in the school geography exam or the graze you got on your knee in the running race. Nowadays, she wants you to be happy; professional success isn’t the point. And when you mess up, your troubles are hers. She will put her own needs aside for you. She won’t demand that you take her difficulties as seriously as she takes yours.</p>
<p>It’s an extraordinary image of what love could be. And as adults, we can be forgiven for first demanding this sort of love from one another. However, we are likely to make a bitter discovery in the process: that we cannot now seem to locate an approximation of the love we knew as children.</p>
<p>We may rage against this and blame the other person for their inability to perfectly intuit our needs and love us enough, until the day we reach a true maturity, realising that the only release from our longing for this sort of selfless one-directional love is to stop demanding it exclusively for ourselves and to learn – at times, when we have the energy and imagination – to give it to somebody else, to learn to make the same moves for our lover as an ideal parent once made for us. We won’t manage it all the time, and nor should we be expected to. Adult love can only ever be a judicious blend of a request for, and an offer of, help. Yet it is not uncommon for a couple to seem like two small children who have been left alone in the nursery and are both wailing that they have been ignored, neither of them able to step into the adult role for long enough to build up the other – and then see their efforts returned. We should recognise how often relationships legitimately require us to put our own needs aside for a time in order to minister to another’s suffering. That is when we will have finally learned the tricky task of knowing how to love, rather than simply to be loved.</p>
