        <h2>ANGER AT OTHERS</h2>
<p>We may likewise need to feel a past fury that has grown cold and congealed inside us. Small children tend never to blame those who have harmed them. They depend on them far too much to dare to question their authority. They turn the hurt in on themselves: they wonder, for example, why they aren’t good enough, rather than wondering what business an adult has in humiliating and crushing the spirit of a four-year-old. The intervention of a therapist can bring an earlier cruelty and illogicality to light and therefore permits some of the anger to be redirected from the self—where it might have been the source of depression and suicidal longings—back toward its true target. No longer needing to worry about retribution from an overbearing or fragile parent and assured of the justice of our feelings, we can take the risk of being, for a time, as angry as our mental health requires.</p>
