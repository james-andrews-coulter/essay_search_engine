        <h2>THE ENDURING POINT OF MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>Many of us find it ever harder to know what the point of marriage might be. The drawbacks are evident and well charted. Marriage is a state-sanctioned legal construct, fundamentally linked to matters of property, progeny and pension entitlements – a construct that aims to restrict and control how two people might feel towards one another over fifty or more years. It places a cold, unhelpful, expensive and emotionally alien frame around what will always be a private matter of the heart. We don’t need a marriage certificate to show affection and admiration. Indeed, forcing commitment only increases the danger of eventual inauthenticity and dishonesty. If love doesn’t work out, being married simply makes it much harder to disentangle two lives and prolongs the agony of a dysfunctional union. Love either works or it doesn’t; marriage doesn’t help matters one iota either way. It is completely reasonable to suppose that the mature, modern and logical move is to sidestep marriage entirely, along with the obvious nonsense of a wedding.</p>
<p>It would be hopeless to try to defend marriage on the grounds of its convenience. It is clearly cumbersome, expensive, risky and, at junctures, wholly archaic. But that is the point. The whole rationale of marriage is to function as a prison that it is very hard and very embarrassing for two people to get out of.</p>
<p>The essence of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate our wills, to put high and costly obstacles in the way of splitting up, and sometimes to force two unhappy people to stay in each other’s company for longer than either of them would wish. Why do we do this?</p>
<p>Originally, we told ourselves that God wanted us to stay married. But even now, when God looms less large in the argument, we keep making sure that marriage is hard to undo. For one thing, we carefully invite everyone we know to watch us proclaim that we will stick together. We deliberately invite an elderly aunt or uncle who we don’t even like that much to fly around the world to be there. We willingly create a huge layer of embarrassment were we ever to turn round and admit it might have been a mistake. Furthermore, even though we could keep things separate, marriage tends to mean deep economic and legal entanglements. We know it would take a phalanx of accountants and lawyers to prise us apart. It can be done, of course, but it would be ruinous.</p>
<p>It is as if we recognise that there might be some quite good, though strange-sounding, reasons to make it hard to get out of a public lifelong commitment to someone else.</p>
<p>i. Impulse is dangerous</p>
<p>The Marshmallow Test was a celebrated experiment in the history of psychology designed to measure children’s ability to delay gratification and track the consequences of being able to think long-term. Some three-year-olds were offered a marshmallow, but were told they would get two if they held off from eating the first one for five minutes. It turned out a lot of children couldn’t make it through this period. The immediate benefit of gobbling the single marshmallow in front of them was stronger than the strategy of waiting for the larger reward. Crucially, it was observed that these children went on to have lives blighted by a lack of impulse control, and fared much worse than the children who were best at subordinating immediate fun for long-term benefit.</p>
<p>Relationships are no different. Here too, many things feel urgent. Not eating marshmallows, but escaping, finding freedom, running away, possibly with the new office recruit…. Sometimes, we are angry and we want to get out very badly. We are excited by a stranger and want to abandon our present partner at once. And yet, as we look around for the exit, every way seems blocked. It would cost a fortune; it would be embarrassing; it would take an age.</p>
<p>Marriage is a giant inhibitor of impulse set up by our conscience to keep our libidinous, naive, desiring selves in check. What we are essentially buying into by submitting to its dictates is the insight that we are (as individuals) likely to make poor choices under the sway of strong short-term impulses. To marry is to recognise that we require structure to insulate ourselves from our urges. It is to lock ourselves up willingly, because we acknowledge the benefits of the long term; the wisdom of the morning after the storm.</p>
<p>Marriage proceeds without constant reference to the moods of its protagonists. It isn’t about feeling. It is a declaration of intent that is crucially impervious to our day-to-day desires. It is a very unusual marriage in which two people don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasising that they weren’t in fact married. But the point of marriage is to make these feelings not matter very much. It is an arrangement that protects us from what we desire and yet know (in our more reasonable moments) that we don’t truly need or want.</p>
<p>ii. We grow and develop gradually</p>
<p>At their best, relationships involve us in attempts to develop, mature and become ‘whole’. We are often drawn to people precisely because they promise to edge us in the right direction.</p>
<p>But the process of our maturation can be agonisingly slow and complicated. We spend long periods (decades, perhaps) blaming the other person for problems that arise from our own weaknesses. We resist attempts at being changed, naively asking to be loved ‘for who we are’.</p>
<p>It can take years of supportive interest, many tearful moments of anxiety and much frustration before genuine progress is made. With time, after maybe 120 arguments on a single topic, each party may begin to see it from the other’s point of view. Slowly we start to gain insights into our own madness. We find labels for our issues; we give each other maps of our difficult areas; we become a little easier to live with.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lessons that are most important for us – the lessons that most contribute to our increasing wisdom and rounded completeness as people – are almost always the most painful to learn. They involve confronting our fears, dismantling our defensive armour, feeling properly guilty about our capacity to hurt another, being genuinely sorry for our faults, and learning to put up with someone else’s imperfections.</p>
<p>It is too easy to seem kind and normal when we keep starting new relationships. The truth about us, on the basis of which self-improvement can begin, only becomes clear over time. Chances of development can increase hugely when we stay put and don’t succumb to the temptation to run away to people who will falsely reassure us that there’s nothing too wrong with us.</p>
<p>iii. Investment requires security</p>
<p>Many of the most worthwhile projects require immense sacrifices from both parties, and it’s in the nature of such sacrifices that we are most likely to make them for people who are also making them for us.</p>
<p>Marriage is a means by which people can specialise – perhaps in making money or in running a home. This can be hugely constructive. But it carries a risk. Each person (especially if one person stays at home) needs to be assured that they will not later be disadvantaged by their devotion.</p>
<p>Marriage sets up the conditions in which we can take valuable decisions about what to do with our lives that would be too risky outside of its guarantees.</p>
<hr />
<p>Over time, the argument for marriage has shifted. It is no longer about external forces having power over us: churches, the state, the legal idea of legitimacy, the social idea of being respectable….</p>
<p>What we correctly focus on now is the psychological point of making it hard to throw it all in. It turns out that we benefit greatly (though at a price) from having to stick with certain commitments, because some of our key needs have a long-term structure.</p>
<p>For the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has been on attempting to make separation easier. The challenge now lies in another direction: in trying to remind ourselves why immediate flight doesn’t always make sense; in trying to see the point of holding out for the second marshmallow.</p>
<p>Tethering ourselves to our partner, via the public institution of marriage, gives our unavoidable fluctuations of feeling less power to destroy a relationship; one that we know, in calmer moments, is supremely important to us. The point of marriage is to be usefully unpleasant – at least at crucial times. Together we embrace a set of limitations on one kind of freedom – the freedom to run away – so as to protect and strengthen another kind of freedom: a shared ability to mature and create something of lasting value, one whose pains are aligned to our better selves.</p>
