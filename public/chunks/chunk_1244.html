        <h2>Travelling in Memory</h2>
<p>We can suffer from an unfortunate and stubborn conviction that the only way to access the goodness of certain places is — on every new occasion — to take our bodies there; to buy a plane ticket, pack a suitcase and transport our material frame around the globe to reach what we need to see. It can’t be enough to have visited one beach at one point; we have to keep returning to a beach every time we want to savour what a beach can be. Its benefits are assumed to last as long, and only as long, as the trip itself. The moment our toes have left the sand, the experience must be over.</p>
<p>But this is to fail to appreciate how ingeniously built our minds are and, in particular, what awesome powers of memory and evocation we possess — even if we normally only use these very haphazardly and meekly. Our minds forget more or less nothing, down to minute details. Almost everything that we have ever experienced has been dutifully recorded and shelved somewhere in the vaults of our memories. It’s all still there: the smell of snow on the first day in the mountains of the Engadine, the taste of the vine leaves in the taverna near Rhodes, the sensation of a pair of childhood sandals, the tilework in the hotel in Aswan, the scent of roses in the garden in Ravenna. It’s only habit and inattention that prevent us from regularly accessing these memories and summoning them to consciousness to derive some of their original advantages. Nevertheless, at times they will press themselves on us anyway. As we try to fall asleep, a memory of a trip a decade before may suddenly — unbidden — enter our minds. A smell may trigger a cascade of impressions we had given up ever knowing again; an entire period of childhood can be summoned up by contact with a certain kind of biscuit, sunlight or texture of carpet.</p>
<p>The 19th-century American painter Frederic Edwin Church made two journeys to South America in his lifetime; to travel like this across continents was enormously expensive and dangerous. Most people never even left home. The trips were relatively short, but what counted was how assiduous Church later was in tending to the memories of what he had seen and felt. Throughout his life, he would return in his head to places he could not go back to in body. He completed dozens of pictures of the trip up to two decades after he had come home. Thanks to his imagination, he could be both in his farmhouse in the Hudson Valley and, simultaneously, in Brazil, experiencing — as if it were happening in front of him — the light rising on the Amazon in the early morning.</p>
<p>Not being in a place should never hold us back from immersing ourselves in what it once made us feel. It is unfairly heavy-handed of us to think that we need always to keep travelling with our entire cumbersome selves; we should open up a far larger role for trips via memory. We should sometimes let our imaginations do what they have been designed for.</p>
