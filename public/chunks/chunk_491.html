        <h2>Love as Generosity</h2>
<p>To fall in love with someone is typically assumed to involve awe at a person’s physical and psychological virtues. We think of ourselves as ‘in love’ when we are bewitched by a rare creature who seems in myriad ways stronger and more accomplished than we are; our love seems founded on admiration.</p>
<p>But there is another view of love that deserves to be explored; a philosophy of love founded on generosity. From this perspective, to love means not only or primarily to experience admiration in the face of perfection; it involves a capacity to be uncommonly generous towards a fellow human at moments when they may be less than straightforwardly appealing. Love is taken to mean not a thrill in the face of accomplishment, but a distinctive skill founded on the ability to see beyond a person’s off-putting outer dimensions, an energy to enter imaginatively into their experiences and bestow an ongoing degree of forgiveness and kindness in spite of marked trickiness and confusion.</p>
