        <h2>Phones</h2>
<p>Why do we pick up our phones so much? There are the standard, conventional-sounding answers: we check our phones to see if any messages might have come in, if someone posted an interesting video, if something dreadful has happened overseas.</p>
<p>But this is in danger of sounding far too normal and too kind to us. The truth is a lot darker and rather more humbling. We don’t pick up our phones to find out what’s going on, we pick them up to ensure – with considerable ruthlessness – that we are in no danger of finding out anything more about ourselves.</p>
<p>If we forensically study the moments when we are drawn to pick up our devices, these are almost always when some kind of anxiety is pressing in on us – an anxiety on whose analysis and interpretation the correct navigation of our lives may depend. We are using our devices as an alternative to thinking about our futures, we employ our machines to block insight, to halt the business of processing, to alienate our minds from their most promising and complex substrata.</p>
<p>The thoughts attempting to break into consciousness might be about our mother and the strange thing she said to us over lunch. Or about an unkind and sharp word our partner had with us this morning, which threatens to throw our relationship into question once again.</p>
<p>How convenient that we should have invented a device to ensure that we will never have to meet ourselves again, and how darkly ironic that we should blithely refer to it as, of all things, an instrument of communication.</p>
<p>We take pride in the time we’ve saved, the dictionaries we don’t have to consult, the atlases we can throw away, the many strange and funny things we have discovered. And yet we ignore the reveries we haven’t entertained, the ideas we’ve not hatched, the feelings we’ve not identified, the self-awareness we’ve lost.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t need to be the end of the story. Precisely when we most want to pick up our phones, we should learn to do something very unusual; pause and ask ourselves a bold question: if I wasn’t allowed to consult my phone right now, what might I need to think about?</p>
<p>The answer can provide us with nothing less than a royal road into our unexamined lives. Rather than using our phones to stop ourselves from thinking, we can study our craving for them as a guide to when and where we particularly need to introspect.</p>
