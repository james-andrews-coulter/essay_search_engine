        <h1>3. A Self-Observation Exercise to Do Whilst Working</h1>
<p>Try this: When you are next doing chores around the house – cooking, cleaning, washing, etc. – focus with complete awareness on what you are doing, mentally recording each feeling, thought, sensation or memory as it enters your head. For example, ‘Now I am washing a cup; I feel the warm water and soapy suds; now I’m putting the cup on the draining board and noticing the sound of one against the other; now I am thinking about the war in Afghanistan; now I am pulling the plug’, and so on. You might want to have a shower with complete awareness, or wash the kitchen floor, or eat a meal. This is a simple way to develop self-observation and concentrate on living in the moment.</p>
