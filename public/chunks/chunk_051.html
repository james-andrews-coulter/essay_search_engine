            <h3>¶ Emotional Education</h3>
<p>We accept a major role for education at the centre of our societies. We invest hugely in ensuring that knowledge painfully built up in one generation can be reliably transferred to another.</p>
<p>However, our Romantic culture places a curious limit around the idea of what can fairly be taught and transferred. We know that we can teach people how to fly a plane, perform brain surgery or analyse the tax returns of medium-sized businesses – and a host of institutions exist to carry out instruction in these fields.</p>
<p>However, it would sound distinctly odd, even eerie, to imagine that we might learn, for example, how to love someone, how to become wise, how to grow less agitated, or how to die well. Our Romantic culture assumes that in these fields, what we call the area of Emotional Intelligence, we are simply more or less born knowing how to live, and that there is precious little that one human could ever systematically teach another.</p>
<p>Emotional Education is the term given to the contrary belief that we can and must train ourselves in our emotional conduct. We should, its adherents propose, be schooled to respond in more equitable and intelligent ways to our impulses, desires and fears. Emotional Education proposes that emotions are not fixed, unchangeable or even reliable tendencies. We can learn how to be more forgiving; how to extend the range of our sympathies; how to grow more confident, accepting, patient and self-aware.</p>
<p>It is because we have – until now – not taken Emotional Education seriously enough that our species has grown ever more technically adept while retaining the level of wisdom of our earliest days, with catastrophic results. We are evolved monkeys with nuclear weapons. It appears that the fate of civilisation now depends on our capacity to master the mechanisms of Emotional Education before it is too late.</p>
<p>Emotional Education extends far beyond formal education as we have conceived of it to date. Although it should ideally include specialised courses in every year of school or college, Emotional Education is more than something that should take place in classrooms at the hands of teachers and come to a halt around the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>The central vehicle for the transfer of Emotional Intelligence is culture, from its highest to its most popular level. Culture is the field that can ritualise and consistently promote the absorption of wisdom. The ‘lessons’ of culture might be embedded in a tragedy or a TV series, a pop song or a novel, a work of architecture or a news bulletin. We can envisage the entire apparatus of culture as a subtle mechanism designed to point us towards greater wisdom.</p>
<p>We will never progress as a species, and will indeed grow into ever-greater technologically armed menaces to ourselves, until we have accepted the challenges and opportunities of Emotional Education.</p>
