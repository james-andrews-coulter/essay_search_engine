        <h3>8. Religion</h3>
<p>The School of Life is both a secular organisation and interested in many of the moves of religions. Some faith-based ideas (for example, the claim that the soul can be reincarnated, that Christ rose from the dead or that the creator of the cosmos made specific promises about land rights at the eastern end of the Mediterranean) have clouded some highly important psychological practices that religions were adept at promoting. Religions have been machines for addressing a range of important emotional needs, which endure even into a scientific era.</p>
<p>At their best, religions tried to keep ideas about forgiveness at the front of our minds; encouraged compassion; insisted that certain forms of worldly success were misleading ways of assessing the worth of people; got us to recognise our own capacities to hurt others and to feel sorry for doing so; nudged us to be tender and understanding towards the secret sufferings of others; and gave us helpful rituals and beautiful works of culture to keep important ideas before us throughout the year.</p>
<p>We see The School of Life as picking up many of the tasks of religion and creating secular substitutes for a range of religious ideals and practices. We believe in the idea that culture can and should replace scripture.</p>
<hr />
<p>This organisation is, ultimately, a school that believes that the ability to learn is one of the most basic things about human beings. The range of things that we can learn to do better, via instruction, is very wide – far wider than we tend to think.</p>
<p>The powerful influence of Romanticism, which is convinced that better emotional responses cannot be taught, means the current education system fails to pass emotional intelligence down the generations as it should.</p>
<p>The School of Life takes the more Classical view that all important human achievements, especially around emotions, can be transmitted: how to control rage; how to have a conversation; how to be a loving parent; how to be calmer or less inclined to bitterness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we at The School of Life are aware of how easily people are turned off by anything that appears too preachy and by a fatal tendency for what is worthy to come across as dull. Our commitment to education makes us profoundly interested in the task of seduction: the need to get and hold people’s attention artfully in a highly individualistic world filled with distractions and demands.</p>
<p>Because education is so central, The School of Life is ambitious about what learning should be like. It should not only be children who go to school. All adults should see themselves as in need of education pretty much every day. One should never be done with school. One should stay an active student, learning throughout life. In the adult section of schools, there should be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. Schools should be where a whole community gets educated, not just a place for children. Some classes should have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia, the phrase ‘I’ve finished school’ would sound extremely strange.</p>
<p>What follows are the key words and terms that underpin the project of emotional education to which we have given the name: The School of Life.</p>
