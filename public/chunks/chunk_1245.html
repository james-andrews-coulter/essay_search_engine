        <h2>Travelling without Me</h2>
<p>The American artist John Singer Sargent went to Capri for the first time in 1878, when he was 22 years old. He was at once enchanted. He loved the olive groves, the turquoise seas, the little restaurants and the whitewashed houses. He had a short, loving relationship with a working-class woman called Rosina and made a number of paintings of her — and of the nature and buildings of the island.</p>
<p>One of the first, almost automatic, responses to seeing Sargent’s landscapes is to be overwhelmed by a simple certainty: I want to go there (ideally very soon). How could we not, when the waters look so extraordinarily inviting; when we can imagine lolling in the turquoise shallows, then drying out on a towel on the beach by the rocks? Perhaps we will have brought a little picnic and will have some goat’s cheese and a sfogliatelle while looking out at the glittering horizon. Later in the afternoon, we might take a boat out to a nearby cove. In the evening, we might fall asleep to a full moon and the sound of cicadas. At last, here, we would be happy.</p>
<p>No one can contest the perfection of the images. But what we are in danger of forgetting is a huge inconvenience associated with going anywhere on the basis of an enchanting visual impression: that, if we were actually to go, each of us would have to take our self along. That ‘self’ is really a way of describing everything that makes being who we are so difficult day to day: all our depressive tendencies, compulsions, confusions, anxieties and sorrows. Certainly we would be faced with resplendent beauty, but we would also — more tragically — be looking at it through the smeared lens of our own maddening character.</p>
<p>This is one drawback that we are spared so long as we look at images of beautiful places in a book or on a screen. The act of looking is brief enough and the troublesome aspects of our personalities restrained enough that, for a few moments, we can immerse ourselves in the perfection of our surroundings without distortion, in a way that would — paradoxically — be impossible if we actually had to be there.</p>
<p>Were we by some mixed fortune to end up on a Capri beach, we would probably be troubled by our digestion, irritated by our lack of sleep, pained by a cut on our knee and upset by a sarcastic exchange with our partner. No such impediments need to worry us while we flip through a carefully selected set of images for a few minutes before dinner: we can be more ‘there’ than when we have to be there.</p>
<p>Without quite meaning to, images trick us. We might be more able to savour a place when we aren’t faced with the additional hurdle of having to stand for hours in the enervating heat in the company of our own absurd, immovable personality. We don’t, in reality, simply want to go to beautiful places; we want — more confusingly — to do so without ‘me’ in tow. We want a break from the appalling burden of being ourselves. We should fully appreciate that pictures have their advantages.</p>
