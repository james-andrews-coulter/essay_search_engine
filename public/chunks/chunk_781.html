            <h2>THE CHATTER</h2>
<p>So seriously does our age take itself that it doesn’t cease talking of its own melodramas and triumphs with a mesmerizing and maddening intensity. We have surrounded ourselves by gadgets that give us minute-by-minute insights into the perturbed and excited minds of billions of others—and that along the way deny us all necessary access to stillness, distance, and perspective, let alone time for self-knowledge and reflection. We grow convinced of the unerring importance of everything in the near term and can set nothing in its broader context. We pass our own mental perturbations on to one another under the guise of keeping ourselves “informed.” The media spreads our madness virally and without respite. We come under pressure to know at all times “what is going on,” without realizing how much we have abandoned ourselves to an enervating collective frenzy at the cost of our serenity and self-possession.</p>
<p>So pernicious are the trends of modernity, so greatly do they affect our chances of mental well-being, that sanity demands we exercise immense caution around our era and, as quietly as we need to, enter a state of what could be termed internal exile from some of its pressures. We may continue to benefit from the advantages of the modern age while simultaneously creating a wide berth between ourselves and its more destructive and cruel psychological ideals.</p>
<p>To do so, we might draw on a range of counter-cyclical ideas.</p>
<p>MODESTY</p>
<p>We know the attractions of extraordinary lives well enough: the glamour, the acclaim, the material abundance . . . What can be less familiar to us is their costs: the destruction of emotional stability, the frenetic activity, the lack of time in which to absorb experiences, the envy and hostility that success arouses, the fear of retribution, and the dread of downfall.</p>
<p>Once we have properly surveyed the merits and demerits on offer, we may willingly choose to side with what the modern age typically considers to be a disaster: a quiet life. This is not from any lack of ambition, but from a more focused aspiration for what we now recognize to be the primordial ingredient of happiness: peace of mind.</p>
<p>We might choose to live outside a large metropolis, not to push ourselves forward for promotion, to avoid the limelight, and to do a satisfactory but undramatic kind of work. We can discover the subtle greatness of a life in which we exercise our virtues on a domestic canvas, in which we do not seek to be known by people we don’t ourselves know and in which the intricate love of a few carefully chosen souls replaces the hurried attentions of a host of unfaithful strangers. In such quiet lives, we can go to bed early, avoid functions with people we despise, work only for the money we need to secure a materially adequate standard of living, drop out of the status race, and refuse to assess ourselves according to the alien standards of a corrupt media.</p>
<p>We will have liberated ourselves from the madness of the age when we can look on loud and heroic lives—perhaps led by people we once knew—and with good faith say that this is not for us, that we are happier where we are, because we at last understand what we really require to survive mentally: cosiness, connection, and an ongoing lack of drama.</p>
