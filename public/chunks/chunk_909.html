        <h2>Romantic Instinct</h2>
<p>For most of history, relationships were a rational business, to do with matching land, status and religion. Marriages were cold, ruthless and almost wholly disconnected from the happiness of their protagonists.</p>
<p>What replaced the Marriage of Reason was the Marriage of Instinct, an arrangement that dictated that feeling should be the supreme guide to the formation of good relationships. Passionate emotion became viewed as the ideal predictor of fifty years of conjugal happiness.</p>
<p>We have grown used to following our hearts. Unfortunately, only too often, these hearts prove troublingly deceptive and unreliable. Our instincts pull us not so much towards situations that will make us happy as situations that feel familiar, which might be quite a different thing.</p>
<p>This is because adult love intimately rehearses the themes of childhood love, and a great many of us learnt of love in childhood in less-than-ideal conditions. The love we tasted when we were small will likely have involved not only tenderness and affection but also (in some form or other) troublesome dynamics: there might have been depression, anger, withdrawal, abandonment, favouritism, a pressure to succeed, or a subtle call to fail.</p>
<p>When we reach adulthood, our ‘instinct’ then has a habit of impelling us towards situations that echo the less-than-ideal themes of childhood: we seek to find people of similar emotional maturity to our childhood caregivers. This explains why we so often find ourselves rejecting candidates who might on paper be eminently well matched and mature. Yet we cannot muster enthusiasm and complain that they are ‘boring’ or ‘not sexy’. What we may at a subliminal level mean is: simply not disturbed enough to make us suffer in the ways we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real.</p>
<p>The time has come to outgrow our veneration of ‘instinct’. We need relationships in which our feelings have been properly submitted to examination and brought under the aegis of a mature awareness of our long and always distinctively troubled psychological histories.</p>
