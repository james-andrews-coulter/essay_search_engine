        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The history of every life is made up both of the life we lead, and the richer, more ambitious one we dream of leading, but never quite do... because we are stretched out in the bath or on the sofa, too tired or worried, too distracted or despairing.</p>
<p>This alternative life could be ours if only we were able to get to our desks on time, rise early enough, ask people for what we need, remember how finite existence is – or if we went to see a psychotherapist. We squander some of our best possibilities to the quiet, unheralded tragedy of procrastination.</p>
<p>Our shame at the scale of our procrastination is part of the problem. We’re already so guilty about what we’re not doing that the very thought of examining our errors and taking action feels unbearable. It seems as if we have procrastinated far too much to deserve a new start.</p>
<p>We should be less hard on ourselves – and in the process, less fatalistic about the chances of change. Procrastination is a design flaw of the human animal, not an appalling and unique personal failing. We need to consider the problem rationally, talk about it openly and learn to take small, manageable steps to attenuate its worst ills.</p>
<p>The goal is not to remove procrastination altogether, but to understand its roots, appreciate when it may strike and work out its hold on us, so that we can plot a nimble path around it. Having learnt the art of managing our procrastination, we’ll still sometimes spend slightly too long on the sofa, but we will have opened up a major new possibility: that of eventually dying with fewer regrets.</p>
