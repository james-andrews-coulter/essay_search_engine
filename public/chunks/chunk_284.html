            <h2>2.  Challenges of Choice</h2>
<p>On the way home from work, you stop off at a popular chain store featuring rather inexpensive knock-off fashions. Half an hour later, having looked and tried on clothes in a sort of daze, you emerge with some tops in the latest colours and yet another scarf to add to your collection. Do you actually need them? Well, you think rather sheepishly, perhaps you’ll find a use for them later; maybe they’ll somehow change the way you look and think of yourself this summer. As you walk on, you think you should visit your mother, who has been feeling unwell; but you’ve been invited to a party at which who knows what may happen, or whom you may meet. You’re torn; you really don’t know what you should, or would actually prefer, to do.</p>
<p>*   *   *</p>
<p>For Emma, as for many of us, the problems of excessive busyness are compounded by the constant need to make choices and decisions, in matters ranging from frivolous to important, from material to moral. The sheer plenitude of material goods available to us – from food to fashion, ingenious home appliances to sexy cars – can itself result in forms of compulsive behaviour, as we can see in occasional outbreaks of mass consumer hysteria, in which people have been trampled by crowds pressing into shopping outlets when some big sale is announced. I must say that my memories of the old Eastern Europe, where only two kinds of shampoo and three colours of house paint were available at the best of times, occasionally acquire a certain idyllic tinge.</p>
<p>But in our advanced, multicultural democracies, the freedom – or is it the necessity – of choice extends to more essential and existential issues. On every level of our lives, from childbirth to death, from education to religion, from career to sexual identity, we are free to do as we like and to change our minds as often as we wish. Of course, the idea that we are totally free to choose is to some extent an illusion, as many commentators, including Renata Salecl in her insightful book The Tyranny of Choice, have pointed out. The range of our actual choices is limited by our circumstances, abilities and actual opportunities. I might wish I could be a wonderful ballerina, or buy that bottle-green Jaguar, but I can’t.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing – and much too much choice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because we are presented with ostensible options in all areas of life, we have a nagging sense that maybe we should be taking advantage of them. Even if we don’t want to break up with our current partner, we think that we could just perhaps find – or at least look for – others. After all, they are right out there in large numbers, on all those dating websites. Even if we are not about to leave our job, it is hard to get rid of a murmur in our head saying that we could find something more interesting, or more worthwhile, or better paid. We see other people doing something different or seemingly more gratifying all the time, both within our immediate vicinity, and in the larger world made visible to us by the old and new media. At the same time, the great diversity of lifestyles, options and values in our cultures and open societies means that there are few common criteria for making important life choices. How do you decide if it’s better to be more successful, or more devoted to the welfare of others? How do you ascertain if you prefer to be monogamous, or insouciantly serial in your relationships? At each level of our experience, we need to find motives and reasons for what we want or don’t want to do, within ourselves. At the same time, the sheer seductions of availability make it hard for us to decide among various options, and to separate external influences from our own values and preferences. Our minds are overcrowded in these less tangible ways as well, and this sometimes leads to a kind of stoppage, or the inability to make any decisions at all.</p>
<p>The same philosophers who made distinctions between momentary hedonism and deeper satisfaction thought that no matter what material comforts or refinements we enjoy, we cannot attain the good life without some idea of shaping purpose, or conviction of meaningfulness and worth, pervading our moments and activities. That is a grand goal and aspiration; but even on a less overarching scale, the plenitude of choice on every level makes finding a direction and ascertaining our own aims more difficult.</p>
<p>How then, given the pressures and distractions of our lives, can we regain our perspective and coherence of self? How can we reclaim a sense that our experiences have personal meaning and depth – that we are not moving through them routinely or shallowly? The pressures are real and not easily dispelled; and one kind of solution is to opt out of them altogether, and adopt various forms of ‘dropping out’: living in an isolated place, forsaking the idea of a regular job, or going off to a remote Zen monastery. Yet others declare a boycott on choice itself, taking an example from such books as Choosing Not to Choose by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein. I do not mean to dismiss such solutions; for some people, they are right and make for happier lives. But for most of us, these are extreme measures. Unless we are of a particularly meditative or solitary temperament, most of us want to live in the world and remain engaged with it. We want to be effective in what we do, to lead sociable lives and cultivate close relationships and friendships. We want, sometimes, to take risks, stretch ourselves further or have adventures.</p>
<p>The question for most of us is not how to retreat from the world, but how to retain our bearings within it, and to live more fully rather than just more busily. The temperate answer I want to propose is that we need to alternate periods of energetic activity with relaxed receptivity, directed effort with intervals of goal-less, undutiful leisure. Whether we have seen the neurological evidence or not, many of us sense the need for time free of distractions, and the deprivation that follows from its lack. It is easy, amidst the plethora of diversions and options offered by our societies, to lose track of why we do what we do, what we truly want, and what it is about our activities or our lives that we value and love. In order to discern or rediscover our own, internally impelled values and motives, we need to pull back from driven activity, and to take time to process and make sense of our experiences; to delve into the deeper strata of our inner lives, or to examine our situations through more analytic thought. We also need moments of unpressured idleness to replenish our energies and restore our capacity for ordinary pleasure and enjoyment. If we don’t take the time to do that, we can become depleted and disoriented, and begin to move through what we are doing automatically, without a conscious sense of purpose, or making real acts of choice. And that, eventually, makes us not only less satisfied, but less effective at what we do.</p>
<p>To put it simply, I want to remind us of what the early philosophers understood so well: the value and salutary power of reflection and self-knowledge. These are worth developing for their own sake; but I believe they are also necessary if we are to replace the excitement of hectic and sometimes aimless activity with full consciousness and purposeful engagement. True engagement – the ability to give ourselves deliberately and unreservedly to a task or a personal interaction – arises from a clear sense of our own desires, goals and intentions. It is when our energies and our perspective are replenished that we can return to our active lives with a renewed sense of pleasure and commitment. In other words, it is only if we periodically disengage, that we can become truly and effectively engaged.</p>
<p>This book has a tripartite structure: in the first part, I have tried to set out the problems of hyperactivity and excessive choice, and the states of mind they produce. In the second, I will consider the pleasures and uses of leisure, and mention some of my favourite ways to be idle, in the hope that they’ll stimulate some of your own ideas on the subject. These include not only passive relaxation, but cultivating all our capacities for curiosity, appreciation of beauty and creative contemplation – acts and states of self which nurture us and allow us to perceive the world more fully. In the third part I will look at the experience of happy absorption or ‘flow’ that follows from purposeful engagement, and its various expressions in work, relationships and creative play.</p>
<p>I have written about some of the problems of fast and slow temporality in my short book on Time. But the questions raised there have continued to preoccupy me, and here I would like to explore them from a different point of view, and to look not only at the patterns of human temporality, but how we can create ways of moving through time which are meaningful and enriching. A richness of experience proceeds from within and is intimately bound up with ways of understanding ourselves and our situation. I want to explore some of these connections, and to suggest that being fully and consciously involved in our lives is the only reliable antidote to the discomforts of ennui or anxious emptiness; and that for that, we need sometimes to take time off and time out.</p>
