        <h2>7. Arc of Life</h2>
<p>Henri Neuwen and Walter Gaffney’s small book Aging: The Fulfillment of Life (Doubleday, 1986) takes less than an hour to read – half of it is made up of photographs – but its shining humanity lingers for a long time after (and you don’t need to be a believer, as Neuwen was, to feel it).</p>
<p>Acknowledgements</p>
<p>This may be a slim volume but its gestation was long. Caroline Pick, Barbara Rosenbaum and Lennie Goodings have been constantly encouraging, as has my agent, the indefatigable Natasha Fairweather of AP Watt at United Agents. Gianna Williams helped me understand the subject in a different way. My thanks to Juliette Mitchell and The School of Life for their enthusiastic response to the book, to Cindy Chan at Pan Macmillan for her sensitive editing, and to Will Atkins for his splendid copyediting. My long-standing interest in ageing was inspired by my parents, Josef and Natalia, who were blessed with longevity: their vitality didn’t diminish in their nineties, my pianist mother giving her last concert at 94. My daughters, Bianca and Lola, have graciously tolerated my preoccupation with the subject of ageing; Bianca also supplied me with valuable links and suggestions for reading. Peter Lewis nourished me and made me laugh through the research and writing. He personifies the way that energy, curiosity and a passionate engagement with life can grow with age.</p>
