        <h3>The Roman Empire, AD 100</h3>
<p>Indolence is considered the greatest goal of life: whiling away your days at the baths and at dinner parties is the ideal (though in practice this option is, of course, open only to a tiny few). It is assumed that everyone naturally hates working – therefore slaves, peasants and serfs are kept under constant, brutal supervision. All forms of craft and trade are looked down on. Procrastination is deemed excellent: hopefully you can keep on putting off anything irksome or unpleasant for your entire life.</p>
