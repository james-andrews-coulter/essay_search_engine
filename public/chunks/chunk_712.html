        <h3>Questions to raise about a prospective partner</h3>
<p>•   Can this person apologise for their problematic sides?</p>
<p>•   Do they have a keen sense of their flaws?</p>
<p>•   Can they accept criticism?</p>
<p>•   Are they keen to improve themselves in a psychological sense? Do they know that progress in emotional maturity is desirable or possible?</p>
<p>•   Can they say sorry, warmly and generously?</p>
<p>•   Can they tolerate flaws – your flaws?</p>
<p>•   Do they have a rich interpretive model of where flaws come from?</p>
<p>•   Are they curious about the details of your inner life, especially events before you were 9 years old?</p>
<p>•   Are they comfortable revealing to you when they are upset? Can they be brave enough to share their disappointments? Can they ask for repair when you damage things inadvertently?</p>
<p>•   Can they laugh at themselves and at you with generosity and sympathy at the obvious chaos and disappointment of being human?</p>
<p>•   Can they reveal the intensity of their fears and longings? Are they able to access the younger version of themselves?</p>
<p>•   Can they allow you to parent their younger self occasionally?</p>
<p>•   Can they parent your younger self occasionally?</p>
<p>•   Can you be ‘mummy’ and ‘daddy’ to each other, as it were, when needed?</p>
<p>•   Are they patient with, and curious about, the madness of the human mind?</p>
<p>•   Have they made their peace with imperfection?</p>
<p>What the test reveals is that, to a strange and important extent, we’re not looking for someone who is objectively impressive; we’re trying to home in on the broken individual who can like us in our own secret complexity and whose admitted strangeness we, in turn, can embrace and be comforted by.</p>
