        <h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>I hope that this book will be useful to you, even if all you do is read it. However, in order to make connections, reading on its own is rarely enough. To really take on board the lessons in this book it is necessary to work experientially. It is one thing to know about something and another to embody it. In order to embody the habits of self-observation it is necessary to practise them; merely knowing about them is not enough. The point of a set of instructions that comes with a model-aeroplane kit is not to supply you with reading material, but to guide you in the practical steps you need to apply in order to build the kit. This exercise chapter is similar to such instructions. The exercises are not simply for reading, they are for doing. Either tackle these exercises on your own, with another person or in a group. Do not tackle too many exercises at once. Personally, one per day would be enough for me: this gives me time to allow insights to come up from the unconscious, and for any self-adjustment to take place.</p>
