            <h3>¶ Crushes</h3>
<p>A crush plays out in pure and perfect form the dynamics of the Romantic philosophy of love, with its combustible mixture of limited knowledge, outward obstacles to further discovery, and boundless hope.</p>
<p>When we see someone in the street, on the train, or in the library and feel almost at once that they are the answer, we are perhaps not wrong to feel that the stranger has some wonderful qualities, indicated by their eyebrows, quizzical smile or extremely handsome mustard-coloured coat. But our crush ignores a fundamental truth about people that Romanticism blithely ignores: that everyone, even the most apparently accomplished being, is radically imperfect and, were we to spend a long time around them, possibly maddening (even those who have adorable hair or the sweetest way of folding their skirt under them as they sit down on a park bench). We can’t yet know what the problems will be, but we can and should be certain that they are there, lurking somewhere behind the façade, waiting for time to unfurl them.</p>
<p>We have to impress this truth upon our Romantic minds – otherwise, in comparison with a crush, every actual relationship we ever have will seem horrendous and doomed. If we truly believe what our imaginations tell us during crushes, we’ll have no logical choice other than to break off our partnerships, which are likely to be somewhat disappointing yet deeply real and ultimately ‘good enough’.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy a crush we have to understand that that is what it is. If we think that we are encountering a person who will make us happy, who will be an ideal person to live with and grow old with, we are inadvertently destroying the specific satisfaction that a crush brings. The pleasure depends on our recognising that we are imagining an ideal person, not finding a real one.</p>
<p>To crush well is to realise that the lovely person we sketch in our heads is our creation: a creation that says more about us than them. But what it says about us is important. The crush gives us access to our own ideals. We may not really be getting to know another person properly, but we are growing our insight into who we really are.</p>
