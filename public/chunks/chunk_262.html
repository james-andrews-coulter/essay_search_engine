            <h1>How to Have Good Relationships</h1>
<p>This is a ‘how-to’ book and at this point I wish it was not, because as soon as we start to legislate for how to have relationships, we are already in danger of getting it wrong. This is because if we attempt to manipulate a relationship, there is a danger of treating the other as an ‘it’ rather than as an equal; of seeing him or her as an object to be steered rather than another subject to meet. Nor can we have a simple rule: ‘be empathetic’ – since empathy is only part of a process, not a rigid set of behaviours.</p>
<p>My friend Astrid had a rule she applied to relationships. When she was working out how she felt about someone she would say, for instance, ‘… And he asked me no questions about myself at all’ – as if she was seeking to prove something; but as I come from a different background I was not sure what it was she was trying to tell me. She explained that in her originating culture it was polite to ask questions when you meet a new person. If the other person does not return the compliment by showing curiosity in return then the suspicion is that they are self-absorbed and selfish. I thought that, as well as sounding like a post-rationalization for Astrid’s not taking to a particular person, this way of looking at the world did not take into account the ‘negative politeness’ rule14 which is an unspoken part of the rituals of my culture. Gross generalization coming up. Basically there are two sorts of cultures. In crowded countries such as Japan and Britain we tend to have ‘negative-politeness’. This means that people are aware of others’ need for privacy, and their desire not to be intruded upon. In countries where there is more space, like the USA, people are more inclined to practise ‘positive politeness’, where the emphasis is on inclusion and openness. The anthropologist Kate Fox says that what looks like stand-offishness in a negative-politeness culture is really a sort of consideration for people’s privacy. So you see, for every overarching rule about how to have relationships, there will always be another that contradicts it. You may act in a caring way towards somebody, but if you have not absorbed the rules of that person’s family of origin or culture you can still get it wrong.</p>
<p>Our codes about manners differ from family to family and culture to culture. Manners are a societal attempt to regulate the way we treat one another. If we follow manners strictly, we may turn into a ‘super-charmer’, and other people may doubt our sincerity. If we become extra sincere, we may appear over-earnest in a way that might be acceptable in, say, America but not in Britain. It is difficult to formulate guidelines about other people’s feelings because they vary so much, from culture to culture, from family to family, from person to person, and from moment to moment. We are either good at picking up on people’s feelings and attuning to them, or we are not. The way to learn how to be with someone is by being with them; if we cannot get that far we are a bit stuck. In trying to please one group of people we can end up offending another. Asking people what we are doing wrong will either upset us (when we get the answer), or will only tell us what we are doing wrong in their eyes – and it might not be us who is ‘wrong’ anyway. Adhering to strict guidelines about how to behave around others is a form of rigidity. Not being mindful of your impact upon others is a form of chaos. What we are seeking is a middle way, which can be defined as ‘flexibility’; this allows us to reach out and respond to others with attunement. This flexibility is something we can aim for but we should not expect to achieve it in every encounter. However, if we find forming any relationship at all difficult, we may need to invest in consulting a relationship expert, a psychotherapist or another kind of mental-health worker.</p>
<p>Very often we begin a relationship or an encounter with another person by engaging in small talk about the weather, or by playing out the sort of rituals that the transactional analyst Eric Berne identified in the Sixties as ‘games’. In developed countries, for instance, men may play a competitive game by arguing about whose car is best – ‘You’ve got the X5 M? Oh dear, not enough power. You have to have the X6 M model like mine.’ Women in such cultures, on the other hand, often practise competitive self-deprecation – ‘You say you like this dress? But it’s so old; I got it from a charity shop ten years ago.’ That game might be called the ‘Mine is Smaller than Yours’ game.</p>
<p>For me, small talk and ‘games’ like these can, at times, feel far more appropriate than ‘big talk’, especially before I have formed a bond with the other person. I once attended a counselling course in which students were encouraged to abandon their comfortable rituals and games and express the feelings that lay underneath them. I found this hard, because I am uncomfortable with the type of ‘real’ talk that involves saying things like, ‘I notice I am experiencing feelings of envy toward you’ before I have even taken off my coat. However, some people prefer this way of relating to preliminary chit-chat. I remember saying to some of my fellow students, ‘Does anyone want a coffee?’ They all shook their heads and asked me to rephrase my question to reflect my real feelings. So I had to feel and think and then I came up with, ‘I want coffee and I want you to come with me.’ Having tried it, I found I really liked this process of turning a ritualized question into a statement, and I still try to do this when I remember. Although it is more of a risk (making a statement about myself rather than asking a question of another makes me feel more vulnerable), I find expressing an invitation like this gives me more of a chance of connecting to others. However, saying ‘I want a coffee and I want you to come with me’ with the old crowd of ex-students has become so ritualized that it is now no different to saying ‘Does anyone want a coffee?’ If you try to bring meaning to every single word it becomes exhausting (for me, anyway) and if the once meaningful utterance gets repeated it too becomes like ritual, just as those exchanges about the weather have become ritualized. Being real and open is a way to make real connections with others, but connections are made in more ways than simply exchanging meaningful words, and I would never rule out the significance of small talk. We need it in order to bond, and to pave the way for ‘big talk’. It is the equivalent of monkey grooming15 or the mutual sniffing that dogs do, and we need it. (I would not actually fancy doing what dogs do, nor do I want to look for your fleas, so I will continue to find out what you think of this weather we’ve been having …)</p>
<p>In Watching the English, the anthropologist Kate Fox has observed that rules exist about how to talk about the weather, and as this is a how-to book, I will share one with you. The point is that when I tell you we have had a lot of rain recently, what I am really wondering is not whether you know how many inches of rainfall we have had but whether you are an agreeable sort of person. I am more likely to form a favourable opinion of you if you agree with me. This is the rule of reciprocity. Remarks about the weather are phrased as questions not because we care about the weather but because we want a response. You may not be particularly interested in the weather but that does not mean you do not care about your relationship with the person you are talking to. It does not matter that the words we use for this ‘nice-day-isn’t-it?’ ritual are empty. Such exchanges are not about what we say but how we acknowledge each other as we say it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whether we are adept at following such rules or not, we often trip ourselves up on the way to forming relationships, and sometimes stop ourselves from having them at all. There are many ingenious ways in which we unwittingly limit our contact with others and thus deprive ourselves of their potentially beneficial influence on us. Sometimes we assume we are having a relationship with another person when that relationship in fact exists mostly in our heads, because we are unknowingly misreading that person. Misreading can happen in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can project ourselves onto the other person, so instead of having an ‘I–You’ relationship, we have an ‘I–I’ relationship; ‘She will respond just as I would respond.’</li>
<li>We can objectify the other person and have an ‘I–It’ relationship: ‘If I phrase it like this, she will think of me like that.’</li>
<li>We can also blur the boundaries between the person with us in the present with people we have known before, and transfer our experience of people from the past onto this person in the present, and have ‘I–Ghost’ relationships: ‘If I do this, other people always respond like that.’
We tend to trust people in ways that are derived from past conditioning and experience. For example, we will have beliefs about how trust-worthy a person is. Some people learn to trust no one, and this causes them to lead lonely and often isolated lives that restrict the possibility of full mental health. In contrast, there are those who trust too much and are therefore too vulnerable. Trust is just an example. To a lesser and greater extent we all view people through the lens of our past experiences, and we need to do this. For instance, it is not appropriate to ask the bus driver to show us his driving licence; we have to take it on trust that he knows what he is doing. The key, though, is to be aware of the patterns we fall into when summing people up, and to learn to hold our views lightly and be more open to finding out about the people in front of us.</li>
</ul>
<p>A group of people I find I always learn from are children, as they can offer us fresh eyes on the world and a new perspective. A schoolboy chatting to me recently said that he thought sanity is not about how knowledgeable you are, or how ‘realistic’. He knows some clever people with first-class degrees and doctorates who have loads of facts at their fingertips; nevertheless, he experiences some of them as less than sane because they cannot relate to others. He also knows some people who believe in things he personally finds odd (like God or homeopathy) and, although he finds their beliefs unrealistic, he finds some of them appear saner than some members of the former group. He thought this was because sanity has more to do with openness and emotional honesty than with leak-proof logic.</p>
