        <h2>How to Deal with the Meanness of the World</h2>
<p>We live in a world that, much of the time, gives off an appearance of kindness. People say sorry if they bump into us in the street, there’s a lot of smiling and gentleness in many homes and offices, modern schools – especially for younger children – devote sincere effort to fostering respect.</p>
<p>This can make it all the more surprising when we discover – in the course of our failure – something that we probably suspected (but tried not to believe) from the outset: that beneath a very thin layer of civility, human beings are capable of extraordinary cruelty. We don’t have to wait for a war to break out to realise this; reserves of malevolence and unkindness throb beneath the most innocent circumstances – and are drawn like iron filings to the magnet of failure.</p>
<p>An everyday example of this malevolence can be witnessed in the minor, but telling, arena of comment sections beneath online articles. Here, in anonymity, we encounter the true thoughts of people who might otherwise have smiled or apologised if their umbrella became entangled with ours in the street.</p>
<p>The world’s religions have collectively spent billions of hours stressing compassion, forgiveness, generosity, meekness, love, empathy and friendship. Over centuries, they have sought to make progress with our souls. But online comments prove that all efforts at moral education and ethical evolution have made no progress whatsoever. We remain – for the most part – the unkind beasts we always were.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps we read an article explaining that a 30-year-old female prison officer has slept with an inmate a decade younger than she. She is married and has two small children. She has apologised profoundly for a moment of madness, but it didn’t help. She was sacked and given a three-year suspended sentence – and barred from employment in most fields. Her husband left her; her father disowned her. She tried to kill herself, failed, but managed to lose an arm in the attempt. A journalist has written up the story and we scroll to the comments:</p>
<p>– Scum.</p>
<p>– Better luck next time.</p>
<p>– Unfair! If it had been a man, he would have got a decade behind bars.</p>
<p>– What a lenient sentence.</p>
<p>– It’s sickos like this who run the world.</p>
<p>This, in a world where people will pick up litter in parks and parents spend time teaching their children to say ‘thank you’ after someone has passed them a cup of water. Deep down, we harbour impulses that would have made Jesus and the Buddha weep and accept their work had all been in vain.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves against surprise when faced with such facts, we should shed our innocence once and for all. We will be fortified by accepting the grim truth at the earliest opportunity: without any cynical meaning, the truth is that other people – most other people – are simply extremely mean-spirited. Large numbers of humans (what we call ‘society at large’) are empty of love and tolerance. There may be the odd sentimental effusion here and there, but the rule is that forgiveness and generosity cannot be counted on. Kindness is the firm exception.</p>
<p>Therefore, if and when we fail, we must be ready for nothing less than constant nastiness. It is nothing personal. We should not allow ourselves to assume otherwise, or to be led astray by the present sunny demeanour of people at the dentist’s office or the flower shop. Most of our so-called friends will desert us; most strangers will uncritically repeat the worst things said about us; and if a story about us makes it into the papers, most comments written beneath it will need to be read only when we are heavily sedated or in the presence of a doctor or psychotherapist.</p>
<p>If we hear or read vicious statements about ourselves, it is understandable that we might lose our minds or seek to kill ourselves. We would need to be very brutish and coarse inside not to feel such temptations. How could we possibly be brought up to respond well to literature and art, to be open to experience and to be vulnerable in love – and yet somehow not take it as an affront worthy of suicide if we read that we are apparently ‘a piece of shit’, ‘an undeserving pervert’, ‘someone everyone always hated’ or ‘a loser who should never have been born’. It takes a degree of insensitivity few of us can or should lay claim to to be able to read such material and assume that life can continue to be some sort of tolerable journey.</p>
<p>In order to try to recover equanimity – as part of our ongoing project to resist a very understandable wish to die – we need to understand what is going on. The meanness has explanations – and the more we have a secure handle on them, the less the meanness will weigh on us. We will still mind, but we will – with luck, when we are well rested – not necessarily be so intensely driven to die.</p>
<p>A crucial step is to recognise that no one would ever be so mean who was not, somewhere inside, extremely unhappy. It wouldn’t occur to someone balanced, sane and fulfilled to spit on the defenceless online corpse of their enemy. It wouldn’t satisfy anyone who had a sense of purpose, who was loved and who liked themselves, to grind a stranger (however stupid or impulsive they had been) into the dust. Keeping this firmly in our thoughts helps to restore balance in our relationship with our bullying foes. They may seem extremely strong and we may appear defenceless and at their mercy, but their despicable behaviour indicates that they must – inside – be feeling utterly abject and despondent about themselves and their prospects – for only this could explain their glee in our failure. Beneath their confident demeanour, they are wrestling with a sense of overwhelming worthlessness. All schadenfreude is, at heart, a symptom of pain, suffering and a lack of fulfilment. We can’t know exactly what the other’s problem is, but we can be assured that there is one. And while we may not be able to get back directly at our enemies, by a strange piece of cosmic justice we can know that something or someone has got there first; their behaviour is proof of the scale of their inner misery.</p>
<p>This may seem implausible initially simply because of how widespread the hatred and ill feeling directed at us appears to be. Can we really believe that this level of viciousness could be so common and yet still unjustified? Doesn’t it simply indicate that settled public opinion has reasonably decided that we are awful?</p>
<p>Before we panic, however, we should take notice of how widespread unhappiness is – and therefore why it is entirely predictable and logical that 1,000 or even 10,000 horrible comments might be left beneath a story about us in the press, or that a large crowd should be outside the door baying for blood. This degree of meanness isn’t a sign of legitimacy; it’s evidence of how much misery is in circulation among human beings.</p>
<p>Though the details will vary from case to case, grave disappointment is a constant across populations. The average person, from the moment they wake to the moment they lose consciousness, will be the victim of a stream of slights, large and small – too many almost to register and take issue with, but enough to fill underground cisterns of vengefulness and anger. Their children don’t respect them. Their partner no longer admires them. They have been sidelined in their job – which they find repetitive and dispiriting anyway. Their friends are half-hearted in their enthusiasm for them. Their parents let them down. Their house is mediocre, their town in decline. None of it may sound so bad in isolation, but taken together, day after day, there is plenty here to supercharge the batteries of fury and envy.</p>
<p>Much of the time there will be no outlet for this rage. The afflicted person is left to slam the front door, snap at their partner, become impatient with their children or nurse dark thoughts about outsiders. But then, a story of someone else’s failure pops up and for a moment there is a satisfying sense that this other person may be to blame for all the disappointments – and their annihilation promises to purify one’s own circumstances.</p>
<p>Everyone could, in theory, behave with benevolence and sensitivity. But this doesn’t come naturally when a person has had to wait for the bus for forty minutes in the rain, when they haven’t had sex in a month, when the boiler has broken again, when three of their good friends earn four times as much as they do, when they have a searing pain in their left knee – and when no one has been properly kind and thoughtful about their life and circumstances for many years.</p>
<p>What may also explain the hatred that descends on us is the extent to which our misdeeds and errors hold a denied, unconscious allure to those who jeer and condemn us most intensely. Our bitterest foes might also, at some level, want to have an affair or leave their family behind. They might secretly desire to get drunk and speak their mind or cheat the accounts. The condemnation is being driven by attempts to pin on one specific person longings that many others share in their depths. They hate in us a disavowed part of themselves.</p>
<p>We might imagine that the way to create a kinder world would be to lecture people on manners and ethics – but what we really need is a world in which everyone is shown sufficient kindness so that stamping on others no longer holds such allure. The true measure of a civilisation is the degree to which people can be good and generous even when no one is watching. This is possible only when they do not feel emotionally exhausted and belittled, because they have been cared for in the past – and so have reserves of tenderness to lend to others in the future.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that at our moment of failure, it’s likely that we will meet with quite so much hatred – that thousands of people may seem keen to deny our remaining claims to humanity just when we need them most. But when the time comes, we must cling to a richer explanation of why this sort of nastiness unfolds. It isn’t because we are such awful people (just averagely muddled and sinful ones). Rather, there is no spirit of forgiveness at large because there isn’t sufficient love in circulation. We are a mean world because, despite all of our apparent wealth, we are such a limitlessly unhappy one. Our enemies aren’t simply cruel, and they definitely aren’t correct: they just feel very, very unloved.</p>
