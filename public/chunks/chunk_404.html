        <h3>Parental failure</h3>
<p>We dream of close and tender bonds with our closest family members, but without envisaging the consequences, there are certain things we do that can – seemingly irreparably – alienate us from those we love most.</p>
<p>The pain of this alienation can be especially acute with our own children. Despite our good intentions, we may end up behaving in ways that earn us their permanent opprobrium. Perhaps we have an affair or divorce their mother or father; maybe we take a job in another city or force them to relocate to another country. Or, at a time when they were especially vulnerable, we may be visited by problems we cannot control and that we regret every day of our lives: heavy drinking or addiction to drugs, depression or anxiety, being manic or paranoid. Alternatively, we might be beholden to a rigid or naïve theory of parenting or politics. Or more broadly, something might hold us back from expressing the love and care we feel deep down.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is no way back from our errors. Despite every attempt to apologise, we are told that we are not welcome. We understand; we don’t hold it against them. We know that it’s not the job of a child to dig deeply into the mind of their parent or to extend empathy towards someone who should always have been there for them in uncomplicated ways. They had a right to expect regularity, predictability and kindness. They never signed up to rages, a scandal all their friends could read about online or a new family they were expected to go on holiday with. No wonder they want to keep their distance.</p>
<p>Now, every time we see a young child playing happily with a parent in the park, we don’t just see a scene of innocence and kindness, we receive another reminder of our ineptness and selfishness. We know in no uncertain terms that we are monsters, whose errors have severed us from those it was our simple and ultimate duty to care for properly.</p>
