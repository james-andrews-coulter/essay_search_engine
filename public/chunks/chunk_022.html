        <h3>1. Good listening</h3>
<p>History is filled with people who grew famous for being good at speaking. However, there is no comparably glorious roster of those who have been acclaimed for doing something equally or even arguably more valuable: listening properly. Our collective idea of participating in conversation has from the first been unfairly focused on what people manage to say, almost never on what they manage to hear.</p>
<p>In a world where everyone seems to talk past one another, to genuinely listen is one of the most constructive and warmhearted things we can ever offer another person – and a major building block of any worthwhile union. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude we are likely to want to offer a companion who can put aside their concerns and make our own turmoils vivid and clear in their minds for a time.</p>
<p>Crucially, we do not – most of us – set out to be such poor listeners. We are so only by accident and for rather poignant reasons too: because no one has ever properly listened to us. We are trapped within a vortex of mutual disregard that makes every individual less likely to know how to appease another’s yearnings. What then might be some of the key moves that a good listener could make in order to reverse the collective slide towards universal deafness?</p>
<p>The first is to get better at offering encouragement to those who speak to us. Contrary to expectations, most of us do not naturally have a torrent of things we feel we want to tell others. Years of not being listened to take their toll. We easily feel we are boring; we have been hammered into assuming that our voices are not especially compelling and that our reflections do not merit sustained attention. We’re therefore likely to start a story with a certain hesitation and then, looking around us furtively, to stop at the slightest hint of tedium. ‘Oh it doesn’t really matter,’ we might say, before turning a friend’s focus elsewhere. When we come close to something especially raw and fascinating, remembering how often such material hasn’t landed properly, we may be beset by an acute impression of offending those around us. ‘You can’t possibly find this interesting,’ we may insist, just as we approach a truly important detail that we long in our depths to be understood for.</p>
<p>An early task of a good listener, therefore, is to help quash the speaker’s self-doubt. When they feel their friend stumbling or losing confidence, good listeners will be ready with a swift and heartfelt ‘That’s so interesting’ or a sympathetic and highly attuned ‘Go on …’</p>
<p>Shaped by unreceptive histories, speakers tend to rush over their accounts: ‘It was a diﬃcult childhood, I suppose …’; ‘Mum was often unwell at that time …’; ‘Dad can be a bit elsewhere when he drinks …’ The good listener intimates how much more must lie beneath these summaries and is ready with followup questions: ‘How did it make you feel?’; ‘Were there particular incidents that stuck out?’; ‘What was the house like at that time?’ These second-order enquiries, however slight, provide the crucial, and so often absent, signal that tells the speaker: ‘I am here, I am engaged, and I want to understand more.’ Such curiosity has a transformative effect. In the right company, we start to feel more interesting to ourselves on the basis that we have managed to animate someone else. A pleasant friend is someone who says interesting things to us. A really great one does something yet more valuable: helps us to find ourselves interesting.</p>
<p>The single best way to show that we have properly heard someone is to repeat what they have said using slightly different words. They might, for example, tell us: ‘Mum and Dad were keen to suggest that everything was fine, but we children knew it wasn’t true. What’s more, the constant cheerfulness started to weigh on us because we suspected it was a sign of trouble …’ The good listener scans the narrative and carefully repackages it in alternative but faithful language: ‘So it seems you were living with a lot of lies and began to distrust the good times …’ With a well-formed précis, we aren’t just told that someone has heard us; we have visceral proof that they have done so.</p>
<p>As they pay attention to a speaker, a good listener will become aware of how often painful and diﬃcult material is imparted without the layer of emotions that it rightly deserves. Stories of divorce, illness, death or poverty may be narrated in a factual way without exploring their psychological impact. This is another legacy of having lived in a depleted environment without being encouraged to acknowledge what it felt like. The good listener helps to return a raft of missing feelings to the speaker – be they of anger or loss, grief or melancholy. ‘That sounds really tough,’ the listener might say. Or: ‘That must have hurt a lot.’ Or simply, with warm, sad eyes: ‘I’m so sorry.’ A story that might have been told entirely without affect suddenly starts to move the speaker themselves. They can – perhaps for the first time – directly experience the emotions that the prevailing inattention had denied them. There may be many tears.</p>
<p>In all this, there is one important move that good listeners don’t attempt: they don’t – however seductive it might appear – make any direct bid to solve the speaker’s problems. They step sharply back from what – at first sight – may seem like an obvious and kindly act: to reassure a friend and solve their diﬃculties.</p>
<p>They don’t tell those worried about their employment that the dispute at work is sure to have a happy ending. They don’t give practical advice about how to find a better partner. They don’t rush to deliver a lecture on why a Stoic approach to pain always reaps dividends. They do something infinitely wiser and kinder: they let the speaker explore their own feelings of confusion and distress without a panicky urge to force a neatly packaged resolution on them. They don’t allow their own anxieties around sharing pain to stifle their companion’s chance to express themselves.</p>
<p>It’s easy to grow vague about what friendship – and the love that underpins it – might really involve. We will know we have found a friend worthy of the word when we feel patiently and quietly witnessed in our entirety, in all our painful and chaotic complexity. Friends sometimes ask one another what they might want for their birthdays. There is only one answer worth giving, a luxury and a privilege so great we may have lost sight of how much we long for it: to be properly listened to for an hour or so.</p>
