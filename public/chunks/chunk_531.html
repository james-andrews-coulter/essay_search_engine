            <h2>There’s Enough Time Left</h2>
<p>Until quite late on in his life, the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant was regarded by his contemporaries as prone to wasting his time. He went to many parties, he flirted, he chatted away amiably all afternoon and evening. It wasn’t until he was in his late fifties that he published his first important book: a very difficult, but highly influential, treatise on the basic structure of experience called the Critique of Pure Reason. Over the next decade he wrote two more major works, the Critique of Practical Reason (which is about ethics) and the Critique of Judgement (which seeks to answer the question: what is beauty?) Together they established Kant as one of the great thinkers of modern times. Yet it had all come very late indeed (life expectancy for a man of his era was forty-four).</p>
<p>Johann Gottlieb Becker, Immanuel Kant, 1768</p>
<p>We sometimes use the fact that we have wasted a lot of time as a reason not to begin. It seems impossible that we could be more than halfway through our lives and yet still have a chance to pull off something important: start a family, run a business, invent a machine, write a book or build a house. Tales of late achievers are therefore of particular importance to the self-hating, self-doubting procrastinating ones among us.</p>
<p>We should not be embarrassed by the amount of time we have wasted sitting on the sofa. It has probably taught us a lot; it has left us with a reservoir of self-disgust we can use to fire our efforts; and it has brought us fruitfully closer to that ultimate deadline to ensure that we now have the motivation to finish our real work before our time is up.</p>
