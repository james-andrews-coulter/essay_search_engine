        <h2>Venice</h2>
<p>One of the most widely accepted ideas espoused by modern architects, designers and cultural critics is that no one can really say what beauty is; the answer is always subjective, it is always only ever in the eyes of the beholder. That is why our modern cities are in the habit of looking extremely strange. The new opera house may resemble an inverted washing up bowl or a squashed rabbit, but that’s just you and you might be old or a ‘snob’. And while the new violet and lime-green towers on the horizon may seem obviously monstrous in your eyes, that’s a subjective opinion which it would be deeply inappropriate to assume that anyone else shares.
And yet, despite this official line, it is more than clear that, in reality, there is extremely widespread agreement about what a beautiful city might be. Whatever the architects or cultural relativists might claim, it’s selfevidently not Frankfurt or Milton Keynes, Detroit or Santiago, Chengdu or Lille. The beautiful cities are Amsterdam (19 million visitors a year), Paris (30 million), Barcelona (32 million) and Venice (36 million). People show us what they think is beautiful in a very simple and clear way: by going there. The best indicator of underlying agreement about urban design is tourist numbers.
People want to live in and visit places with regular street patterns, fouror five-storey buildings (at most), a tight core, symmetrical fagades with variegated window sizes, mixed residential and commercial zones and a repeated vernacular style that fits in with the Prevailing climate, geography and culture. It sounds relatively simple, and it is. We can look at places as distinct as Kyoto and San Francisco, York and Quito and swiftly perceive the broad principles of a good city.
The problem is that we have fetishised beauty as if it might be the result of divine inspiration or never-to-be-repeated genius. We have honoured successful cities by turning them into theme parks and setting them in aspic. We have not extrapolated outwards from their specific examples towards universally applicable rules of city-making that we might take back home and set to work on in our own locations. We are too tolerant of ugliness in certain places and too mystical about beauty in others.
Venice is, of course, astonishingly pretty, but we are killing it with our derivative and sterile admiration. A true homage would mean not trying to add yet more crowds to St Mark’s Square; it would involve attempting to apply to other cities in the world some of the lessons that have made this particular settlement such a success. We wouldn’t be building a pastiche (that would be a misunderstood lesson), but playing another, sympathetic tune on the keyboard of urbanism.
The promise of industrialisation has been to make what is good and desirable widely available. We have done this with great success around clothes and phones, cars and sofas; no longer are these accessible only to a narrow aristocratic clique. We should do the same with cities, travelling to the beautiful ones to learn their lessons and then applying these everywhere, so that fewer people might need to go to, and thereby help destroy, the legendary masterworks of the urban past.</p>
