            <h3>Overcoming thepressure to be exceptional</h3>
<p>It’s a simple question that gets to the core of someone’s sense of well-being and legitimacy: did your childhood leave you feeling that you were, on balance, OK as you were, or did you derive the impression that you needed to be extraordinary in order to deserve a place on Earth? To raise an associated question: are you now relaxed about your status, or else a manic overachiever – or filled with shame at your so-called mediocrity?</p>
<p>Around one-fifth of us will be in the uncomfortable cohort, alternately refusing to believe that anything could ever be enough or cursing ourselves as ‘failures’ (by which we in essence mean that we have not managed to beat insane statistical odds). At school, we probably worked very hard, not because we were drawn to the topics, but because we felt compelled for reasons that were not clear at the time; we just knew we had to come close to the top of the class and revise every evening. We may not be exceptional right now, but we are seldom without an acute sense of pressure to be so.</p>
<p>In childhood, the story might have gone like this. A parent needed us to be special – by virtue of intelligence, looks or popularity – in order to shore up a floundering sense of their own self. The child needed to achieve and could not, therefore, just be; their own motives and tastes were not to be part of the picture. The parent was privately in pain, unable to value themselves, battling an unnamed depression, furious with the course of their own lives, perhaps covertly tortured by their spouse. The child’s mission, for which there was no option but to volunteer, was to make it all better.</p>
<p>It seems odd to look at achievement through this lens – not as the thing the newspapers tell us it is, but very often as a species of mental illness. Those who put up the skyscrapers, write the bestselling books, perform on stage or make partner may in fact be the unwell ones. Conversely, the characters who, without agony, can bear an ordinary life, the so-called contented ‘mediocrities’, may be the emotional superstars, the aristocrats of the spirit, the captains of the heart. The world divides into the privileged who can be ordinary and the damned who are compelled to be remarkable.</p>
<p>The best possible outcome for the latter is to have a breakdown. Suddenly, after years of achievement, they can – if they are lucky – no longer get out of bed. They fall into a profound depression. They develop all-consuming social anxiety. They refuse to eat. They babble incoherently. They in some way poke a very large stick in the wheels of day-to-day life and are allowed to stay home for a while. A breakdown is not merely a random piece of madness or malfunction, it can be a very real – albeit inarticulate and inconvenient – bid for health. It is an attempt by one part of our minds to force the other into a process of growth, self-understanding and self-development that it has hitherto been too cowed to undertake. If we can put it paradoxically, it is an attempt to jump-start a process of getting well – properly well – through a stage of falling very ill.</p>
<p>In an apparently ill state, we might cleverly be seeking to destroy all the building blocks of our previous driven yet unhappy careers. We may be trying to reduce our commitments and our outgoings. We may be trying to throw off the cruelty of others’ expectations.</p>
<p>Our societies – which are often unwell at a collective and not just an individual level – are predictably lacking in inspiring images of good-enough ordinary lives. They tend to associate these with being a loser. We imagine that a quiet life is something that only a failed person without options would ever seek. We relentlessly identify goodness with being at the centre, in the metropolis, on the stage. We don’t like autumn mellowness or the peace that comes once we are past the meridian of our hopes. But there is, of course, no centre; or rather, the centre is oneself.</p>
<p>Occasionally an artist will bring such bathetic wisdom home. Here is the French writer and philosopher Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), capturing the point in the third volume of his Essays, written a few years before his death:</p>
<p>‘Storming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household – and with yourself – not getting slack nor belying yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.’</p>
<p>In the late 1650s, the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675) painted a picture called The Little Street which continues to challenge our value system to this day.</p>
<p>Johannes Vermeer, The Little Street, c. 1657–1658</p>
<p>Success might in fact be nothing more than a quiet afternoon with the children, at home, in a modest street. A similar point is made in certain stories by Chekhov or Raymond Carver; in Bob Dylan’s Time Out of Mind; in the films of Eric Rohmer, in particular Le Rayon Vert (1982); and in Thomas Jones’s study of A Wall in Naples (1782).</p>
<p>Thomas Jones, A Wall in Naples, c. 1782</p>
<p>Most movies, adverts, songs and articles, however, do not tend to go this way. They continually explain to us the appeal of sports cars, tropical islands, fame, an exalted destiny, first-class air travel and being very busy. The attractions are sometimes perfectly real, but the cumulative effect is to instil in us the idea that our own lives must be close to worthless.</p>
<p>However, there may be immense skill, joy and nobility involved in what we are up to: in bringing up a child to be fairly independent and balanced; in maintaining a good-enough relationship with a partner over many years despite areas of extreme difficulty; in keeping a home in reasonable order; in getting a lot of early nights; in doing a not very exciting or well-paid job responsibly and cheerfully; in listening properly to other people; and, in general, in not succumbing to madness or rage at the paradox and compromises involved in being alive.</p>
<p>There is already a treasury to appreciate in our circumstances when we learn to see these without prejudice or self-hatred. As we may discover once we are beyond others’ expectations, life’s true luxuries might comprise nothing more or less than simplicity, quiet friendship based on vulnerability, creativity without an audience, love without too much hope or despair, hot baths and dried fruits, walnuts and the odd sliver of very dark chocolate.</p>
