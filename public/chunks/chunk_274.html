        <h1>1. The One-Minute Exercise</h1>
<p>For sixty seconds focus all your attention on your breathing. Breathe normally and return your attention to your breath whenever it wanders, without trying to change how you are already breathing. Attempt this without thinking in words.</p>
<p>It takes years of practice before we can maintain this sort of alert, clear attention for even a single minute. This is not an exercise at which you can fail. It is about your experience of the practice. This simple breathing exercise provides a foundation for subsequent exercises, but do not wait until you can achieve it before trying other exercises. Simply return to it often.</p>
<p>When one minute is up, notice how the exercise was for you. How did directing your focus feel? Did you notice a change in mood? How did doing the exercise affect you and how long do its effects last?</p>
