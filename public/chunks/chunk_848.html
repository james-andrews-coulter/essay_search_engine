        <h3>(iv) A therapeutic attitude</h3>
<p>To state it boldly – and to risk sounding somewhat strange – all good lovers are in a way good psychotherapists; that is, the success of modern romantic relationships critically depends on the degree to which both partners can, at crucial moments, adopt a therapeutic attitude towards the other’s compulsions, blind spots, rages and eccentricities.</p>
<p>This sounds odd to say because we usually see therapy as something only a professional can do in a consulting room after years of training, rather than as anything that we and a partner might be able to offer one another in the kitchen, the bedroom or over a cocktail in a small but rather elegant bar.</p>
<p>Yet if we drill down into the true nature of psychotherapy, our perspective changes. At base, the discipline relies on a theory about how emotional life works. Powerful emotions – therapy says – are triggered in the present by traumas and difficulties that began in a distant and usually largely forgotten past.</p>
<p>The essence of psychotherapy lies in a willingness to get systematically interested in why we constantly respond in the bizarre and uncalled-for ways we exhibit. It asks by what sequence of formative experiences an otherwise perfectly decent and intelligent person could be led to sob on the floor or threaten to jump out of the window after being asked to tidy a drawer or rewrite a paragraph. It’s less disturbed by a tantrum, a sulk or a cold withdrawal than it is curious about where such over- or under-reactions might be coming from.</p>
<p>For therapy, there is always a good – and often moving – story about why someone ends up shouting ‘Fuck off you bastard!’ at the person they most love or gets icily dismissive when another is pleading for warmth. Perhaps far back, in the old house decades ago, there were genuine, urgent emotional terrors that had to be countered by aggression or evaded by massive psychological withdrawal. While the body has grown, the deep patterns of the mind have stayed the same, so that one now reacts not to what is presently happening but to an old threat that has been unknowingly re-evoked. The brutish words or cold facade are – when the logic of the mind is properly disentangled – directed not at a partner but at a carer, parent or rival in a now hazy, convoluted backstory.</p>
<p>In the consulting room, disturbed feelings can gradually be repatriated so that we no longer unleash them, haphazardly, on whomever happens to be most prominent in our lives. We grow appropriately therapeutic when we can be genuinely interested in the long history that might be standing behind the least alluring and at times appalling emotional conduct of which we and our partners are capable. As therapeutically minded lovers, we no longer always ask why they are being so horrible to us – we try to work out what other people might long ago have done to and around them.</p>
<p>We realise that we’ve come along late in the history of others’ souls; they are fighting emotional battles that commenced many years before they could have suspected our existence. They dug themselves into defensive positions or honed their offensive tactics – to which we are now exposed – by the time they were mastering the eight times table. It isn’t their fault. They didn’t ask to have the childhood they did; they coped as best they could and we, now, are simply the haphazard targets for their largely unconscious – albeit often genuinely off-putting – strategies of defence.</p>
<p>Along the way, psychotherapy teaches us that direct confrontation is seldom a good idea. A therapist might know, pretty much from day one, what a client is suffering from. They might have a solid thesis that the client is mentally scrambled because their mother’s abundant love carried with it a secret command that they must never acknowledge any sexual feelings. Or that they are paranoid because of their father’s displays of violence and cruelty. But what counts isn’t that the therapist has developed an accurate diagnosis, but rather that the patient is allowed to recognise it for themselves, by a process of carefully designed prompts, in a way that they can absorb without fear, in their own time. That is why therapists tend to proceed via gentle questions – ‘I wonder how it felt when Mum went away?’ – instead of blanket assertions: ‘Let me tell you why you are so messed up.’</p>
<p>In relationships, too, therapeutic kindness should mean avoiding direct lectures on the issues we sense in our partners. We try (on a good day) not to say: ‘I’ve seen through you. I know what’s wrong with you and why you are running away from me as you are.’ We strive instead to nudge the other towards greater self-knowledge at a pace they can benefit from. There are no prizes for trying to initiate others into varieties of self-awareness they have no strength for.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in relationships that work well, the burden of analytic interpretation never falls only on one person; we’re both prepared to see each other through an even-tempered therapeutic lens. We can mutually promise: ‘I’ll be less frightened of what’s disturbed yet disguised in you, if you can begin to imagine doing the same for me and my foibles.’</p>
<p>Everyone – in the close-up, prolonged inspection entailed by all relationships – is sure to reveal themselves as being substantially disturbed. Which is why we so want and need to be with someone who grasps, with reference to the complexities of our early emotional lives, the essential normality of our oddities. They might win our hearts by saying, on an early date: ‘I’ll tell you about how mad I am and where it all began, if you’ll tell me how crazy you are and how Mum and Dad messed you up.’ We’ll thereby be deploying the possibilities of a therapeutically minded perspective to help secure the long-term, sympathetic love we are looking for.</p>
