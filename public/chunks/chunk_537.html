            <h3>5. Work</h3>
<p>One of the distinctive ideas of modern times is that we don’t expect work to be simply a drudgery that we have to undertake to survive. We have high expectations of this huge part of our lives. Ideally, we want work to be ‘meaningful’, which involves the belief that we are in some way either reducing the pain or increasing the happiness of other humans.</p>
<p>Three big reasons stand out for why meaningful work has become difficult to secure:</p>
<p>Firstly, it is perilously hard for us to locate our true interests in the time we have before sheer survival becomes an imperative. Our interests don’t manifest themselves spontaneously; they require us to patiently analyse ourselves and try out a range of options, to see what feels like the best ‘fit’ for us. Unfortunately, schools and universities, as well as society at large, don’t place much emphasis on helping people to understand their authentic working identities. There is far more stress on simply getting ready for any job as opposed to identifying a job that would be particularly well suited to us. This is a pity – not just for individuals, but for the economy as a whole – because people work more imaginatively and more fruitfully when their deep selves are engaged.</p>
<p>Secondly, many jobs are relatively meaningless because it’s very possible, in the current economy, to generate profits from selling people things that don’t fundamentally contribute to well-being, but prey instead on their appetites and lack of self-command.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a job may have real meaning while not feeling as if it does day to day because many organisations are so large, so slow-moving, and so split up over continents that the purpose of everyone’s work gets lost amid meetings, memos, conference calls and administration.</p>
<p>This diagnosis helps to point the way to how we could make work more meaningful:</p>
<p>Firstly, pay a lot more attention to helping people find their vocation – their authentic working selves.</p>
<p>Secondly, the more we, as customers, support businesses engaged in meaningful work, the more meaningful jobs there will be. By raising the quality of demand, we raise the number of occupations that answer to humanity’s deeper needs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in businesses that do carry out meaningful work, but on too large a scale over too long a period for it to feel meaningful, there is scope to narrate stories of the organisation’s purpose that offer a more tangible sense of every individual’s contribution to the whole.</p>
<p>Ensuring that work is meaningful is no luxury. It determines the greatest issue of all in modern economics: how contentedly and how skilfully people will work – and therefore how successful and fruitful societies can be.</p>
