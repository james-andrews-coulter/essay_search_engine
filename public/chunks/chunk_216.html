            <h3>Learning to be angry</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to believe that one of the dominant problems in the world today is an excess of anger. We know all about the very shouty and their antics: their tantrums, their lack of reason, their unwillingness to compromise. Furthermore, this threatens to get a lot worse. We seem locked into a set of dynamics (political, technological, environmental) that promises an ever less patient, ever less serene and ever less forgiving future.</p>
<p>However, it may be more realistic, albeit odd-sounding, to insist on the opposite: that whatever the impression generated by a publicly vocal angry cohort, the far more common problem is a widespread inability to get angry: a failure to know how to effectively mount a complaint; an inarticulate swallowing of frustration; and the bitterness, subterranean acting out and low-level depression that follow from not expressing our rightful sorrows. For every one person who shouts too loudly, there are at least twenty who have unfairly lost their voices.</p>
<p>We are not talking here of delirious rage – the sort that injures innocents and leads nowhere. The point is not to rehabilitate barbarism; it is to make a case for an occasional capacity to speak up, with dignity and poise, in order to correct a reasoned sense that something isn’t right and that those around us need to take our opposing perspective on board.</p>
<p>As a rule, we are hopeless at being angry, and from the very nicest of motives. In part this stems from a belief in the complexity of situations and the minds of other people, which undercuts enthusiasm for anything that smacks of self-righteousness or pride. We tell ourselves, in relationships or at work, that others must have good reasons for behaving as they do, that they must be essentially kind and good, and that it would be an insult to their efforts to raise our hand about a problem that we surely don’t understand entirely.</p>
<p>We tend to import our modesty from childhood. It is a privilege to allow a child to manifest their frustration – and not all parents are game. Some are keen on having a ‘good’ baby. They let the infant know that being ‘naughty’ isn’t funny and that this isn’t a family where children are allowed to run rings around the adults. Difficult moods and tantrums, complaints and rages are not to be part of the story. This certainly ensures short-term compliance; however, paradoxically, preternaturally good behaviour is often a precursor to bad feelings and, in extremes, mental unwellness in adulthood. Feeling loved enough that one can tell parental figures to sod off and occasionally fling something (soft) across the room belongs to health; truly mature parents have rules and allow their children (sometimes) to break them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is a species of inner deadness that comes from having been forced to be too good too soon and to resign one’s point of view without a flicker of self-defence. In relationships, this might mean a tendency to get taken for a ride for many years – not in terms of outright abuse (though that too), but the kind of low-level humiliation that seems the lot of people who can’t make a fuss. At work, an unwavering concern for politeness, empathy and gentleness may end up providing the perfect preconditions for being walked all over.</p>
<p>We should try to relearn the neglected art of politely being a pain. The danger of those who have never shouted is that they might, in compensation, end up screaming. That isn’t the point either. The goal is a firm but self-possessed protest: ‘Excuse me, but you are ruining what’s left of my life’; ‘I’m so sorry, but you are cauterising my chances of happiness’; ‘I beg your pardon, but this is enough …’</p>
<p>We think a lot about going on holiday and trying new activities. There is a lot of enthusiasm for learning other languages and attempting foreign dishes. But true exoticism and adventure may lie closer to home: in the emotional sphere, and in the courage and originality required to give contained anger a go, perhaps tonight, after supper. We have the speeches written in our heads already. There is likely to be a spouse, a parent, a colleague or a child who hasn’t heard enough from us for far too long, and with whom it would be of incalculable benefit to our heart rate and our emotional and physical constitution to have a word. The timid always imagine that anger might destroy everything good. Because their childhoods encouraged them to, they overlook the fact that anger can also be a fertiliser from which something a lot less bitter and a lot more alive can emerge.</p>
