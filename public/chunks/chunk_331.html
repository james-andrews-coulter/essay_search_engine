        <h3>3 Originality</h3>
<p>For most of history, it was understood that the last thing one needed in an architect was ‘originality’, no more than one needed originality in a carpenter or a bricklayer. The job of an architect was to turn out a building roughly like all the other buildings in a district and to do so politely and on time; it was certainly not to express a distinctive personality, emphasise their differences or make a splash. As a result, most districts of most cities looked very alike. You couldn’t really tell who had done what building and it didn’t matter (just as it doesn’t especially matter who baked a loaf of bread). Architecture was beautifully impersonal and repetitive.</p>
<p>But in the early twentieth century, a troubling idea came to the fore: that the architect was a distinctive individual with a unique vision that needed to be expressed in all its fancifulness in order to appease a restless creative spirit. To ask an architect to fit in with everyone else was as stifling as asking a poet to type out the tax code.</p>

<p>This might have been a liberation for certain architects, but society as a whole has paid an enormous price for this creative release. Suddenly, architects competed to create the most outlandish and shocking forms as if to prove their distinctiveness and worth. It was understood that one could make a name for oneself not by turning out dignified and unassuming buildings but through outrage and peculiarity.</p>
<p>The world forgot that ‘originality’ is as unwelcome in architecture as it would be in bakery or brain surgery. One isn’t looking for constant shock and surprise; one wants predictable rules and harmony. We lost our ability to say that what we really craved was buildings that looked a bit like they had always done; buildings that wouldn’t require one to wonder who designed them.</p>
