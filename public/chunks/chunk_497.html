            <h2>Sun Worship</h2>
<p>In a joking tone, some of us occasionally describe ourselves as ‘sun worshippers’. That can mean that we love to tan, visit an island, go to the beach, read a book, sip a drink and perhaps play volleyball. The problem with this approach is not that we are using too grand a term to refer to what is at heart a rather trivial and almost embarrassing enthusiasm; it’s that we’re arguably making far too little of, and neglecting properly to ritualise or deepen, an orientation that should lie close to the meaning of our lives.</p>
<p>However crowded our beaches may be, in modernity, our love of the sun is for the most part a psychologically shallow and unexplored commitment. Most ancient cultures didn’t merely favour a tan, they worshipped the sun in and of itself, regularly bowing before it as the most potent force in the universe, to which they owed gratitude, obedience and adoration. From their sumptuous sun temples spread out along the length of the Nile, the Egyptians paid homage to the deity Ra (‘sun’), depicted in their sculpture as a falcon-headed god with a solar disc over his head. The Aztecs incanted sacred poetry to Tonatiuh, the sun god and leader of heaven – while the ancient Celts, under less auspicious skies, expressed piety to Grannus, god both of the sun and, appropriately enough, of wisdom.</p>
<p>Science has taught us enough about the constituents of our distant hydrogen and helium explosion for us not to be able to deify the sun in literal terms. But the star can still occupy a place in our symbolic pantheon, where it may hold pride of place as the supreme emblem of something that no life can subsist for long without: hope.</p>
<p>Most of us have only a tenuous hold on our sources of hope. Despair stalks us relentlessly, especially in the darkness of the early hours. There seem, on many days, so many reasons to give up and surrender to self-loathing. This is why the sun is not merely nice, it is an ally in our mind’s constant attempts to structure arguments why it might, after all, be worth keeping going. Maybe there can be an end to the anxiety. Perhaps the project will work out eventually. A lot of things could, in the end, be more or less OK. Such mental explorations the sun seems to reward and generously bolster.</p>
<p>To compensate for our many days of gloom, we should – without any overtly spiritual intent but with a good atheist’s appropriate sense of wonder – practise an exercise of bowing down to the sun, closing our lids against its reviving rays, and reciting all the reasons we might still hold on to hope, despite every argument (too often well-rehearsed at night) why we might give up.</p>
