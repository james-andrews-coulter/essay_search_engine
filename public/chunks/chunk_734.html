        <h3>Good listeners don’t set conditions for listening</h3>
<p>Many of us, when we are being asked for our attention by a partner, promise to give it to them wholeheartedly – but on certain conditions. We say that we will promise to listen to them, but only if they calm down. Or if they decide to be logical. Or if they stop shouting. The request almost makes sense. If one was in a courtroom, a stern judge might well level the same requirements. But this demand for a soft voice, a calm manner and a completely steady mind slyly evades why such ingredients are missing in the first place: the scale of our annoyance with the person we are trying to get through to. To be not only not listened to but also then told that one will never be listened to until the reasons why one can’t speak with utter calm have been addressed becomes a major irritant of its own.</p>
<p>A good listener listens through a storm, even when they are being verbally attacked, even when the partner doesn’t quite make sense, even when they’ve just been called a muttonhead or a cock – and they do so because they keep one key ingredient in mind: the reason why the partner is behaving so unreasonably is fear, and beneath that, love. They are terrified that they have grown dependent on someone who seems, at that moment, to be in some way very unkind, very blocked and very uncomprehending. This may not be true, but this is how it feels and it is the cause of great fear. To up this fear further by insisting on total serenity before a chat can begin is to pour acid into a wound. Good listeners may not want to listen to tantrums, but in the end they do, because they understand very well, and have compassion for, the underlying panicked love that powers them.</p>
