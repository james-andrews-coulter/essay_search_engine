            <h2>PARTIES &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>Going to parties is meant to be an ordinary and unremarkable activity: for the anxious, it typically presents one of the greatest of all of life’s challenges. The idea of being in a noisy room filled with unpredictable and sometimes unknown others sets off every alarm.</p>
<p>To begin to calm ourselves down, we deserve to take full stock of just how weird parties actually are when considered objectively. There is nothing normal at all about being expected to feel at ease when one can be observed by dozens of pairs of eyes; when at any moment a ‘frenemy’ may approach with unwelcome news; when one is expected to feel happy to hear of the good fortune of others; when we have to encounter a random selection of people who may make one feel inadequate and envious…. In evolutionary terms, our brains aren’t well set up to deal with parties. We were made to deal with small groups we might have known since childhood. We are not odd at all for finding parties hugely bizarre and, for the most part, horrifying.</p>
<p>We should dare to push back against the assumption that it is therefore indispensable for us to attend parties. Perhaps we can, going forward, dare to define ourselves as people who just don’t do parties, as others may resist swimming or heights.</p>
<p>We can also question whether this means we are in any way antisocial. Modern society pushes the notion that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room; that it means speaking a lot and being notably cheerful about things that have been happening in our lives; that it depends on a jokey manner and – ideally – on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences. But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. First, perhaps true sociability – that is, a real connection between two people – is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing something that is lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing in an uncensored and frank way a little of the agony and confusion of being alive.</p>
<p>Secondly, true sociability requires honesty. At parties, we are generally under such pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, we are understandably disinclined spontaneously to disclose our true selves. Our default mode is – without anything sinister being meant by this – to lie about who we are and what is really going on in our lives. This suggests that a genuinely social occasion might be rather different from what we typically envisage. We think of a ‘good host’ as someone who makes sure there is enough wine and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other’s names. But, in the profound sense, a good host is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe about being sad, anxious and desperate.</p>
<p>A commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise that we depend on a little artful choreography to get us into the psychological zone in which true connections can unfold. We might need encouragement – and even a helpful lanyard – to share a little of what is sad within us. We need help in networking, not in order to find new investment opportunities, but so as to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair.</p>
<p>Parties as they are currently structured constitute a clever ruse by a sharp minority, perhaps only ten percent of humanity, to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave. But, in truth, it takes a sharply insular and misanthropic person to feel that what goes on in an average party really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one’s fellow human animal. If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches. It doesn’t mean that we don’t like other people, rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact to put up with what is on offer at most parties. The mark of a truly sociable person might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.</p>
