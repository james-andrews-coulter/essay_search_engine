        <h1>5. The Beauty of Conflict</h1>
<p>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</p>
<p>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</p>
<p>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.</p>
<p>(As You Like It, ACT II, SCENE I, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE)</p>
<p>Each species that thrives is well suited to its environment, but this is not a situation that has been arrived at by benign committee. It is the result of violent, unceasing
  conflict.</p>
<p>Parasitoid wasps lay eggs in caterpillars and then paralyse their host with a poison. The wasp eggs hatch within the caterpillar, then slowly begin to eat it, but they like to keep their victim
  alive for as long as possible. They start eating the fatty parts of the caterpillar first, then move on to some of the organs, leaving the central nervous system and heart until last.</p>
<p>Sparrowhawks spear pretty tits, and even those models of outdoors citizenry, trees, devise ingenious manoeuvres to outwit each other, each one responding to the shade of their neighbours as they
  grow. This is not a game.</p>
<p>In 1685 a clan chief from the island of North Rona in the Hebrides returned from time at sea to find that his once-busy home island was desolate. A single lonely and skeletal woman greeted him
  on the beach, and he soon learned that the rest of his people had starved to death. Somehow, black rats had found their way onto the island and into the islanders’ vital food stores. In the
  battle for resources we call winter, the rats had won.</p>
<p>For tens of thousands of years human beings woke in the morning with a simple game plan: win today’s wrestle with nature and tomorrow can take care of itself. Now that we have proved to
  ourselves that we can temporarily beat nature in almost any game, we have been left with strange new challenges and quandaries. Or perhaps this environmental anxiety is nature’s most recent
  cunning ploy: to wrack humans with existential angst so severe that we are eventually pinned down by vines and creepers and then devoured by crows and worse. Time will tell.</p>
<p>We may find conflict unattractive as a concept, repellent even, but as a mechanism for helping us to connect with nature it is so powerful that it holds a beauty. It is not the conflict itself
  that will draw us in, but the inevitability that we will find ourselves rooting for one side. Watching my dog walk around our back garden could get boring. Watching one of our chickens potter in
  one corner of the garden is no more exciting. But running like a maniac to stop my dog from attacking a chicken that has escaped is far from boring.</p>
<p>News of a knife fight in a distant town is less interesting to the average person than hearing that there has been a squabble between two close relatives. It is likely that a ripple in our own
  pond will be more significant to us than a great wave in the wider ocean. The knife fight makes the news, because the news is a collection of intense conflict stories. Even the good news tends to
  be moderated conflict, for instance someone triumphing in a sporting event by thrashing everyone else.</p>
<p>The variable element that will decide whether a tussle draws us in and encourages us to form a connection will be our level of interest in the individuals or teams concerned. The great
  naturalist Aldo Leopold summed this concept up concisely and with a breathtaking political incorrectness, even for 1949: ‘A dead Chinaman is of little import to us whose awareness of things
  Chinese is bounded by an occasional dish of chow mein.’</p>
<p>The nature stories that become best known are the conflicts that resonate most strongly and widely.</p>
<p>Imagine standing at a window in a town and seeing a squirrel climbing a tree. No connection so far. But then you notice that it is unusually red, and this reminds you of one of the best-known
  nature conflicts of our islands.</p>
<p>The grey squirrel was introduced to Britain in 1876. In the early days, they were a rare and welcome sight and they earned lots of fans. Signs appeared in parks with the words, ‘The public
  are earnestly requested not to molest the grey squirrels.’</p>
<p>Leaving to one side for a moment the arresting image of what a squirrel-molester might look like, we move on only forty years to find a very different official stance. Grey squirrels had rapidly
  outcompeted the home side of red squirrels and bred with such vigour that 4,000 were killed in Kew Gardens and the species was deterred from Royal Parks.</p>
<p>The battle for resources continued through the twentieth century. In 1955, reds were spotted in thirty-three parks in Sheffield. By 1965 they were counted in only four, and 1970 was the last
  recorded instance of an urban red-squirrel sighting.</p>
<p>So now . . . imagine you see a red-coloured squirrel climbing a tree from your town window.</p>
<p>There are other recent big nature stories that are also steeped in conflict. Think of the elms that have been whittled away by Dutch elm disease in recent decades and, at the time of writing,
  the fear that the ash trees may be about to go the same way at the hands of the fungal disease that is believed to have come from the continent. We live in interesting times if you are a Europhobic
  arborphile.</p>
<p>The red squirrels and elms have suffered a drastic decline, because they have been confronted with survival challenges and they are yet to arrive at a solution. Evolution is the sadistic
  headmaster of the Succeed-or-Die School of Invention, motto: Disce aut consumere! – ‘learn or get eaten!’.</p>
<p>It is sad and sometimes ugly when a species fails in this school, especially ugly if the change they are confronted with is caused by human thoughtlessness. Sometimes the two happen in tandem
  and ugliness can create unexpected beauty.</p>
<p>New railway lines are notorious for the havoc and destruction they can bring to a landscape, impacting both natural and artificial environments. However, the need to keep general human traffic
  away from the iron dragons that pass along these new lines has created a new habitat and led to a renaissance in rare wildflowers in some areas. But perhaps the most surreal and ironic example of
  this is the fact that many naturalists now support the military’s habit of firing big explosive shells at landscapes. Exploding ordnance falling from the sky has the dependable effect of
  keeping humans away and, consequently, firing ranges from Devon to Scotland have accidentally created some of the most healthy ecosystems in Britain. Naturalists and the military are now working
  more closely, and this unlikely partnership is becoming less accidental and more deliberate.</p>
<p>Danger for humans can spell good news for the rest of nature.</p>
<p>Nothing intensifies our interest in nature like the subject of human influence: for example, economic growth and planning permission versus ancient woodlands and protected birds. Roll up, roll
  up, ringside seats available . . . Be warned, by the second round you will probably want to climb between the ropes and give one side a broken nose. Try thinking of your favourite open space and
  saying the following words dispassionately: ‘My favourite place to go for a walk may not be ideally suited to a new supermarket.’</p>
<p>Some of nature’s most intriguing displays come when a species prevails in the face of an evolutionary challenge. The carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes
  pervillei, lures insects into a fluid-filled cup. There they die in an acid bath. Grotesque, effective and simple, so far, but evolution never stands still. Large insects cause the plant
  problems and foul up its digestive system. There is only one ant that can survive this heinous environment, and it is also the only ant that can swim, the Colobopsis ant. This ant feeds on
  those larger insects that would otherwise cause problems for the plant. Evolution is exquisite: it creates one ant that can not only swim, but chooses to do its lengths in an acid bath that kills
  pretty much everything else its size. Here, the ant serenely eats lunch in the shade provided by its gruesome, murderous host.</p>
<p>Lettuces form a good lunch for many aphids, but once the lettuces realize they are being attacked by the bingeing aphids, they begin to manufacture a poison to deter them. Thus evolution has
  devised a cunning counterattack method for the lettuce. This is great, but wouldn’t it be so much better if the plants could detect an attack by an animal before it was launched?
  Yes, of course, but how could that be possible? The genius of evolution is best seen when it solves problems that humans might struggle with. Think for a moment how you would give a plant a system
  that allowed it to predict that an animal attack was imminent. Bear in mind that plants have no brain.</p>
<p>Scientists have worked out that many plants are able to protect themselves from animal attack by staying finely tuned to the chemicals being produced by other plants. Incredibly, we now know
  that a plant can pre-empt an attack by an animal, long before it has been attacked itself, by ‘chemical eavesdropping’. If a poplar tree picks up the scent of other trees being
  attacked by insects, it produces more of the toxic compounds that inhibit the growth of its enemy, the caterpillar, long before the creatures launch their offensive on that particular tree.</p>
<p>In any closely matched battle, an arms race of ingenuity is likely. One of the most fun examples of this can be found in the tussle between a giant mammal and a tree. Giraffes in Botswana eat
  the leaves of acacia trees. The acacia tree is not keen on being completely devoured, and so releases tannins to deter the giraffes. This chemical messenger is picked up by other trees, which
  pre-empt attack and produce the chemical in anticipation. How do you think the giraffes beat this system?</p>
<p>The giraffes have learned to eat the acacias starting at the downwind end of a group of acacias. What will the acacias ‘think’ of next?</p>
<p>Conflict in the natural world is not limited to organism versus organism. Life for many creatures and plants is a regular battle against the elements, and many animals find particular seasons
  precarious. If, during the lean months, the smallest birds encounter a source of food, they must regulate their intake: too little and they will starve, too much and they lose agility and are
  likely to fall prey.</p>
<p>What will the acacias ‘think’ of next?</p>
<p>The changing seasons mark a constant shift in opportunities and challenges for most species. It is not as simple as ‘summer good, winter bad’. While winter means depleted food and
  harsher weather, many parasites and diseases flourish in the warmth and humidity of summer. Predators and prey find their odds alter with changes in temperature, foliage, food-scarcity, water
  levels, light levels and their own populations. There is a tendency for us to back the underdog when the going is tough, which is probably why it is so exciting to watch prey escaping during such
  times. A fall of snow will make it harder for prey like rabbits to hide; who wouldn’t cheer for a rabbit running over snow ahead of a dog? Not everyone would; that’s what makes it
  interesting.</p>
<p>Animals have numerous systems for warning them of attack by other animals – from the neighbourhood-watch system of birds, who make others of their kind aware of danger with their alarm
  calls, to the small mammals that beat the ground as a warning drum. Nor should we be surprised to find animals and plants communicating with each other about impending battles with the weather.
  Scientists have noted that pine and oak trees emit ultrasonic vibrations during a drought, as their water-bearing vessels respond to the decrease in available water, and it has even been suggested
  that other trees are picking up on these signals somehow.</p>
<p>An appreciation that conflict is an inevitable part of nature can help us to notice and then connect with the supersensitive balance in an area. Any tweak to any variable will tip some species
  into the ascendant and others into trouble.</p>
<p>The constant challenge of survival, the same one our not-so-distant ancestors struggled with, might also be the reason why we abhor excessive violence. There is a difference between the demands
  of survival and gratuitous killing. The fox that systematically slaughters all the chickens and leaves most of them dead, instead of killing and taking just one, makes few friends. The writer Roger
  Deakin was incensed by the squirrels that laid waste to an excessive number of his walnuts, likening them to the thieves that vandalize a home after burgling it: ‘Grow up, act your age. Just
  take what you need and bugger off.’</p>
<p>Noticing the mass conflict around us and finding ourselves taking sides in small battles is an integral part of forming a connection with nature. Anyone who denies this is still waiting to form
  a connection. We can remain impartial from a distance, but the sight of abundant death has a way of triggering a measure of empathy which grows into a connection, and with this comes a strong
  interest in the wellbeing of certain animals or plants. The further away the battles take place, the bigger they need to be for most people to become connected. This is why we hear stories about
  local species, but distant ecosystems.</p>
<p>We may feel moved by the plight of the whole Amazon rainforest or the single rare bird that visited our back yard once. Scale and proximity will have a bearing on which conflicts trigger our
  emotions, but once we take sides it is inevitable that we will feel a connection.</p>
