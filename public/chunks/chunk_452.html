            <h2>Fear and Self-hatred</h2>
<p>In trying to discover the origins of fear, we may need to look in a slightly unobvious place: not in the purported content of our concerns, but instead (a topic we may be very reluctant to consider) in how we feel about ourselves. It may be that certain kinds of worries are, in the end, driven not so much by anything especially alarming in the world as by a compulsive need to find ourselves awful. Our fears may be a leading symptom of self-hatred.</p>
<p>Imagine someone at an airport heading out for a much-deserved and long-anticipated holiday. As they make their way through the check-in process, they start to become increasingly fearful that in their absence, they will be undermined by colleagues and eventually sacked. The thought doesn’t leave them alone and by the time they reach their destination, they are certain that their career is over. Or, imagine someone in the early stages of a hugely satisfying love affair. Their new partner is kind, thoughtful and very funny. But one evening, when this partner is out with friends, the fearful person becomes sure that they are being cheated on; the partner must have met someone else and love is about to fail for them once again.</p>
<p>If we drill into our core, it becomes apparent that many worries are essentially efficient ways of beating ourselves up and of doubting whether we are good enough to deserve anything satisfying and desirable. By worrying, we are finding a highly efficient way of depriving ourselves of the right to be content. Somewhere inside our worried mind is a sense of being an unworthy person. Our fears are plugged into boundless subterranean stores of self-hatred.</p>
<p>If our starting position is one of self-hatred, then we shouldn’t be surprised if we are never able to have a relaxing holiday or a mutually joyful love affair. Sadly, however, our minds don’t come clean about their workings; they don’t draw our attention to their perverse logic. Fears like to insist that they only concern themselves: the bungled email, the rumour, the missed call … But to be so certain that things are about to go wrong for us, at some point in our personal evolution we must have been given a sense that we were unworthy and shameful. We insist that bad things will happen to us because surely bad things must happen to bad people.</p>
<p>This analysis implies that we should stop taking our worries at face value; rather than ruminating without end on each example, we should shift towards a different and more salient topic – we should replace our anxious questions with a single, bolder sideways enquiry: ‘Why can’t I be kinder to myself?’ The most effective way to calm down might be to try to address our feelings of unworthiness rather than seek reassurance for our panic.</p>
<p>We don’t so much have fears to face – we have a deficit of self-love to make up. If we can find a way to feel more loveable, we might discover that the world also feels less fearsome.</p>
