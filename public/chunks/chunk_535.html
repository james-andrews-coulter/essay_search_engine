            <h3>3. Relationships</h3>
<p>Relationships are perhaps our single greatest source of both happiness and suffering. Unlike people in previous ages, we don’t merely seek a partner we can tolerate; we seek someone we can love, usually over many decades, at an intense pitch of desire, commitment and interest. We dream of someone who will understand us, with whom we can share our longings and our secrets, and with whom we can properly be ourselves.</p>
<p>Then the horror begins. We need to understand why. Some of it is because our childhoods leave us with a legacy of trouble around relating to others. We have difficulties trusting or being close, achieving the right distance or staying resilient. We cannot comfortably express what we feel, and are prone to ‘transfer’ a lot of emotions from the past on to present-day scenarios where they don’t quite belong.</p>
<p>We need to chart our own psyches and offer maps of our madness to partners early on, before we have had the chance to hurt them too much with our behaviour.</p>
<p>Our current relationship difficulties stem in part from a cultural source that we call ‘Romanticism’. In the background, we operate with a deeply problematic Romantic picture of what good relationships should be like: we dream of profound intimacy, satisfying sex, an absence of secrets and only a modicum of conflict. This faith in love is touching, but it carries with it a tragic flaw: our expectations turn out to be the enemies of workable mature relationships.</p>
<p>At The School of Life, we are drawn to what we call a Classical approach to love. The Classical view is in certain ways cautious. Classical people pay special attention to what can go wrong around others. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the standard of partners across society and may interpret a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances. This view of people is fundamentally, but usefully, dark. Ultimately, everyone is deeply troubled and hard to live with. The only people we can think of as normal are those we don’t know very well.</p>
