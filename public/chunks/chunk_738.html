        <h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Being ‘diplomatic’ doesn’t sit at all well with our current ideas of what a good relationship should be like; the term sounds fake, hesitant and musty. We like to imagine couples who are always open and frank with one another, who can say directly what they think and feel – whereas the diplomat is someone who softens or bends their words. They’ll say a situation is ‘tricky’ when bombs are exploding or talk of a ‘strained friendship’ in the wake of an attempted assassination. They’re rarely totally honest – they will warmly shake hands with enemies and go to parties with people they privately despise. They can frequently invite accusations of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>But to give the diplomat their due, they operate with a rare and interesting sense of priorities. They care first and foremost about results. They want the other to understand something, but they know that declaring intentions may not be the best way to realise them.</p>
<p>The diplomat operates with a pessimistic picture of the mind. They think of it as a kind of defensive fortress that is set up constantly to repel unwelcome truths. To angrily tell the leader of a hostile nation that they are being stupid and reckless may be to state a truth; but the diplomat knows a tyrant is very unlikely to absorb such a statement calmly, think it through and say: ‘Oh yes, on reflection, I see you do have a point. What do you think I need to do to improve?’</p>
<p>The diplomat is interested in the careful ways in which a truth may need to be presented in order to take up residence in the mind of an averagely confused, agitated and passionate person. Likewise, in the context of a relationship, the diplomatic lover might hold off expressing any of their frustration the moment it occurs in the kitchen past midnight. They will wait until the next day when everyone is rested. They might lay on layers of flattery, they will ask a leading question rather than make a direct accusation and they will couch their assertions in the weaker language of ‘maybe’, ‘perhaps’ and ‘possibly’. This is not at all because they are pathetic, hugely accommodating or conflict-avoidant; it is just that they are particularly determined to get messages through to their partner and are devoted to a realistic theory of how they might succeed.</p>
<p>A key technique of the diplomat–partner is that they try very hard to define what the problem afflicting the couple really is. Emotionally we often totalise: when we get upset, we feel our lover is globally awful, everything about them is horrible – and if emotion could speak directly, it would say: ‘I hate you, this whole relationship is miserable.’ The diplomat, by contrast, focuses on the specific causes of trouble. It isn’t remotely ‘everything’ that is ever really likely to be the problem. By searching for the actual issue, the diplomat can specify a target rather than declare a war.</p>
<p>A second big idea the diplomat embraces is that negotiations might reasonably take some time. They have a sense of how hard it is for the other person to properly embrace any unwelcome idea – and they know that the ground has to be prepared, the issue has to be raised gently at first and accommodation must be made for pushback. But none of this is fatal; they will just take a slightly different tack and keep going. They might be at this for many months. The most distinctive thing about the diplomat is that they are, in the end, hopeful: they are motivated by the idea that a good outcome can be found through the stealthy exercise of their craft.</p>
<p>It is open to us all to practise our diplomatic skills via specific exercises that encourage kindly and productive indirectness.</p>
<p>Rather than being merely sly or underhand, being diplomatic is an act of love; it means generously and kindly attempting to help someone over an incapacity without drawing attention to what we are doing. It is an open-hearted move that knows we all need assistance with the truth and don’t deserve censure for our defences (the person who denies that they ever reject unwelcome truths is only defending themselves against an unwelcome truth). We should proudly be indirect with our partners because there is something extremely direct and honest that we long to do with them through our tentative language: help them grow.</p>
<p>What we might feel</p>
<p>What we might diplomatically say</p>
<p>You don’t give a shit about anyone but yourself.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether you sometimes lose interest in what I am saying.</p>
<p>You’re so disorganised, you’ll never get your career off the ground.</p>
<p>It might be worth trying to think more about priorities.</p>
<p>That jumper is revolting on you.</p>
<p>Burgundy doesn’t quite do you justice.</p>
