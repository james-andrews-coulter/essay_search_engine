            <h2>LOVE &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>As is often the case with anxiety, when it comes to relationships, we have a habit of making potentially somewhat frightening situations far worse by downplaying the challenges that are at play.</p>
<p>A good relationship requires that we take a series of unambiguously daunting steps. We are required to give another person the keys to our affection, to our sense of self and to our power to thrive as autonomous beings. We need to make space for them in our bed, in our friendships and in our routines. Along the way, we cede to them the power to upset us with a slightly offhand remark or late response, and the power to devastate us by deciding to call it a day (let alone by holding the hand of a colleague on a business trip). Our anxieties are compounded by any susceptibility to worry created in our minds by our childhood; perhaps these hold experiences of relationships not working out, of parents who argued viciously in front of us, or separated before we could understand why. We may have grown into adults for whom the spectre of the collapse of a relationship is charged with some of the heightened emotion of a bruised and defenceless child. Our societies focus relentlessly on the upsides of the start of love; we would do well to have some sympathy for the terrors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when we are scared in love, we have vicious tendencies not to recognise the fact in ourselves – and so to make a hash of explaining our fears to others. Rather than gently laying out that we dread the partner’s absence or the occasional insecurity of not knowing quite how they feel about us, we may instead go in for avoidant patterns of behaviour, whereby we claim to be wholly indifferent at precisely the moments when we are most worried and longing for reassurance. Unsure of their love, we insist on our independence – which can provoke them to pull up their drawbridge in turn, initiating a cycle of mutual withdrawal. Or else we may, in the face of our fears of their shifting emotions, try to pin them down procedurally: asking them where they were last night with uncharming suspicion, complaining bitterly if they were a minute late calling us and nagging them to carry out a succession of household chores, which we frame as verdicts on the state of our relationship.</p>
<p>How much better it always is to identify the fear in oneself and share it open-heartedly and guilelessly with our partner. How much more seductive to say ‘I’m frightened of losing you’ than to behave as though one doesn’t care or has turned into a chore-monster. We underestimate the strength we immediately acquire upon admitting that we’re presently feeling very weak.</p>
<p>Of course it is terrifying to be in love; that is, to depend on another person we don’t control for our happiness. We should never make our anxieties worse by being under any illusion that they shouldn’t exist. A contented couple should make regular room, perhaps as often as once a day, for a discussion around the theme of, ‘What scares me about depending on you is…’. That would be the start of a properly relaxing, and loving, way to live.</p>
