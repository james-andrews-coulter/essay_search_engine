            <h2>MERITOCRACY</h2>
<p>For most of history, it was accepted that what happened to people in their lives was, to a critical degree, beyond their control or responsibility. The matter lay in the hands of the gods or of fortune, of luck or, more likely, of rigged odds. No one expected the world to be “fair,” so it was natural to offer sympathy to oneself and others at the inevitable moments of failure.</p>
<p>Modernity has refused to accept this state of affairs. It has fought with unparalleled energy, whether in education, business, politics, or family life, to create a world that can be deemed just, one in which those who deserve to get to the top are able to rise and where rewards are rightfully apportioned to the most deserving candidates.</p>
<p>Though this too may sound like an advance, it carries a nasty sting in its tail, for if one is committed to believing in an order of things whereby those who achieve success invariably deserve to do so, then one is simultaneously signing on to a vision of existence in which those who fail must, with equal fairness, be deserving of their fate. In a meritocracy, an element of justice enters into the distribution of punishment as well as rewards.</p>
<p>The burden of personal responsibility grows exponentially and explains why this age has seen a corresponding increase in rates of suicide, since the blame for a life that has gone awry can only reside narrowly within each of us. We can no longer look elsewhere to explain why we have floundered; we can no longer blame the gods or bad luck. Winners make their own luck, goes the modern mantra, so we must logically also pay the full, unmitigated price for our failures.</p>
<p>ENVY</p>
<p>For most of history, we were protected from the ravages of envy by a class structure that denied most of life’s advantages to all but a narrow and preselected few. Most of us had very little, but we also knew that there was no alternative to penury and that it was therefore not for us to gape with longing and desire at those with finer homes and carriages, horses and titles.</p>
<p>Modernity has freed us from such class-bound strictures. We are repeatedly informed that everyone is born equal and therefore we can and should aspire to the most gilded of lives, comparing ourselves to everyone else in our societies. We no longer believe in innate aristocrats or born peasants; we are runners on a notionally level playing field, able to reach whatever we aim for depending on our investments of imagination and energy. This means that the eventual gaps in social status and material wealth are no longer, as they used to be, an unremarkable feature of the natural order; instead they are a devastating reminder that the good life has eluded our grasp.</p>
<p>It becomes painful and at points intolerable to hear about old school acquaintances who are now scaling the heights while we remain, for causes we cannot overcome, tethered to more lowly stations. We are condemned to perpetual inadequacy in a radically unequal world of self-declared equals.</p>
