        <h4>III. Rebalancing Attitudes to Solitude</h4>
<p>If there is any credibility at all to the somewhat gloomy analysis with which I finished the previous section (and obviously I believe there is), then there is a serious
  problem confronting us, at least in the developed world. We have arrived at a cultural moment when we are terrified of something that we are not reliably, or healthily, able to evade. Solitude can
  happen to anyone: we are all at risk. There is no number of friends on Facebook, contacts, connections or financial provision that can guarantee to protect us. The largest, and fastest-growing,
  groups of people living alone are women over seventy-five (bereavement creates solitude) and men between twenty-five and forty-five (the breakdown of intimate relationships creates solitude). Most
  often, solitude catches people on the hop, as it were, and few of us can feel we will be securely and indefinitely supported by family, neighbourhood, community or even friendship. It is not
  sustainable to live in defensive postures of fear and avoidance all the time.</p>
<p>The two most common tactics for evading the terror of solitude are both singularly ineffective. The first is denigrating those who do not fear it, especially if they claim to enjoy it, and
  stereotyping them as ‘miserable’, ‘selfish’, ‘crazy’ or ‘perverse’ (sad, mad and bad). The second is infinitely extending our social contacts as a
  sort of insurance policy, which makes social media increasingly possible.</p>
<p>The first is ineffective because of the risk that a whole range of circumstances may force someone into solitude involuntarily. Should this happen, the fear-and-projection strategy will turn
  round and bite back: you will be the sad, mad, bad person, and this can only make a difficult situation very much worse. Additionally, since – as you will see – there is a good
  deal of evidence that none of these worries are actually true, people pursuing this route will be obliged to cut themselves off from many ways of knowing about the actual world in which they are
  living. This itself may well prove isolating: one of the problems with projected fears is that they do tend to make the scary thing or event more likely, rather than less likely, to occur.</p>
<p>The problems with the second option are more complex. In the first place, online social life necessarily entails disembodied relationships. Yet we are a culture that places an extremely high
  value on sexual and other physical relationships. We understand the limits of language and have an awareness of how much information is carried by non-linguistic communication – by body
  language, expression and ‘tone’. Relationships without these elements are necessarily partial.</p>
<p>Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, argues that there is a neurological limit to the number of people that most human brains have a capacity to perceive as
  fully developed, complex individuals. Dunbar fixes the number at 150. Michael Hibbert, who claims to have the most Facebook friends in the world, has 8,924. This must, at the very least, change the
  meaning of the word ‘friend’.</p>
<p>In fairness, I should point out that not everyone agrees with me here. There are other reasons for using social media than to generate a plethora of ‘thin’ relationships.</p>
<p>My friend Anne Wareham the garden writer – someone who definitely knows how to be alone and often is – believes that the New Media creates real communities of choice:</p>
<p>When we first came to live in the countryside we knew no one. We spent some lonely years building up friendships and those rarely with really like-minded people. And old
      friends were more difficult to see.</p>
<p>That really was solitude and I remember my frantic efforts to get online when I first heard of the internet and when it wouldn’t have offered much anyway – no one there.</p>
<p>But they are there now, and social media introduces you to people around the whole wide world. With Twitter I have met people who share my particular preoccupation with being serious about
      serious gardens and they are rare – but if you have the world to search you can find like-minded people and they find you. This has also enabled a lively dialogue on the website I edit,
      www.thinkingardens.co.uk.</p>
<p>For someone like me, who values solitude, it’s ideal. I can manage my time and manage my contact with the world, and give real time and effort where and when I choose.</p>
<p>Now I am conscious that my mother-in-law might perhaps need institutional care one day. She is computer literate and therefore of a generation which may no longer find themselves in the
      isolation of an institution full of people with nothing in common but age – because they will have the freedom of the web.</p>
<p>It’s all an enormous luxury and freedom.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I believe our fear of solitude is real and is in many ways disabling. I do not believe that running away from this reality is effective, protective or even socially
  beneficial.</p>
<p>So what follows are ideas for overturning negative views of solitude and developing a positive sense of aloneness and a true capacity to enjoy it. It is not progressive – you do not have
  to do the various exercises in the order I am offering them, but I do suggest that you start with number 1. I recommend starting with the exercises that feel as though they make the most obvious
  sense to you, and which do not seem too stressful.</p>
<p>Although, as I have said, this programme is not progressive, it is cumulative. Like all learning experiences, you need a combination of theory and practice, so I have tried in the pages that
  follow to alternate ideas that might strengthen your desire for and reduce your fear of solitude with ways in which you might, in practice, develop your taste for and skill at it.</p>
