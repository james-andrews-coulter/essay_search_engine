        <h4>I CAN’T TAKE YOUR SUCCESS</h4>
<p>When your friendship began, your situations were similar; you were both studying or taking the early, uncertain steps in your careers; your hopes and anxieties didn’t look too different; you lamented the foibles of your respective bosses; you went on holiday together for a week and had a great time staying in a rundown hotel and searching out places you could eat in for almost nothing.</p>
<p>But for a while things have been going strikingly well for your friend around work. They don’t go on about their success but it keeps on being evident: they invite you to their house-warming party and their new apartment is conspicuously elegant; they ask your advice about a presentation they’re giving – and it’s obviously at a much more impressive conference than any you’d be asked to. Instead of feeling pleased for them you resent their success. Thinking of them makes you feel your life has stalled; in a dark – but insistent – part of your mind you secretly wish they could get the sack or discover that their partner was having an affair.</p>
<p>There’s plenty you still like about this person but it’s swamped by your feelings about their success. If you don’t resolve this, you’ll drift apart. But even if you never see them again, they’ll still haunt your imagination.</p>
<p>It’s probably not going to help if you dramatically confront them with a candid statement of your resentment. It’s not that you want to make them painfully aware that their success disturbs you: there isn’t much they can do with this information, except feel very sorry that this difficulty has emerged between you. They didn’t build their success in order to humiliate you.</p>
<p>But there are some more oblique strategies that could help.</p>
<p>→I’ve been feeling rather frustrated with my own progress – I think it’s partly prompted by seeing how amazingly you’ve been getting on.</p>
<p>We tend to assume that only we could possibly perceive our own envy – and that others will be in the dark. But envy is one of the most transparent of all emotions. Rather than wait for it to be discovered, better to name it oneself, suggest that one has some distance from it – and gain a victory over the shame.</p>
<p>→As you can imagine, I’ve been kicking myself – and going quietly green. But that’s ridiculous, I know. I wonder if there’s something I should be doing that I’m not seeing? If you were in my shoes, what do you think you might do?</p>
<p>A key to dealing with envy is to realise that one doesn’t really want someone else’s life; one just wants to make a few strategic changes to one’s own. Instead of trying to repress our envy, we should henceforth make every effort to study it. Each person we envy possesses a piece of the jigsaw puzzle depicting our possible future. There is a portrait of a ‘true self’ waiting to be assembled out of our envious pangs. We should calmly ask one essential and redemptive question of all those we envy: ‘What could I learn about here?’</p>
<p>→I’ve been thinking quite a lot about envy recently: maybe it’s one of those things we all feel. But I’m curious: who do you feel envious of?</p>
<p>Because every life is incomplete, it is entirely logical that your friend must feel envy too. Without being dark or cruel, it’s helpful to hear who they might be envious of: it restores a degree of equality and might even remind you that there are people who will right now be envying you.</p>
<p>→I’d be fascinated to hear about the kinds of difficulty you face with the work you’re doing. I imagine it’s a bit like climbing a mountain; the higher up you get, the harder it becomes.</p>
<p>You’re getting them to share the less appealing aspects of their success (you can all too easily imagine the nice aspects): the risks, the pressure, the fact that nothing is ever quite enough. Another person’s life – however burnished it might appear on the outside – is sure to contain a full measure of confusion, worry, conflict, disappointment and self-criticism. It’s not gossipy or mean to want to understand how things truly are for others ahead of us. If we can get to understand what’s not so good about their lives, we can get a better perspective on our own situation. We’re not making a fair comparison when we see all the troubles of our own life but only the external accomplishments of theirs. We might – strangely – have a number of things to feel very grateful for.</p>
