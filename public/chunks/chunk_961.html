        <h3>3When we realise we are crazy</h3>
<p>This is deeply counter-intuitive. We seem so normal and mostly so good. It’s the others who are the crazy ones.</p>
<p>But maturity is founded on an active sense of one’s own folly. One is out of control for long periods; one has failed to master one’s past; one projects unhelpfully; one is permanently anxious. One is, to put it mildly, an idiot.</p>
<p>If we are not regularly and very deeply embarrassed by who we are, it can only be because we haven’t begun to understand our own narrative.</p>
