        <h1>The Daily Temperature Reading</h1>
<p>Here is an exercise that may help you get more emotional honesty into your relationships. Created by the family therapist Virginia Satir, it is designed to improve your existing relationships; you’ll need to persuade your family, friends or work colleagues to do this exercise with you. It is called the Daily Temperature Reading because it takes the temperature of a particular relationship in the here and now. There is a belief that true love, great friendships and good working relationships just happen naturally. Often they do, but this exercise can help the process. It offers ways of confiding in other people, and confiding is an essential element in all kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>First, set aside half an hour when you will not get interrupted. Turn off your phones, computers, televisions. If there are two of you, sit facing each other. If you are a group, sit where you can all see each other. Take a minute or two to contemplate how you feel about yourself and your partner or the group. Like an agenda for a meeting, you have a list of five topics to get through. Try not to stray onto different subjects. The topics are: i) Appreciations; ii) New Information; iii) Questions; iv) Complaints with Recommendations for Change; and v) Wishes, Hopes and Dreams.</p>
<p>Appreciations</p>
<p>Take turns to share what you appreciate about each other. Be specific and precise. So instead of saying, for instance, ‘I love being with you’, be specific about what it is you love. For example, ‘I love the way you ring me at midday to see how I am. It makes me feel cared for.’ When you receive an appreciation, do not argue with it, or bat it back, or immediately say something like, ‘Oh, and you too’, because this will take away from its impact. Never put a ‘but’ on an appreciation, or try to sneak in a complaint by saying, for example, ‘I would appreciate it if you would …’ Reserve this section for sharing just what you appreciate about each other. You can decide between yourselves how many turns you wish to take to express appreciation.</p>
<p>New Information</p>
<p>This section is about sharing the events of your lives as well as being open about your moods, feelings and thoughts and about what is affecting them. It is important to keep one another up to date about what is happening to you. This section is for sharing objective information, such as, ‘I have a dental appointment tomorrow’, and subjective information such as, ‘When I lost a tooth yesterday I felt so melancholy, it felt like the beginning of old age. Then I became more hopeful when I realized I still have time left.’ The point is to say what is in the foreground for you, and keep it real, even if you have not worked out exactly what it is you are feeling and thinking. It is about not only keeping others informed of new facts but keeping them up-to-date on how you are working things out and what meanings you are making or trying to make. If there is time and if it seems appropriate, you can tell one another how you experienced hearing the information they have shared, or you can simply acknowledge it with a ‘thank you’ or a nod. If you have observations about what they have said, do not define the other person by making ‘you’-statements. You could say, ‘I have noticed you say you are sad when …’ but not, ‘You are always sad when …’ Confine your statements to ‘I’-statements, not ‘you’-statements.</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>What assumptions are you making about your partner or the other people in the group? This is the moment to examine those assumptions. For example, you might say, ‘The door slammed when you left the room yesterday. Were you angry or did the wind catch the door and slam it?’ When I work with couples I often find that problems arise because they do not examine their own assumptions. Examining our assumptions and checking them out with our partner ensures that we have a relationship with the person instead of a fantasy of them, or avoid falling into the sort of ‘I–I’ relationship I spoke of earlier. This section is an opportunity to examine your assumptions and ask any type of question. These might be something as mundane as, ‘What time are we leaving tomorrow?’ or as pertinent as, ‘I have experienced you as down and distant this week. Is anything going on?’ Asking questions does not mean you will get answers, although you might. It is important to be patient with each other and to foster goodwill. Your question provides information for the other or others as well as being a question in its own right. There is no obligation to answer a question. If you wish, you can merely thank the other for their question, without answering it.</p>
<p>Complaints with Recommendations for Change</p>
<p>Complaints or worries should only be aired in conjunction with a suggestion for how that complaint or worry might be addressed. Without attacking, blaming, name-calling, playing the victim, interpreting or criticizing, describe the behaviour that causes you concern and then explain how it makes you feel (not think). Then say what you would like done differently. When you receive a complaint try simply to listen. Do not defend yourself. You do not have to alter your behaviour, although you may choose to. It is not differences that cause problems in relationships but how we deal with those differences. Because of our background and conditioning our response to hearing a complaint about ourselves can be defensive. When a response to someone’s concern or complaint exacerbates the situation, the likelihood of a fully functioning relationship is decreased. It may help to remember when you receive a complaint that it is only nominally about you; it is really information about the person making the complaint. When we are able to work through qualms and complaints we can become closer through our successful navigation of the challenge they represent. When someone we love shares a concern, it is vital to develop the habit of listening with empathy and with a desire to understand. An example could be, ‘When you come in from work and immediately start relating your day, my train of thought is interrupted, I forget what I was doing and I feel overwhelmed. What I would like would be for you to check in with what I’m doing and let me wrap that up, or mark my place and where I have got up to, and then I really want to hear about your day.’ The other might respond with something like, ‘I never realized, thank you for letting me know. Just put your hand up to say stop if I’m overwhelming you again.’ Other complaints might be more tricky to hear, such as, ‘I’m sick of being the person who puts the rubbish out in this house; I want you to do it for a change.’ This complaint is expressed with a martyr-ish edge. It might have been better to phrase it as follows: ‘As I put the bins out last night, it felt to me as though I am the only person who remembers to do this. Please could you do it next time?’ The person on the receiving end may have been about to deliver the very same complaint because they feel that they are always left with this chore. Remember: the complaint is about the person making it. The best way to respond is, ‘I hear that you feel that it is you who always takes the rubbish out, and you would like to change. Thank you for telling me.’ It is best not to argue when you do this exercise. When you next do a Daily Temperature Reading, in the questions section you might say, ‘It seems to me we both feel we are doing more than our fair share of chores. Perhaps we need to work out a system or get a cleaner. What do you think?’ Remember, the idea is not to fight, and a good relationship is not about determining who is right and who is wrong. It’s about finding a way forward together. A common intervention that psychotherapists make when working with couples is to say, ‘You can choose between being right, or being together’. As I’ve said before, bear this in mind if you feel wrongly accused: the accusation is about how the other person feels and they will not feel better if they are made to feel wrong as well.</p>
<p>Wishes, Hopes and Dreams</p>
<p>Some people hold on to a belief that telling others of the things they really want will jinx the dream. In my experience the opposite is more often true. I advocate the sharing of wishes, hopes and dreams in order to get the support and encouragement we need to fulfil them. Before a race an athlete visualizes how he will jump every hurdle and cross the line at the end of the race. He may not win as a result of his visualizing exercise, but he gives himself a better chance of doing so – and so will you, as you share your hopes with others. Sharing our deepest hopes can make us feel vulnerable, so support your partner(s) in this endeavour, rather than challenging them. Sharing our vulnerabilities increases intimacy and deepens the connections between us.</p>
<p>The Daily Temperature Reading can be important to couples, families, work teams and others. To give it a chance, do it, say, every two days for a month as a couple, or weekly for two months as a group. Then evaluate what difference it has made in your lives.</p>
<p>Think about these five modes of communication – appreciating; informing; questioning; complaining and recommending; and sharing your wishes, hopes and dreams – and how you use them outside of the Daily Temperature Reading, in your everyday exchanges. Do you use one mode more often than others? If so, consider using a mode that is not as familiar to you, in order to broaden your range of communication. Think of these five categories, as well, in juxtaposition with Martin Buber’s descriptions of types of communication: ‘genuine dialogue’, ‘technical dialogue’ and ‘monologue disguised as dialogue’. We can make it a goal to make more of our communicating count.</p>
