        <h2>SEX &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>The anxieties of love may be compounded by even more tortured feelings around sex – another topic about which we are expected, implausibly, not to be scared.</p>
<p>But how foolish to assume that it might not be anything other than very complicated to take one’s clothes off in front of someone and attempt to make love with them. Far from being the uninhibited and liberated free spirits that the adverts suggest we all are, many of us bear important legacies of shame around the expression of our sexualities.</p>
<p>Our capacity to express our sexual selves confidently and happily, our ability to say what we want and to ask for it without embarrassment, are enormous psychological achievements. They are also generally only available to those among us who enjoyed highly supportive and emotionally evolved early environments. For us to be sexually untroubled adults requires that, way back, others will have left us feeling acceptable to ourselves: enjoying a sense that our bodies and their functions were natural and fine things, that we were not naughty or sinful for expressing curiosity about ourselves and that it was (for example) more than a good idea to be, at the age of two, properly delighted by the strange and wondrous existence of one’s own bottom.</p>
<p>Sexual desire is one of the most personal and vulnerable things that we are ever called upon to express – and it exposes one to potentially momentous degrees of ridicule. As bullies of all kinds have always known, if you want to destroy someone fast, shame them about their sexuality; they’ll never have the self-confidence to challenge you again. There are few things more deeply ‘us’ than our longing for sexual connection; therefore, any feelings of unworthiness – any worries about how nice we are, how deserving we may be or how legitimate it is that we exist – have a sure habit of cropping up in the bedroom and of destroying our ability to be straightforward and unconflicted sexual beings. To generalise crudely, if there is any danger of us feeling bad about ourselves, we’re going – by a psychological inevitability – to feel bad about ourselves and sex. What get called sexual problems – impotence, vaginismus, lack of desire, harmful addictions – are, first and foremost, always problems of self-hatred. And one can’t, as a rule, both hate oneself and be having a terrific time in bed.</p>
<p>Beginning to repair the problem of sexual shame relies on a basic acceptance that the problem exists and can play havoc with our lives. We need to learn to name and track the matter; despite suggestions to the contrary, a lot of us, women and men, are right now walking the earth intensely ashamed of ourselves sexually – not because what we want sexually is in any objective way ‘bad’ (that is, disgusting or willingly hurtful to someone else), but because our histories have predisposed us to feel so negatively about our own selfhood.</p>
<p>A central effect of sexual shame is to silence us. We are so embarrassed that we cannot even speak of our embarrassment. It is of huge importance therefore to dare to put our feelings into words and to seek out warm-hearted, broad-minded people with whom we can, in safety, finally admit to our inhibitions – and learn to see ourselves through eyes that are not biased, judgemental or uncaring.</p>
<p>To take a measure of how much shame we are carrying within us, we might along the way ask ourselves a few poignant questions to which we might not have pleasant answers:</p>
<p>How do you feel about your own body?</p>
<p>How sorry do you have to feel for a person having sex with you?</p>
<p>Could someone know you sexually, properly know you, and still like you?</p>
<p>In a caring, mutually supportive environment, our acceptance of our sexuality is one of the most generous and mature acts we’re capable of. We – the ashamed ones – deserve to rediscover sex not as a zone of guilt and anxiety but as an intensely fulfilling, innocent and, in the profound sense, ‘fun’ pastime, something we truly deserve to enjoy in the same way that, despite early intimations to the contrary, we truly deserve to exist.</p>
