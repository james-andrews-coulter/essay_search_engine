<p>If modern news organisations had reported on the stories of Othello or Oedipus, we can only imagine with what self-righteousness the headline writers would have set to work. ‘Love-crazed immigrant kills senator’s daughter’; ‘Sex with mum was blinding!’ We might chuckle darkly at the absurdity of dragging elevated characters like these into the newsroom, as if there was something inherently superior about their stories that would make them unfit for the tabloid writer’s pen, but in reality there is nothing about these legendary figures of art that is any different from the wretched characters whom the media inform us about on a daily basis. The only reason why they seem different is that Sophocles and Shakespeare insisted on treating them as rounded humans rather than one-dimensional monsters. Had they, and other great writers (Racine, Tolstoy, Fitzgerald, Eliot, Woolf and so on), had the chance to set to work on the news stories of today, then we would find that there are as many people to weep over, sympathise with and feel pity for today as there were in the canon of Greek or Elizabethan theatre, or the pages of Russian or French literature. Whatever the technical capacities of the authors of tragedies, what is ultimately most impressive is their moral capacity; their ability to look beneath the obvious markers of ‘evil’ or ‘failure’ and to detect the human being beneath the murderer, the child within the prisoner, the wise person behind the lunatic. In reality, as these great writers insist to us, there is no such thing as a monster – apart from in the imagination of news organisations and our own over-hasty condemnations. When the media takes care to impress on us that they are telling ‘the truth’, our consciences should start to signal loudly that something is amiss. We cannot be being told the truth at all. Wherever it is too easy to hate and to mock, the truth has gone missing.</p>
<p>We can put this theory to the test in even the most extreme cases. Let us imagine we come across a story on a news website entitled, ‘Weirdo doc guilty of downloading sick porn images’. The news tells us: A depraved doctor from Sunderland who downloaded more than 1,300 extreme sex images, including scenes of torture and animal cruelty, has been sentenced and jailed for five years. Police found the sickening images on the laptop of Bill Scotch, 34, from Dainsdale Avenue. The doctor, who worked at the town’s hospital as a surgeon, earlier admitted to looking at the filthy images. He was sentenced unanimously by the jury and taken away in handcuffs from court.</p>
<p>Initially, the case seems clear. This man is a devil, and it would be best to lock him in a faraway cell and throw away the keys. But so much of how we respond to people’s failure depends on how their story is told. In reality, we would be capable of sympathising with, and feeling sorry for, pretty much anyone – so long as their story was narrated to us in a particular way. As an extreme example, if it were told to us in the way that a visiting angel, Jesus or the Buddha might tell it.</p>
<p>News organisations tend to worry about generating sympathy because they do not trust their audiences to juggle two ideas: that someone could have done a terrible thing for which they will have to spend time in prison – and at the same time, that this person remains a human being. The news can’t seem to trust that we might be capable of such two-tiered thinking. Either we have to hate everyone who does anything wrong and then feel happy about their punishment, or else we might see them in more rounded ways and would call for all prison doors to be flung open.</p>
<p>In order to protect us from moral complexity, the news rushes its stories – for the more compressed an account, the less our emotions can be nuanced. It’s always the headline that attracts most outrage, while it’s no coincidence that the great tragic plays tend to last a few hours and the tragic novels for 400 pages. The more one knows, the harder it is to ridicule and condemn. Even with the bestial doctor, the more we read, the more our emotions might shift:</p>
<p>Condemning the man to his cell, the judge remarked: ‘You have thrown away your whole life for the sake of a few hours of gratification. You deserve to be ashamed of yourself forever.’ Hearing this, the doctor threw himself on the ground and started wailing – and had to be picked up by the guards. The police informed the court that the man had at first denied downloading the images, then tried to stab himself in the kitchen while officers were upstairs. His wife of three years has taken away their newborn son and asked for a divorce. His own family have disowned him.</p>
<p>Even though we are genuinely horrified by what the doctor has done, it is hard not to shudder when we think of how seven years of medical school, a PhD in a top university and endless hours of work have come to this. An update to the story informs us that the man twice tried to take his life in prison.</p>
<p>None of this is any easier to bear than the plot line of Antigone or Phèdre; we’re simply not used to applying a morally complex lens to the figures we are confronted with in the news or to the lives around us. We need to remember the tragic perspective of love, tolerance and forgiveness – both for others and for ourselves, the day we fail.</p>
