        <h2>FIRST READING</h2>
<p>The failings of our partners can be deeply galling. We look upon their faults and wonder why they are the way they are.</p>
<p>At moments of particularly acute agitation, we need to rehearse an idea called the Weakness of Strength. This dictates that we should always strive to see our partner’s weaknesses as the inevitable downside of certain merits that drew us to them, and from which we will benefit at other points – even if none of these benefits are apparent at present. What we are seeing are not their faults, pure and simple, but rather the shadow side of things that are genuinely good about them. We’re picking up on weaknesses that derive from strengths.</p>
<p>In the 1870s, when he was living in Paris, the American novelist Henry James became a good friend of the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who was also living in the city at that time. Henry James was particularly taken by the unhurried, tranquil style of the Russian writer’s storytelling. He obviously took a long time over every sentence, weighing different options, changing, polishing, until – at last – everything was perfect. It was an ambitious, inspiring approach to writing.</p>
<p>But in personal and social life, these same virtues could make Turgenev a maddening companion. He’d accept an invitation to lunch; then – the day before – send a note explaining that he would not be able to attend; then another saying how much he looked forward to the occasion. Then he would turn up – two hours late. Making arrangements with him was a nightmare. Yet his social waywardness was really just the same thing that made him so attractive as a writer. It was the same unwillingness to hurry; the same desire to keep the options open until the last moment. This produced marvellous books – and dinner party chaos. In reflecting on Turgenev’s character, Henry James reflected that his Russian friend was exhibiting the ‘weakness of his strength’.</p>
<p>Every strength that an individual possesses brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Every virtue has an associated weakness. Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person.</p>
<p>This should subtly alter the way we see the defects and weakness of our partners. Our minds tend to hive off the strengths and see these as essential, while deeming the weaknesses freakish superfluities; in truth, the weaknesses are part and parcel of the strengths.</p>
<p>We must overcome the unhelpful idea that – if only we looked a little harder – we would find an unbroken soul. If strengths are invariably connected to failings, there won’t be anyone who is remotely flawless. We may find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses. Human beings are not made for, and therefore should never aspire to, perfection.</p>
