        <h2>21. IS IT OKAY TO COMPROMISE?</h2>
<p>We reserve some of our deepest scorn for couples who stay together out of compromise; those who are making a show of unanimity, but who we know are not fully happy. Maybe they’re together because of the children; maybe they’re sticking around because they’re scared of being lonely; maybe they’re just worried that anyone else they found wouldn’t be much better.</p>
<p>These seem like disgraceful motives to be with anyone – disgraceful on account of a background belief that circulates powerfully through the collective modern psyche: that there are painfree, profoundly fulfilling options available for all of us, and the only things that could stand in the way of discovering them would be laziness and cowardice, flaws of character that deserve no particular sympathy or forgiveness. Our Romantic expectations have made us impatient around, and censorious about, those who can’t attain them.</p>
<p>But imagine if we were to tweak the premise of the argument a little and, for a moment, probe at the notion that there really might be a pain-free and fulfilling option available for all of us at all times. What if our choices were, in fact, rather more limited than Romanticism proposes? Maybe there aren’t as many admirable, unattached people in our vicinity as there might be. Maybe we lack the charm, the personality, the career, the confidence or the looks ever to attract the ones that do exist. Maybe time is running out. Or maybe our children would take it badly if we dynamited the family for the sake of better sex and greater cheer elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the same time, maybe the current situation – although a compromise – has some virtues. A partner may be only half right, quite often maddening and properly disappointing in certain areas, but – crucially – a vital companion in others. Having children to bring up together may be worth it even with a co-parent about whom one has a long, only semi-private, list of reservations. A few cuddles, occasional moments of cosiness and shared history may retain a small but decisive edge over conclusive abandonment interspersed with humiliating dates.</p>
<p>The capacity to compromise is not always the weakness it is sometimes described as being. It can involve a mature, realistic admission that there may simply be no ideal options in certain situations. Conversely, an inability to compromise does not always have to be the courageous and visionary position it is held to be by our impatient and perfectionist ideology: it may just be a slightly rigid, proud and cruel delusion.</p>
<p>Mocking people who compromise is, of course, emotionally handy. It localises a problem that it is normal to want to disavow. It pins to a few scapegoat couples what we fear in our relationships: that a degree of sadness may just be an intrinsic and unavoidable part of them.</p>
<p>Wiser societies would be careful never to stigmatise the act of compromise. It is painful enough to have to compromise; it is even more painful to have to hate oneself for having done so. We should rehabilitate and occasionally honour the ability to put up with a flawed fellow human being, to nurse our sadness without falling into rage or despair, to reconcile ourselves to our damaged appearance and character and to accept that there may be no better way for us to live but partly in pain and longing, given who we are and what the world can provide. Couples who compromise may not, in reality, be the sworn enemies of love; they may be at the vanguard of understanding what staying the course in a relationship can demand.</p>
