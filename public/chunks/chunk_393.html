        <h2>7. Train the Children</h2>
<p>I have already discussed Anthony Storr’s book Solitude. I particularly like the way he sees children as tough, as natural survivors, capable of turning even
  quite dark experiences into creative and nourishing channels. Richard Louv’s book Last Child in the Woods (Atlantic, 2009) is an impassioned plea for children to be allowed more
  experience of solitude, particularly outside in wilder places. The book is annoyingly American in some ways (there is rather a lot of pop-psychology), but his evidence is thoroughly marshalled and
  the ‘child’ he describes seems to be much more realistic and attractive than the hyper-delicate, endangered, brittle child of too many child experts’ fantasies. Like me, he sees
  many of the problems that children are currently suffering as related to their lack of solitude – and he uses sociological and psychological research to prove the case; he is particularly
  persuasive on ADD (attention deficit disorder). Tim Gill, in No Fear (Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2007), takes a similar line in a more European context. It is on these books and
  others that I base my opinion that a lack of solitude – and especially solitude out of doors – is one cause of our children’s problems.</p>
<p>Both Philip Pullman and Jack Zipes have published modern translations of the Grimm Brothers’ collected fairy stories. I find these better for children than modern retellings, where too
  often the fear of being alone (along with any parental shortcomings) is written out to ‘protect’ the child.</p>
<p>Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak, a picture book for very young children, is one of the best starting places for this sort of literature. It manages to be both funny and
  serious, the pictures are fabulous and the ‘hero’ victorious through his own courage.</p>
