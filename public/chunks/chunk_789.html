        <h2>IMPOSTOR SYNDROME</h2>
<p>Related to such symptoms will be a continuous feeling, while at work, that we are about to be unmasked as not up to the job that we are claiming to know how to carry out. Whatever our technical competence or years of experience, our emotional state will imbue us with a conviction that we do not deserve the respect and trust of those who depend on us. The gap between what we are claiming to be and what we suspect we deep down are will lead to an increasing sense of anxiety and dread. We may fear being suddenly and publicly unmasked, denounced anonymously or humiliated at a time of our colleagues’ and enemies’ choosing. Paranoid thoughts will haunt us; we may have moments of blind panic and be unable to speak in public. In the end, it can feel easier to fail and so prove our inner voices right rather than continue to defy our latent self-suspicion.</p>
