            <h4>1. Consciousness of the Self</h4>
<p>In his excellent and informative book From the Holy Mountain (Flamingo, 1998), William Dalrymple tells a delightful and revealing little story. Dalrymple was staying
  with a Coptic monk in the Egyptian desert, and he questioned the hermit about his motivation for choosing such an austere lifestyle.</p>
<p>‘Many people think we come to the desert to punish ourselves, because it is hot and dry and difficult to live in,’ said Father Dioscuros. ‘But it’s
      not true. We come because we love it here.’</p>
<p>‘What is there to love about the desert?’</p>
<p>‘We love the peace . . . You can pray anywhere. After all, God is everywhere, so you can find him everywhere. But in the desert, in the pure clean atmosphere, in the silence –
      there you can find yourself.’</p>
<p>Exactly what this ‘self’ might be remains, of course, the continuing philosophical (and psychological and spiritual and intellectual) question. If the self
  is just ‘me’, how can ‘I’ lose it – or for that matter find it? Nonetheless, over and over again people write of solitude that it allows them to
  ‘re-gather’ a sense of self that can get ‘scattered’. Oliver Morgan, quoting from Koch’s Solitude (see Homework for details), uses the image explicitly:</p>
<p>I can sense that my ‘person’ is pulling back from its scattering into the details and plans of today, like a wave rolling from sand and shore back to its ocean
      source – collecting itself into a unity of ‘ocean’. ‘I’ am here, present to myself and available for a possible revelation of what is inside me . . . I am present
      too for experiences of those guiding, inner images (personal metaphors, archetypes) that I sense shape my values, actions, judgements and decisions during the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Thomas Merton, from a religious angle, sees this process as morally necessary:</p>
<p>All men need enough solitude in their lives to enable the deep inner voice of their own true self to be heard at least occasionally. When that inner voice is not heard,
      when he cannot attain to the spiritual peace which comes from being perfectly at one with his true self, his life is always miserable and exhausting . . . If a man is constantly exiled from his
      own home, locked out of his own solitude, he ceases to be a true person.</p>
<p>But you do not need to be so grandiose about this business of knowing the self; it is not just a truth for reflective philosophers or great minds. It can be quite domestic and
  ordinary. Here my friend Jill Langford describes what joy solitude gives her and how she goes about getting it in a very busy life:</p>
<p>About twenty-five years into my marriage, with seven children, I asked my husband for a one-man tent for Christmas. A little taken aback, perhaps, he nonetheless granted my request and bought me a super little army tent or bivouac shell that you honestly couldn’t squeeze two people into. You erect
      it, quite easily and quickly, crawl in on your belly, then turn over onto your back, clutching a sleeping bag, raise your knees and wriggle your legs, then bottom, then torso into it. Et
      voilà. You stay in that position till morning, then you do the same in reverse. There is no room to sit up and you’d be a fool not to have a wee before retiring, since the whole
      procedure is well-nigh impossible in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I use this little tent just whenever I feel the need to take off, alone, for whatever reason. For me, it works like a battery charger when I feel weighed down by the burdens of living in
      community and am dragging my feet. Actually I don’t use it very much, but knowing it’s there to use if I want to is sometimes enough in itself to bring a spring back into my
      step.</p>
<p>When I do need to use it, I find it best to have a car handy, since there is nowhere to store any kit inside the tent and in my part of Scotland it’s usually raining. The car is good
      because it gets you far from home quickly, so no one will come tramping across the fields to find you until you are done with being alone. This usually takes two full days, but a single night
      would be better than nothing.</p>
<p>The first morning, emerging from your bivouac-thing, there is a great sense of joy and freedom. You feel quite alone in the world and no one knows who you are or why you are there. You could
      be in a campsite surrounded by happy families or out in the wild woods with silent, dumb creatures that creep and crawl. It makes no difference, the point is that you are alone because you
      wanted it this way. You don’t talk to a soul the whole time. You just get up, brew a coffee on a camping stove and then zip up the tent and go. It doesn’t really matter where you go
      either. You know that you have about twelve hours ahead of you just to yourself. So you start walking, along the coast, up a hill, by a river, down a valley, anywhere, on and on, stopping every
      now and then for a banana and a drink (massive water bottle) and a sit.</p>
<p>It feels good. You find yourself skipping, no, gambolling, like a newborn lamb. In your head, details about daily life swiftly give way to songs, hymns you used to know, praise, yes praise,
      for God’s mind-blowing creation. Your thoughts then turn to God because there aren’t any people about and you find yourself chatting amicably with Him. Sometimes there are tears,
      sobbing even, but this comes with emptying. It’s really all about emptying. And then, renewal. This is what we miss if we don’t empty stuff.</p>
<p>By nightfall, the little tent and sleeping bag beckon: you greet them both joyfully and shut down. Usually it’s freezing and sleep comes in patches, but the night time wakefulness is
      all part of it. You use it to set things straight, mentally.</p>
<p>Another day ahead, more wanderings, then hunger sets in and you head for home, refreshed.</p>
<p>This sort of experience, this kind of rediscovery of one’s own self and its unique delights, just on its own seems a good reason for experimenting with a little solitude:
  if nothing else, it is a great deal cheaper than a therapist!</p>
