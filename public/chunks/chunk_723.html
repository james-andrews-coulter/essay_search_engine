        <h2>TRAUMA &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>Anxiety belongs in every life. But in some lives, we can fairly say that it has become so constant that it is unnecessarily punishing. What can explain persistent, high-level anxiety that goes far beyond ordinary worry?</p>
<p>We might venture that somewhere in the history of the constantly worried, the bit of our mental equipment designed to distinguish between modest and extreme danger has taken a hit. The very worried have – somewhere along the line – received such a fright that pretty much everything has now grown frightening. Every slightly daunting challenge becomes a harbinger of the end; there are no more gradations. The party where one knows no one, the speech to delegates, the tricky conversation at work…these put the whole of existence into question. Pretty much every day is a crisis.</p>
<p>Let’s go in for a metaphor. Imagine that at a formative moment, when the very anxious would have been profoundly unprepared and without the resources to cope, they had an encounter with a bear. The bear was beyond terrifying. It raged, it stamped, it crushed. It threatened to destroy everything; it was incomprehensibly, mind-defyingly awful. As a result, the anxious person’s inner alarm jammed into the ‘on’ position and has stayed stuck there ever since. There is no use casually telling this person that there aren’t any bears around at the moment, that this isn’t the season, that most bears are kind or that campers rarely encounter them; that’s easy for you to say, you who were never woken up by a giant grizzly staring at you with incisors showing and giant paws held open for the kill.</p>
<p>The result of this bear encounter is an unconscious commitment to catastrophic generalisation; the very anxious fear all bears, but also all dogs, rabbits, mice and squirrels, and all campsites and all sunny days, and even associated things, like trees rustling in the wind, or prairie grass, or the smell of coffee that was being made shortly before the bear showed up. The very anxious can’t do logical distinctions: They can’t rank threats accurately.</p>
<p>To start to dig ourselves out of the quicksand of worry, we – the very, very anxious – need to do something that is likely to feel artificial and probably rather patronising too. We need to learn – on occasion – to distrust our senses completely. These senses, which are mostly terrific guides to life, have to be seen for what they also are: profoundly unreliable instruments, capable of throwing out faulty readings and destroying our lives. We need to erect a firm distinction between feelings and reality: to grasp that an impression is not a prognosis, and a fear is not a fact.</p>
<p>One side of the mind has to treat the other with a robust, kindly scepticism: ‘I know you’re sure there is a bear out there (at that party, in that newspaper article, in that office meeting). But is there one really? Really really?’ Emotion will be screaming ‘yes!’ as if one’s life depends on it. But we’ve been here before and we need, with infinite forbearance, to let the screaming go on a little – and ignore it entirely. The cure lies in watching the panic unfold and in refusing to get involved in its seeming certainties.</p>
<p>We need to be like a pilot of a sophisticated aircraft coming into land in deep fog on autopilot – their senses may tell them that a dreadful collision is imminent, but their reason knows that the sums have been done correctly and that a smooth landing is, despite the darkness and the awful vibrations, about to unfold.</p>
<p>To get better, which really means to stop dreading bears everywhere, we need to spend more time thinking about the specific bear that we once saw. The impulse is to focus always on the fear of the future. But we need instead to direct our minds back to the past – and revisit certain damaging scenes with compassion and in kindly company. A consequence of not knowing the details of what once scared us is a fear of everything into the endless future. What sort of bear was it; what did it do to us; how did we feel? We need to relocalise and repatriate the bear, to get to know it as a spectre that happened at one point in one place, so that it can stop haunting us everywhere for all time.</p>
<p>That we were once very scared is our historical tragedy; the challenge henceforth is to stop giving ourselves ever-new reasons to damage the rest of our lives with fear.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is that the very scared are traumatised. Psychological trauma can be defined as a negative event so overwhelming that one cannot properly understand, process or move on from it – but, and this is the devilish aspect to it, nor can we easily remember it or reflect upon its nature and its effects on us. It is lodged within but remains hidden from us, making its presence known only via symptoms and pains, altering our sense of reality without alerting us to its subterranean operations.</p>
<p>Predictably, a lot of psychological trauma happens in childhood. Children are especially vulnerable to being traumatised, because they are congenitally unable to understand themselves or the world very well – and have to rely to an uncommon degree on parents who are frequently less than mature, patient or balanced. A child may, for example, be traumatised by a parent who – through no particular fault of their own – becomes heavily depressed shortly after childbirth. Or a child may be traumatised through exposure to a parent’s titanic rage or violence. Or, because the widest category of psychological trauma is also the most innocuous, a child may be traumatised by what psychologists term ‘neglect’, which might mean that, at a critical age (between birth and five years old, and especially in the first eighteen months), it was not properly cherished, soothed, comforted and, to use a large but valuable word, loved.</p>
<p>The leading symptom of trauma is fear. Traumatised people are, above anything else, scared. They are scared of getting close to others, of being abandoned, of being humiliated and disgraced, of falling ill, probably of sex, of travelling, of their bodies, of parties, of key bits of their mind and – in the broad sense – of the world. The legacy of having been traumatised is dread, an unnameable, forgotten, unconscious memory of terror and fear projected outwards into a future. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott observed: ‘The catastrophe one fears will happen has already happened.’ That is why, in order to find out the gist of what might have occurred to us long ago, we should ask ourselves not so much about the past (we won’t directly be able to remember), but about what we are afraid will happen to us going forward. Our apprehension holds the best clues as to our history.</p>
<p>Crucially, and surprisingly, it can take a very long time before traumatised people even realise they are such a thing. A leading consequence of trauma is to have no active memory of what was traumatic – and therefore no sense of how distorted one’s picture of reality actually now is. Traumatised people don’t go around thinking that they are unnaturally scared; they just think that everything is terrifying. They don’t notice their appallingly low sense of self-worth; they just assume that others are likely to mock and dislike them. They don’t realise how uncomfortable intimacy is; they merely report not being happy in this or that relationship. In other words, trauma colours our view of reality but, at the same time, prevents us from noticing the extent to which we are peering at life through a distorted lens.</p>
<p>Only with a lot of time, luck, self-reflection and perhaps the odd breakdown do traumatised people come to a position where they start to notice that the way they think of the world isn’t necessarily the way it actually is. It is a vast step towards mental well-being to be able to be usefully suspicious of one’s first impulses and to begin to observe how much fear and self-hatred one is bringing to situations that truly don’t warrant them.</p>
<p>Processing trauma usually works best when we can hook up our own malfunctioning and distorted brain to another more clear-sighted one – and can test our readings of reality against those of a wise friend or therapist. We stand to recognise that – to our great surprise – we are not perhaps inherently disgusting; maybe not everyone hates us; perhaps everything isn’t headed for disaster; maybe we are not in line for a horrific punishment. And, crucially, if we do suffer reversals, maybe we could find our way out of them, because we are (and this can come as a true revelation) now adults, not a nine-month-old infant who underwent something awful.</p>
<p>Overcoming trauma is the work of years – but the beginning of the end starts with a very small step: coming to realise that we might actually be traumatised and that the world may not be the dark, overwhelming and dread-filled place we had always assumed it had to be.</p>
