        <h1>Learning</h1>
<p>By improving our self-awareness and prioritizing beneficial relationships, we give ourselves a good chance of holding on to our sanity. Our brains never stop developing and we do have some choices about how they develop. The third cornerstone of sanity is concerned with how we keep our brains – and therefore ourselves – fit.</p>
<p>High levels of stress result in panic or in the brain dissociating. Dissociation is a disconnection amongst our thoughts, sensations, feelings and actions – experienced as a type of blanking out. Therefore high levels of stress are to be avoided. However, no stress at all means that the brain does not get any exercise. A brain is not unlike a muscle, in that the cliché ‘use it or lose it’ applies. Moderate levels of stress keep our minds in condition, and help us to stay sane. This ‘good stress’ promotes the neural growth hormones that support learning. Good stress, unlike the type that causes dissociation, can be experienced as pleasurable; it can motivate us or make us curious. More importantly, it triggers neural plasticity, which is why I get excited about it.</p>
<p>In psychotherapy, quite often, what the client and I are working towards is a position where the client is able to tolerate their feelings. We call this ‘affect regulation’, a process of inhibiting anxiety and fear to allow processing to continue in the face of strong emotion. To work at this level we cannot be too comfortable, because then new learning does not take place; but nor can we be too uncomfortable, for then we would be in the zone where dissociation or panic takes over. Good work takes place on the boundary of comfort. Some psychotherapists refer to this place as ‘the growing edge’ or ‘a good-stress zone’, or talk of ‘expanding the comfort zone’. The good-stress zone is where our brains are able to adapt, reconfigure and grow. Think of the brain as a muscle and think of opportunities to flex it. The more we flex it, the better our brain functions.</p>
<p>The richer and more stimulating our environment, the more encouraged we feel to learn new skills and expand our knowledge. Such learning seems to have the side-benefit of boosting our immune system. There are some animal studies that show that an intellectually stimulating environment can compensate for the damaging effects of lead-poisoning. Two groups of rats were given water contaminated with lead. One group was put in a stimulating environment and the other was not. Professor Jay Schneider, who conducted the experiment, said that the magnitude of the protective effect of an educationally stimulating environment on the rats’ ability to withstand the poison surprised him. I am sad to report the rats in the less stimulating environment did not fare so well. I am the same. When I go away on holiday to a new place I feel refreshed by having been stimulated by new sights, smells, environments and culture. This is an example of good stress. I like to imagine I can feel it doing me good, and the rat experiment suggests that it really might be.</p>
