        <h1>3. There Are Only Two People Outside</h1>
<p>‘“Miracles have ceased.” Have they indeed? When? They had not ceased this afternoon when I walked into the wood and got into bright, miraculous
      sunshine, in shelter from the roaring wind.’</p>
<p>(RALPH WALDO EMERSON)</p>
<p>Anyone who follows the steps set out in this book will begin to reconnect with nature. This will lead to experiences that surprise and delight in small and then bigger ways.
  These experiences feed a desire to invest more in the process. New skills are learned, new knowledge gained, senses are heightened, awareness grows, new connections are discovered and experiences
  become more profound. The cycle strengthens further.</p>
<p>Enriching our experience of the outdoors will make us appreciate how unaware most of us are, most of the time. This is both worrying and exciting, and leads to a parting between the connected
  person and the disconnected. To the aware, there is no point in occupying a middle ground, as it merely offers a weaker, less satisfying version of what is available. The gulf grows as the aware
  person takes more delight in the process, and their sense of connection flourishes.</p>
<p>It does not take long before it is possible to look back at your former self – the person who did not connect with nature – and find a strange creature you barely recognize. Instead
  of pitying this poor mole, one that has never taken the time to sniff above the ground, you will want to encourage others to explore, to poke their snouts into the air and not to fear the million
  scents they find there.</p>
<p>A Final Exercise</p>
<p>Once you have read this book and tried the exercises, return to a spot you knew before reading the book. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What time is it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What direction am I looking?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Use nature to answer these questions. Then ask yourself two more:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is this place the same place I stood in before?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the same person who was here earlier?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are no right answers to questions three and four, and it is the process of trying to reach an answer of any kind that is of value. Even if there were correct answers,
      they would have changed by the time you arrived at them.</p>
<p>A Final Thought</p>
<p>It should be expected that we will find wonder in a vast mountain landscape, but it is a more serious challenge to find wonder in a hill. It is a great achievement to find it
  in a molehill.</p>
