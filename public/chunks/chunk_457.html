        <h2>The Benefits of a Breakdown</h2>
<p>So dreadful can the idea of failing be in our eyes that we may spend much of our lives – and expend titanic energies – trying to avoid it. We work with ferocity, scheme relentlessly, ingratiate ourselves with people we loathe and fill every minute of the day with schemes to raise our income and highlight our name. We scan the horizon fearfully for enemies and risks. We are, in the end, engaged in an exhausting race, in which we only ever feel a few moments away from what scares us above all: the beast of failure.</p>
<p>For a long time, we may manage to stay just ahead of the spectre, until one day, wholly of our own accord, we come to an abrupt and surprising stop. We can’t get out of bed; we can hardly speak; we can’t be bothered to move or fight any more. We don’t care what people are saying or what they will think. Despite everything we’re meant to do and all the places we’re expected to be, our deep selves are refusing to cooperate with our societal obligations. After a lifetime, something inside us can’t take it any more. We’re having a breakdown.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s the very worst thing that could happen. We’re about to lose all our hard-won advantages. Our boss is shocked. Friends and family may try to remain sympathetic, but the disappointment on their faces is evident; this is extremely inconvenient for everyone who depends on us. Surely we were meant to be above this sort of thing? There are panicked attempts to contact doctors and psychiatrists and hopes that some pills might quickly bring this unfortunate episode to a close. Everyone longs for normality and a return to the treadmill of success. We are a truly terrifying sight, in our pyjamas at midday, wandering around the kitchen, talking about how meaningless most of what we have ever done has really been, gazing into the middle distance at a vase of lilac flowers and mumbling how we might want to change things, and be someone else.</p>
<p>Breakdowns are undoubtedly frightening and a bore for those around us, but – within bounds – they can also be extremely useful. They can be occasions in which long pent-up or denied truths (about what we are angry about or deeply long for, what we want to do or who we hope to be with) punch through the veil of ordinary life and insist on being heard. A repressed authenticity fights the forces of inertia and the emotional status quo. We dare, in a way we perhaps have never done, to declare our true wishes. A breakdown may be a prelude to a breakthrough.</p>
<p>From our earliest years, we might have felt that if we were to gain the support of people around us, we would have to succeed on their terms rather than our own. We sensed a choice between being loved and being real and – understandably enough – chose the former. We ticked boxes of their making. We jumped through their hoops. We became practiced at precisely meeting their expectations. We put our sincere selves away and bowed to their service. We developed world-beating expertise at people-pleasing.</p>
<p>In our careers, we likely chose a safe but honourable profession where we could be sure of applause. We led blameless, honourable lives; we toed the line, we laughed when we needed to. We did what was expected.</p>
<p>But the charade could only be expected to go on for so long. At some point, a deeper and more sincere part of us realises that we are going to die soon and declares that enough is enough. If this is the price of success, we want to fail. We may be scared of poverty and disapproval, but we are now even more scared of fakery. We cannot spend the whole of our lives in hock to the demands of people we secretly despise. We want to have lived at least a little before we have to die. And so we set about smashing the edifice of prestige and respectability that we have built up. We quit our job, we tell a few false friends to go away, we sit on our own for hours looking at the sky – and we weep at how insincere and lost we have been. We tell another few friends that we have at last found our path – and they ask us how long it might be until the medication starts to work. We have wilfully brought about failure in some areas of our lives in order to allow for a deeper, slower, quieter sort of success in another.</p>
<p>From the prevalence of breakdowns, we can conclude that we don’t simply fear failure; we also – in a strange way – long for it, because in certain incarnations, it can provide us with the energy to clear out the false gods we have been worshipping for too long. At this time, we make a resolution to stop pleasing everyone else in order to have a last, very overdue attempt at paying attention to the true self we have neglected for so long.</p>
