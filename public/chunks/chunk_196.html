        <h1>Homework</h1>
<p>This book is a fusion of my experiences with nature, formed since childhood, and a fifteen-year fascination with natural navigation, as well as the work of those whose writing
  has inspired me. I hope you will find much to inspire you in this book, and in the following ones too.</p>
<p>My second book, The Natural Explorer (Sceptre, 2012), expands on many of the themes in this book and also introduces a few new ones.</p>
<p>The following books have been valuable sources. They are all recommended further reading.</p>
