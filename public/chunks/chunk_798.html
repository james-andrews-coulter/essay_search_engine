        <h3>5. When we realise we’re not compatible</h3>
<p>The Romantic view of love stresses that the ‘right’ person means someone who shares our tastes, interests and general attitudes to life. This might be true in the short term. But, over an extended period of time, the relevance of this fades dramatically, because differences inevitably emerge. The person who is truly best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste, but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently and wisely; the person who is good at disagreement.</p>
<p>Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate difference that is the true marker of the ‘right’ person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it must not be its precondition.</p>
<p>Romanticism has been unhelpful to us. We have learned to judge ourselves by the hopes and expectations fostered by a misleading philosophy. By its standards, our own relationships are almost all damaged and unsatisfactory. No wonder separation or divorce so often appears to be inevitable. They shouldn’t. We merely need to change our ideologies: to tell ourselves more accurate stories about the progress of relationships; we need to have to hand ideas, narratives, concepts and jokes that normalise our troubles and show us an intelligent and helpful path through them.</p>
