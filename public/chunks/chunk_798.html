        <h2>WHAT IS NOT BEING SAID</h2>
<p>Therapists famously listen to their clients carefully, but as much as they are listening to what’s being said, they are equally attuned to what is not being said, to emotions that should be expressed given what is being recounted—for instance, a terrible story about loss or neglect—and yet have somehow drifted out of the story, relegated to the unconscious under the weight of untenable psychic pain. Someone might tell a therapist about their father’s sudden arrest and six-month stay in prison, then end with a small laugh and the remark, “It was all quite funny really.” But the therapist won’t be laughing back.</p>
<p>Their aim will be to reunite their client with their exiled feelings. So they might pause, at the end of an ostensibly cheery tale about something dreadful, and say, “That must have been very frightening . . .” or “It seems so unfair really”—and hope thereby to help the client recover contact with their authenticity and truth.</p>
<p>Likewise, a skilled lover will know that pride and misplaced bravery might frequently lead their partner into diversionary behaviors and stories that mask their actual feelings. After returning from a lunch with their mother, they might turn the bitter relationship they have with her into a succession of humorous anecdotes involving the old lady and the waiter. But a tender lover schooled by therapy might add a small rejoinder: “It sounds like she still manages to hurt you every time you see her. It can’t be easy.” We would then, as the partner, perceive that we had landed on that most special of beings: someone—like the best sort of therapist and the most enticing of lovers—who knows us better than we know ourselves.</p>
