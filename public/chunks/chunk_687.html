        <h3>¶ Success at School vs. Success in Life</h3>
<p>Given how long we spend in schools of various kinds, and the intense efforts we often make to obtain good grades in them, it is bewildering and deeply counter-intuitive how often success at school does not automatically translate into success in life: the star student may move into a good-sounding job, but then not flourish; the person who couldn’t pass their exams may end up running the business (or, as importantly, may form a long-term, contented relationship).</p>
<p>If we examine the current dominant idea of education, the disconnect is not surprising. Success at school hinges on attitudes and mental habits that have little to offer when we face the challenges on which success in life depends.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is that school curricula are not reverse-engineered from fulfilled adult lives in the here and now. They don’t start by asking what skills and knowledge actually serve us in adulthood and devote themselves to nurturing star pupils in those areas. Instead, schools are typically fixated on several unhelpful ideas: that primarily you have to learn what is known already, rather than develop the capacity to solve problems to which no handy solution yet exists; that it is the intellect that needs to be trained, whereas it is the quality of our emotional intelligence that will make the biggest difference in our professional and personal relationships; that the teacher knows and you don’t, whereas in the rest of life, people in positions of authority may well be deeply mistaken in their views; that longer is better, though brevity, wit and memorable one-liners carry more weight everywhere else.</p>
<p>Schools teach us to redeploy rather than originate ideas; to seek permission; to meet rather than change expectations; to imagine that those in charge know what they are doing rather than guessing one can do better. Schools teach us anything other than the two skills that really determine the quality of adult life: knowing how to choose the right job, and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships.</p>
<p>That said, it isn’t the case that all we need to do to succeed at life is to flunk school. A good life requires us to do two very tricky things: be an extremely good boy or girl for twenty years, and simultaneously never really to believe in the long-term validity or seriousness of what we’re being asked to study. We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and committedly rebellious.</p>
