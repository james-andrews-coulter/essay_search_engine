        <h2>The Temptation to Repeat</h2>
<p>One of the most basic rallying cries of lovers at the dawn of the modern age was that people should be allowed to love ‘whomever they wanted’. Rather than love being dictated by concerns about prestige, money and lineage, our choice of partner was to be left wholly up to us. Our affections were to flow in whatever direction we pleased. Freedom was to replace tyranny.</p>
<p>This has long sounded like an eminently reasonable idea from which we can expect uncomplicated happiness to follow. But it misses a central quirk in our emotional make-up: that though we may now be technically free to marry anyone, we are – from a psychological perspective – still heavily constrained in whom we can find attractive. Our vows may be free; our desires are not. It may not be our families or our societies that oblige us to make certain choices, but we nevertheless remain as heavily constrained as our forebears.</p>
<p>This is because our desires push us towards candidates who – far more than we realise – are connected up with the figures we once loved in childhood. A bedrock idea of modern psychology is that the way we love as adults is conclusively determined by our patterns of love in our early histories. We love in the way that we once loved; we are attracted to those who echo the characteristics of our primary caregivers. Without knowing this is happening, when we find love, we are also always at some level refinding love – which may explain lovers’ frequent touching sense that their partner is someone they’ve known all their lives. In the psychological sense, they have.</p>
<p>This pattern of repetition need not necessarily be a problem, except for one detail: it involves privileging familiarity over happiness. Depending on what occurred in childhood, we may be driven to re-enact cycles of discomfort, loneliness or humiliation, because – for reasons we don’t understand – this feels like ‘home’. We may pick precisely those candidates best suited to paining us in ways that we were once pained. At the same time, we may be unable to muster any authentic attraction for candidates who we know, at an intellectual level, would be far better for us. We may come away from an encounter with someone kind, sane, patient and self-aware and declare, to our own puzzlement, that we simply couldn’t find them ‘attractive’ – by which we may in essence mean that something deep inside us recognised that they would be incapable of making us suffer in the way we need to suffer in order to feel we are loved. They seemed dangerously at risk of being able to fulfil our needs – and so had to be ruthlessly expunged as a threat to our integrity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious question we need to ask ourselves, once the compulsion to repeat a pattern is on the table, is what our original templates might have been like. We should ask ourselves:</p>
<p>•   What was the quality of your relationship with the parent or caregiver of the gender you are attracted to?</p>
<p>•   Did you feel they liked you? Did you like them?</p>
<p>•   Name three positive adjectives that you associate with your caregivers.</p>
<p>•   Name three negative adjectives that you associate with your caregivers.</p>
<p>If our answers lay any blame at the feet of our caregivers, we should be on alert. The difficulty is that our repetitions are unlikely to be crudely obvious. We may not get together with someone ‘like’ our parent, but we may still be at great risk of falling for someone who makes us feel like our parent once made us feel. For example, a parent might have been a working-class mechanic who left school at 15, and we might have spent our entire young adult lives running away from the bullying and unhappiness we came to associate with them by hanging out in more aesthetic and educated circles. There we might have found a new partner with a PhD in music and a sophisticated manner – someone who we were certain could ensure a very different and far better life for us. But we are not – on this basis alone – necessarily in the clear in the long term, for what might unite both candidates at a subterranean level is the emotions they generate in us. Here, both the factory worker and the oboe player might be identical: both might activate a feeling that we are unimportant to them; both might leave us with the impression that they have other things on their mind. One person might listen to the songs of Schubert and wear velvet slippers around the house; the other might spend the weekends shouting on the football terraces and dress in jeans – but both might, in terms of their impact, be identical. We might have made extraordinary efforts to escape a parent, only to discover that we have, to our horror, unwittingly refound them in disguise.</p>
<p>Some further questions:</p>
<p>•   Might you be proposing to marry your mother or father? Cease to think about surface similarities (clothes, accents, jobs, appearance) and concentrate on one thing only: how they make you feel.</p>
<p>•   How did the parent of the gender you are attracted to make you feel about yourself?</p>
<p>•   How does your partner make you feel about yourself?</p>
<p>To recognise, or admit more clearly than before, that one has been – perhaps for a long time – trapped within a pattern of repetition can initially be highly dismaying. But a diagnosis does not have to determine our future. The crucial step in dismantling the repetition is to notice it. The more we understand why our desire has traditionally been directed towards certain sorts of candidates, the more we are free to push ourselves to deviate from the score, till the moment, one day many years from now, when we might dare to love someone who resembles no one we have ever yet known intimately – that is, someone deeply kind.</p>
<p>But if our partners continue to resemble a difficult parent, managing the issue well still allows us a chance to resolve one of our most fervent wishes from early childhood: that we might have saved a tricky parent from their own worst sides. We could, with a partner modelled on our archetype, have an opportunity to play things out in a way that we were never able to in our early years. Our parent might have been impatient and loud, and we would have loved to slow them down and discover their potential for tenderness, but we had none of the tools to do so. We could barely speak and mostly cowered in terror. Yet around their successor in adult life, we have another chance to resolve things to our satisfaction. Now, with all the benefits of maturity, we can eloquently talk to the partner about their haste and their irritability; we can spend a whole dinner analysing with them why they started to shout, and explore the link between their ill temper and their own histories. Handled with resolve and perspicacity, their defensiveness may crumble, and they might turn out to be both open and grateful. We could frame things calmly and encourage them to look into themselves in a way that would make a decisive difference. We might even manage to persuade them to go to therapy. We’ll thereby be pulling off one of the great feats of mature love: arranging for a different kind of ending.</p>
