        <h2>VI: THE ESCALATION ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>There are moments in a couple’s life when what began as a simple conversation abruptly turns into a hugely vindictive row, because one party makes a move that – as their partner soon points out – is entirely out of proportion with the issue at hand.</p>
<p>A couple might be talking in a low-level way about some apparently insignificant matter: how they will get to the party that evening, whether it’s time to invite their mother around again, if the correct pronunciation is o-re-gano or ore-ga-no. And then, with bewildering rapidity, a partner will level an accusation that seems wildly out of sync with the preceding dialogue. They may respond with untrammelled passion, ‘Well, maybe I don’t even want to go to the party. Why do our most precious moments always need the presence of a hundred witnesses? Why, in Italy last year, did you need to invite Mo, Dan, Ben and his sister too? What next, a camera so a thousand people can watch us making love – if we even did such a thing anymore?’</p>
<p>Or they might reply, with equal fury, ‘You’re always like this, aren’t you? It’s like last year at your dad’s – every time I made a suggestion, you were onto me, showing me that I was wrong and implying that it’s so hard for you to have to be with me. Why can’t you just take my side on something for once?!’</p>
<p>At this point, the partner on the receiving end of these lines is liable to respond that there has been a gross violation of procedure, and that on this basis something very illegitimate has happened, which they have every right to be upset about and, henceforth, to focus the argument on. After all, the conversation was meant to be about whether to order a taxi for the party, not about what happened in Italy last year. Or it was meant to be about the best way to pronounce the Italian name of a particular herb, not the balance of power within the couple. It is deeply offensive that the topic should have swerved so violently and with so little warning. A new argument soon bubbles up about what it is right or fitting to argue about and how much warning should be given before a new and large point of contention is introduced.</p>
<p>We might term such disputes ‘escalation arguments’, where a discussion about topic X swiftly unleashes an only tenuously related but much larger accusation around Y, which the recipient dismisses as having been incorrectly introduced.</p>
<p>This kind of argument is symptomatic of a relationship in which emotional hygiene has not been followed: Areas of tension have not been correctly discussed, cleansed and ‘flushed out’, and so disappointments and ill feelings have been left to develop an energy, which has been waiting for too long to emerge. The person making the accelerated vindictive remark looks like they are being disproportionate and seems at fault for suddenly turning up the heat, but a dangerous wall of steam has been building up for which both parties are arguably responsible.</p>
<p>The person on the receiving end of the abrupt tirade is in a sense correct: They are right that it is extremely inconvenient and jarring to be confronted without decorum. They are also right that the point has come out too fast. But, more accurately regarded, the accuser is moving swiftly and directly to the core of an issue that should have been covered long ago. The escalated argument is signalling some unfinished business, which is interrupting the free and natural exchange of intimacy.</p>
<p>We should, when we can manage it, not hold it against our partner if they haven’t followed correct conversational procedure. It should, in a sense, never be a bad time to bring up a big theme. More broadly, two lovers should regularly allow themselves to have a sequence of small arguments in order not to have to be surprised or swept away by enormous irregular ones.</p>
