        <h2>XI: THE PARENTAL RESEMBLANCE ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>There is a move many of us make in the heat of an argument with our partner that is at once devastating, accurate and entirely uncalled for. In a particularly contemptuous, sly and yet gleeful tone, partners are inclined to announce, as if a rare truth was being unearthed, ‘You’re turning into your mother/ father.’</p>
<p>The claim is apt to silence us because, however much we may have tried to develop our own independent characters, we can’t help but harbour a deep and secret fear that we are prey to an unconscious psychological destiny. In one side of our brain, we are aware of a range of negative qualities that we observed in our parents which we sense are intermittently hinted at in our own personalities. And we are terrified.</p>
<p>We catch ourselves rehearsing opinions that once struck us as patently absurd or laughable. In moments of weakness, we find ourselves replaying just the same sarcastic or petty, vain or angry attitudes we once felt sure we would never want to emulate. The accusations of our partner hurt so much because they knock up against a genuine risk.</p>
<p>At the same time, the criticism is deeply underhand. Firstly, because even if we ourselves occasionally share an account of our parents’ failings with our partners, the universal rules of filial loyalty mean that we – and only we – are ever allowed to bring these up again in an aggressive tone.</p>
<p>Secondly, the accusation is unfair because it is attempting to push us into denying something that is invariably partly correct. How could we not be a little like our parents, given the many years we spent around them, the untold genes we share with them and the malleability of the infant mind?</p>
<p>We should never get railroaded into protesting that we are unlike those who put us on the Earth; we should undercut the implicit charge by immediately, candidly admitting that we are, of course, very much like our parents, as they are akin to theirs. How could we be anything else! Why wouldn’t we be! But in a twist to the normal argument, we should then remind our partners that we chose to be with them precisely in order to attenuate the risks of an unexamined parental destiny.</p>
<p>It was and remains their solemn duty not to mock us for being like our parents, but to assist us with kindness to become a little less like them where it counts. By hectoring and accusing us, they aren’t identifying a rare truth from which we hide away in shame; they are stating the obvious and then betraying the fundamental contract of adult love. Their task as our partner isn’t to bully us into making confessions that we would have been ready to accept from the start; it’s to help us to evolve away from the worst sides of people who have inevitably messed us up a little and yet whom we can’t (of course, despite everything) stop loving inordinately.</p>
