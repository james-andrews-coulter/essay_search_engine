        <h2>4. Look at Nature</h2>
<p>There are so many books about nature – and about specific species – that it is hard to make recommendations. When I really need to remind myself that there is no
  limit to the bizarre activities that are ‘natural’, I refer to The Encyclopedia of Land Invertebrate Behaviour by Rod and Ken Preston-Mafham (Blandford, 1993), which has
  beautiful photographs and describes an infinite variety of ‘natural’ adaptations which allow me to stop worrying about the odd social actions of my acquaintances.</p>
<p>More seriously, Annie Dillard’s beautiful book Pilgrim at Tinker Creek (Canterbury Press, 2011 – new edition), which won a Pulitzer prize in 1975, addresses these issues and
  at the same time describes a solitary sojourn in a valley in Virginia, USA.</p>
