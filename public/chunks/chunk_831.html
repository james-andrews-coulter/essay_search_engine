        <h2>WHY DID THEY LEAVE US?</h2>
<p>They’ve gone – and what we need most of all is to understand why?</p>
<p>What is striking is that, despite what friends and well-meaning acquaintances tell us, we already know. It is us.</p>
<p>We firmly and naturally assume that the explanation has to do with our miserable failings, our dispiriting character and our wearisome appearance. They’ve gone because we weren’t good enough. They got to know us intimately, far better than almost anyone else has ever done, and then, inevitably, they saw the truth behind our characters and were horrified. It is not the relationship that failed: We failed.</p>
<p>But, counter-intuitively, what seems most obvious to us in our hearts might not actually be true. There is a famous experiment in the history of psychology which pinpoints our tendency to project: that is, to read decisive, clear explanations drawn from our minds into what are in fact ambiguous situations in the world beyond us.</p>
<p>The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), as it is technically known, was developed in the 1930s by the American psychologist Henry Murray. It presents us with a series of images and asks us to say what is going on. People tend to have quite specific ideas of what is happening in each scenario. For example, based on the picture above, a number of conclusions could be drawn:</p>
<p>The Thematic Apperception Test consisted of images, similar to this one, showing provocative, ambiguous scenes.</p>
<p>•    She is fed up with him; he is weak and a bit boring.</p>
<p>•    She has just told him that their relationship isn’t working and that she is leaving.</p>
<p>•    He has just told her they have to break up and the reason has something to do with their sex life. He is not as fulfilled as he wants to be.</p>
<p>•    It seems to be about his parents. She wants him to distance himself from them. If he doesn’t, she can’t be expected to stay around forever.</p>
<p>The power of the experiment derives from the fact that the image has, by design, no definite significance: They’re just actors carefully asked to assume certain ambiguous poses. The stories and the meanings come from us.</p>
<p>This is often exactly what happens around our own heartbreaks. We may never actually know precisely why the other person left us. However well we know someone, they are never fully transparent to us. What they say may be only a part of what is really on their mind. Their deeper motives remain obscure – perhaps even to them. We’re presented with a fact – they have left us – and onto that we project a meaning. But the meaning we give to the fact comes, in large part, from us.</p>
<p>Admitting to ourselves that we won’t always understand another person’s inner workings is an underused and powerful skill. At one of the foundational moments of philosophy in ancient Athens, Socrates argued that a huge component of wisdom lies in our capacity to accept our ignorance in certain situations: ‘The wise know when they don’t know.’ This recognition of not-knowing, and the reminder of our tendency to project, may be helpful in easing us away from the more catastrophic and self-incriminating interpretations of a break-up.</p>
<p>The lover who furiously told us they never wanted to see us again may, in the hidden recesses of their soul, have actually been thinking: ‘I’m so sad this didn’t work out; I wish I could find a way to make this work; you are so lovely in many ways, but there’s something desperate in me that’s turning away from your offer of love.’ The person who coldly texts us, ‘That’s it, I’m out’ may, behind the scenes, be weeping at their own sense of loss and failure rather than (as we imagine) gleefully celebrating the end of their over-extended encounter with us. The person who says, ‘I wish this could work, but I’ve got to concentrate on my career’ might actually be sincere rather than (as we might darkly suppose) putting a polite cover over their contempt for us.</p>
<p>The acceptance of ambiguity is liberating: We’re free to recognise that the ending wasn’t necessarily all our fault; that there may have been forces at work other than our own inadequacy. We’re still very sad, but the target of our misery is a little more bearable: We can focus on the deep, sorrowful strangeness of love and loss rather than suffering an extended, excoriating confrontation with our own inadequacies.</p>
