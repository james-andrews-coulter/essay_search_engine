            <h2>23.Travelling for Perspective</h2>
<p>There’s a long tradition of going travelling in search of things we lack. In the eighteenth century, well-off young English men would take trips to Paris and Rome to acquire more elegant manners and study Classical history; today we might travel to find sunshine or nature.</p>
<p>But there are many things we struggle with beyond our inability to understand Roman culture or endure a long, wet winter – and travel can help us with them. A central issue is that we are constantly at risk of feeling disenchanted with our circumstances. At a personal level, we are continually exposed to the enviable lives of others; our imaginations are haunted by our comparative lack of success. At a more general level, our societies often appear fundamentally unimpressive: our institutions look compromised, our media seems coarse and sensationalist, our cities feel chaotic. There is, apparently, little to be grateful for.</p>
<p>In theory – of course – we know that can’t be entirely true. We know, in the abstract, that we’re lucky to have enough to eat and a roof over our heads. But such reminders feel emotionally unreal and usually have little impact on their own.</p>
<p>For the truth to hit home, we may have to immerse ourselves in true poverty and a genuinely dysfunctional society. We may need to travel to the large parts of the world where people live, on average, on $500 a year or less.</p>
<p>We may need to visit a place where it’s normal for the police to extort money from you; where a newspaper editor is likely to be arrested for criticising authority; where government is self-evidently tied to violence and corruption; where the opposition is an armed faction; where a fair trial is a rarity; where luxury would be clean sheets or a tube of toothpaste; where there might be excrement in your food or a dead rat under your bed. A city or country where people maddened by toothache pull out their own teeth; where horrendous infections are commonplace; where large numbers of children receive almost no formal education; where, if there is a school, it is quite probable that those in charge are syphoning off the funds; where sewers run openly through the streets; where people spend their days picking over the refuse in huge dumps.</p>
<p>We may well end up deeply moved. As importantly, we are invited to change our perceptions of our own lives, to renew our appreciation of so much that we’d taken for granted: a toilet that flushes, a washing machine, space to ourselves, a pleasant lunch. And we may derive a new sense of how profound and powerful the achievements of our own societies – for all their failings – really are.</p>
<p>Paradoxical though it sounds, travels to places where the true hardships of existence are grimly evident can provide a needed education in gratitude. Our encounter with the reality of the lives of so many others pushes us towards a more accurate perspective on our own condition. Like many great artworks in elegant galleries, they teach us to see – and admire – aspects of the world we usually inhabit that we had scarcely noticed before. And they do this with rather more conviction and lasting impact than any canvas on a wall.</p>
