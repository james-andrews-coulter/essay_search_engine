        <h4>I LOVE YOU BUT WE HAVE SO LITTLE IN COMMON</h4>
<p>Generally we select our companions and friends on the basis that we have a lot in common with them. We enjoy the same activities, we have broadly the same values, we share a sense of humour or we enjoy discussing the same topics.</p>
<p>But the central feature of families is that we don’t choose who we are related to. Looking round a family gathering we might be struck by the thought that there isn’t a single person here that we’d spend time with, if it didn’t happen to be for the accidents of genetics and matrimony.</p>
<p>There’s a younger cousin who is very shy and keen on tap-dancing and obsessed with a video game we’ve hardly heard of. There’s an aunt who is rather bossy and fussy and who tells long stories about bridge competitions. There’s a brother-in-law who is a very decent person, but whose outlook, temperament and interests are very different from our own. And our sister, perhaps, has political views our friends would find disturbing and often quotes approvingly a newspaper we’d only refer to for comic effect.</p>
<p>But these people are still important to us. We built sandcastles on the beach with our sister when we were four; there’s an intonation in her voice, when she says certain words, that’s precisely – and uniquely – the same as ours; the younger cousin’s nose is just like that of the grandmother we share; the bridge-playing aunt was very kind when we were small, and gave us a brown velvet monkey who lived under our pillow for years; the brother-in-law has been deeply helpful in sorting out our mother’s finances. For some of them, we will attend their funerals; some of them will be there at ours.</p>
<p>It’s not an exaggeration to say that we love these people. But often, when we’re together we resort to discussing innocuous things: it was unexpectedly nice weather yesterday, the roads weren’t too busy getting here.</p>
<p>A way we can express our love is through asking them about the things that interest them – even if the overt topic isn’t one that’s directly of interest to us.</p>
<p>→I forget what age you would have been when you started learning to tap-dance? Who did you learn with? Were they a good teacher? What was tricky to learn?</p>
<p>Has your attitude to bridge changed over the years? Who do you particularly enjoy playing with? What makes them a good partner or opponent?</p>
<p>What was my mother / father like when they were fourteen? What was happening in your life then?</p>
<p>What are you focusing on at work at the moment? Any annoying colleagues?</p>
<p>We’re not just firing off random questions. We’re getting them to talk about what they enjoy, what is important to them, or what has mattered in their lives – rather than about what specifically appeals to us. It’s a way of showing love because, even if only for a short while, we’re prioritising their happiness. And what may happen is that we discover the true commonalities of existence. Around the unalluring details of their lives all the deeper themes emerge: rivalries, disappointments, anxious hopes, fears, limitations, yearnings, small pleasures, unexpected happiness.</p>
<p>It is often only through our families that we have this strangely important opportunity: to be close to people whose characters don’t intuitively appeal to us, to get to know the reality of lives lived by values other than our own. And we may find that we in return are loved by these individuals who in any other setting we would, very understandably but with great injustice, dismiss merely as bores and eccentrics.</p>
