        <h2>Killala Bay Landing Stat</h2>
<p>Some of the reason why we are likely to have become sad and ill is that we have spent far too long at our screens. And the problem with these silicon-chip devices is that they are in the habit of making many things feel very easy, too easy, and of making other things feel hard, too hard.
The internet is founded on an aspiration to dissolve time and space. Everything should be immediate. No sooner have we formulated a question than we should have its answer; no sooner have we developed an appetite than we should satisfy it. Nothing should elude our will.
This is beguiling but also, over any length of time, poisonous, for most of what is valuable depends on a capacity to endure delay, frustration, ambiguity and boredom. If we rely on a tool that gives us everything we want, we will end up with nothing of what we need. While sparing us multiple efforts, our technology weakens our muscles for the labours that a good life demands. If we only have to click and drag, point and expand, if everything can be translated and solved by someone else, we will think it impossible that other bits of life should remain intimidatingly hard: that we may need to explain ourselves patiently to a partner; that we may have to seduce someone through empathetic understanding; that we might need to spend years patiently writing a book or labour at securing a degree or founding a business.
The internet’s speed and simplicity don’t prepare us for the ongoing trickiness of the rest of existence; they spoil us for the efforts we’ll continue to have to make. Like an early inheritance for an indulged child, they drain us of the will to fight.
This is why it can be necessary and liberating to realise that the internet’s apparent seamlessness is really an elaborate piece of trickery. It feels light, easy and free, but it is anything but. It was built by people in heavy boots with shovels and pickaxes; it was thought through by precise engineers. Every single full stop has had hours of coding behind it; nothing on a screen ever just landed there. The internet generates heat, it needs storage centres the size of airports, it pollutes rivers. We are messaging someone in Sao Paolo not by magic but because two vessels the Ile de Brehat and Ile de Sein — spent two years laboriously laying down the EllaLink undersea cable between Portugal and Brazil. Our posts about our toddler are sitting in the Facebook data centre in lowa, and our searches for a local Vietnamese restaurant are being routed through a Google facility in Oregon. The PDF we received from Sydney passed along the Southern Cross Cable Network, with shoals of fish swimming above it, via a plant in Hawaii. Our emojis aren’t running on the holy spirit; they are burning coal.
The need for another kind of tourism opens up, one focused on the landscape of the internet that no one wants us to know about, on the mysterious fibres that run beneath our oceans and the warehouses lined with banks of computers. On such journeys, we might end up in the picturesque village of Killala in Ireland, where in a nondescript building the size of a petrol station, nearly the entire internet traffic between Western Europe and the Eastern Seaboard of America is routed. This is where your searches for lesbian threesomes, the emails to your mother, the stalking of your ex-partner and the anguished enquiries about symptoms for bowel cancer have passed.
We will be prisoners until we realise the extent to which the masters of the internet are mesmerising us. It’s time to stop using our computers as divine toys; they are the work of some very clever and hard-headed people who are trying to anaesthetise us into passivity while themselves labouring extraordinarily hard in the background. We need to wake up and work out where the cables are buried.</p>
