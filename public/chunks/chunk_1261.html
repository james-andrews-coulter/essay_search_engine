        <h2>Roman Ruins</h2>
<p>By the time the arch was put up, celebrating Emperor Constantine’s military victory in 312 CE, the Roman Empire had already seen the first serious wobbles. There had been a string of disastrous rulers, the granaries were depleted, the legions were being challenged in North Africa and the Germanic tribes were restless on the Rhine. The greatest emperors were long gone. Rome had descended into oligarchical squabbling and decadence. The wealthy were paying slaves to attend the army in place of their sons. A strange new religion was taking hold that preached the virtues of forgiving foes rather than executing them summarily, or selling them into slavery. Nevertheless, there remained reasons to be hopeful. This was the greatest empire the world had ever known; the troops stood guard on the borders as far north as Scotland and as far east as Armenia. Viewed from the Palatine Hill at dusk, Rome was an impressive sight. The Colosseum still staged massive gladiatorial games (the famous naval Battle of Cape Ecnomus had recently been recreated there, the central arena flooded for the purpose); the heads of the empire’s enemies were still avidly paraded through the streets; there were still plenty of slaves available in the markets; the best chefs still turned out the most accomplished roasted peacocks and swans’ livers. It was to be a full ninety-eight more years until the Visigoths, commanded by the warlord Alaric, would finally smash their way into the city in 410 CE and introduce Rome to the new reality. The Romans gave us the term ‘memento mori’ (a warning supposedly whispered by slaves to their commanders to ward off the dangers of hubris), without suspecting that their entire civilisation would eventually become such a thing for the world. Yet nowadays, the active sense of tragedy around the old stones has dissipated. Tourists walk by with relative nonchalance. No one actively mourns the loss of the colonies in Algeria or the destruction of the elegant villas on the Bay of Naples. The assumption is that their time was simply up. By the arch there are ice cream sellers, ticket touts and even some well-mannered actors dressed up as Roman legionaries, offering selfies: the fall of Rome as an endearing comedy. We cannot seem to hold in mind how closely we are following in exactly their footsteps and how scary the path should feel. Our empire is as unstable, our values as unmoored. It won’t happen for a long while yet. There tends to be a lengthy gap between the early hairline cracks and the cataclysm. But the eventual collapse is certain; the only question surrounds the exact route to it.
Individual life is as imperilled, though a beautiful, egocentric blindness persuades us otherwise. We somehow continue to find the notion of our own deaths implausible even as others fall all around us. We take holiday snaps on the edge of our graves.
If we could witness the eventual fate of every one of our projects, we might laugh darkly. Would anyone who watched the departure of Julius Caesar’s army on its way to conquer the Gauls, or Marcus Aurelius addressing his immaculately disciplined soldiers on the Rhine, have had it in their hearts to inform these passionate figures of the eventual fate of their efforts?
It is no use merely going to Rome; we have to understand what Rome means for us and our plans, then set about reforming what remains of our lives in its liberating and usefully
terrifying shadow.</p>
