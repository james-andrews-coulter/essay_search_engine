        <h2>Strength vs. modesty</h2>
<p>Romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is for it to seem prominently ‘strong’.</p>
<p>Melancholic voters feel that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of, and will therefore avoid actions that could upset, alarm or confuse neighbours. They’re aware of how easily strength arouses the desire of others to be equally strong back. They suspect the best way to proceed might be to train in private for the worst – but extend a hand of friendship at every public turn.</p>

<p>Both Romantic and Melancholic political orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are, in any case, ever simply one or the other. But because a good political landscape requires a judicious balance of both, at this point in history, in many countries, it might be the Melancholic electoral attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently and which is most ripe for rediscovery.</p>
