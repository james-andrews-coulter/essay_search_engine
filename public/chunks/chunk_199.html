        <h2>2. The Senses</h2>
<p>Connecting Into Observation and Awareness, by Jon Boyd (Amethyst Moon, 2007), is a little-known book, but worth searching out for an eclectic mixture of orthodox and
  unusual ways of sensing the outdoors.</p>
<p>Coyote’s Guide to Connecting With Nature, by Jon Young, Ellen Haas and Evan McGown (OWLink Media, 2010), is a big book with an unusual approach. Like this book, it is written by
  those with experience of teaching outdoors, and this shines through. It contains many activities that will help further your connection.</p>
<p>David Chamovitz’s superb book, What a Plant Knows (Oneworld, 2012), is perfect for anyone who wishes to learn more about what plants can sense and how they react.</p>
