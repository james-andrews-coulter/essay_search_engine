        <h2>THE BENEFITS OF A BROKEN HEART</h2>
<p>It is not at all what we would have chosen for ourselves, or wished on anyone else, but there are – amidst the ruins – some benefits to be discovered (and quietly celebrated) around the business of having our hearts broken:</p>
<p>i. It hurt horribly, we were convinced we would die from the pain, and yet, remarkably, we have not. We are still around and will, next week, go to a party. We reach a rather extraordinary conclusion: We have managed to survive. And so, we can conclude: We are a great deal stronger than we originally anticipated.</p>
<p>ii. We have understood so much more about ourselves. The lessons were delivered in a grim way, of course, but through all the recriminations and accusations, the arguments and the tensions, we learnt things. We have come to recognise – in calmer moments – that we are really rather difficult to live with – a crucial realisation upon which our capacity to be a little easier to be with in the future can develop.</p>
<p>iii. As we recover, we realise that our inner contentment isn’t entirely dependent on any one person in particular. There are many people and things that can sustain and support us. The great love has gone, but many other loves are still open to us. We become more appreciative of what remains to us: There are many captivating books to read, new foods to try, the park is coated with enchanting flowers, we have friends who will put up with our calls late into the night. There is so much left to love.</p>
<p>iv. We learn to temper our expectations. All relationships are seriously imperfect in certain respects; we should endeavour to not ask quite so much of the next person we are with. We will know to be grateful for ‘good enough’.</p>
<p>v. We have gone through one of the universal sorrows of humanity. We rarely hear about the broken hearts of others, but we know that almost everyone has their own version of our sorrow (or will have one day). Our compassion for our fellow humans, and hence also for ourselves, becomes deeper and wider. We grow kinder and, in some moods, a little readier to laugh warmly at the absurdities and contradictions of the heart.</p>
