        <h3>4 Sprawl</h3>
<p>For most of history, humans lived in tightly organised, neatly aligned streets and squares — not because anyone thought this was especially attractive (though it is), but because it was convenient. When you had to get around on foot or at best on horseback, it paid to keep things close together. Furthermore, it was safer, because invaders might attack at any time, and it was crucial to ring your town with a wall, adding further impetus to keep everything well arranged inside, like a compact cutlery drawer or a toolkit.</p>
<p>But without anyone quite noticing, with the spread of cars in the 1920s, the pressure to use space neatly evaporated. One could now lounge on the earth, or sprawl lazily across it. Highways could meander between towers, bits of scrubland and scatterings of warehouses. The nervous and precise among us who like things to be neatly lined up, who are disturbed when a picture is slightly askew or the knife and fork are not equidistant from the plate, grew ever more sorrowful.</p>
