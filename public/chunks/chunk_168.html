            <h2>16.The Pleasure of the Romantic Minibreak</h2>
<p>One of the stranger aspects of relationships is that we may, in order to sustain them, need to go away together every now and then.</p>
<p>In theory, it should make no difference to love quite where we happen to be. But in practice, the furniture may have to alter, so that we can. The familiar backdrop of home keeps us too tightly and punitively tethered to whom we have so often been – which may mean, to the less impressive and more unkind versions of ourselves. The sofa remembers that argument we once had on it; the kitchen keeps us connected to some unpleasant scenes that unfolded in it over too many evenings.</p>
<p>But the new surroundings have no such memories. They allow us to start afresh and rediscover wellsprings of affection and generosity. The minibreak isn’t a chance to avoid conflict. It’s an opportunity to have some of the discussions we really need to have, with enough time and kindness to deal with what we uncover. The problem with our rows at home isn’t that they happen, but that we don’t find the energy to get to the root of them.</p>
<p>We’re carrying around a range of complaints. Perhaps they sounded too petty or humiliating to mention at the time. But when they fester, the currents of affection start to get blocked – and soon, we may find ourselves flinching when our partner tries to touch us. What we call ‘loss of desire’ is usually simply a kind of anger with a partner that hasn’t had a chance to understand itself.</p>
<p>The holiday is a safe moment in which to reveal some of these – typically entirely unintentional – hurts. It is a chance, too, for gratitude. The partner has brought us so much we’ve forgotten to thank them for. They have made it possible to do things we’d never have accomplished on our own; they’ve comforted us at certain moments, they’ve maybe understood and been kind to difficult aspects of who we are; possibly they have saved us from the worst effects of some specific tendencies in our nature.</p>
<p>With the help of a trip away, we can jog our memories and help each other to come to a fairer, more precise view of our lives together.</p>
