        <h2>Knowing Our Pasts</h2>
<p>Some of the most alarming people we ever risk meeting in the course of any search for love are those who insist that – despite the odds – they had a ‘happy childhood’, and even more provocatively, that their parents were ‘normal’.</p>
<p>Such declarations tend not to be symptoms of health so much as harbingers of shortfalls in self-awareness. The chances of anyone having come through the gauntlet of childhood and adolescence without injury are slight in the extreme; the likelihood of having been parented by exclusively mature individuals is even smaller. The goal is never to aim to be a psychologically uncomplicated person, but simply to know – in as much detail as possible – some of the ways in which we can never be so. The characters to fear aren’t ever those who have substantial problems – it is those who can’t grasp at any close level of detail what their problems might actually be.</p>
<p>This explains the centrality of the enquiry ‘How are you mad?’ within the early dating rituals. The question does not mean to persecute or accuse; it is intended to give space for two people to show, in unhurried, nonjudgemental ways, the soundness of their grasp on the wiring of their own psyches.</p>
