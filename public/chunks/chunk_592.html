        <h3>¶ Expectations</h3>
<p>High expectations are the secret cause of many of our agonies. We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are only humiliated if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it. Our expectations determine what we will interpret as a triumph and what must count as a failure. ‘With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,’ wrote the psychologist William James; ‘it is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities. Thus:</p>
<p>The problem with the modern world is that it does not stop lending us extremely high expectations. We are constantly invited to dream. Today, you may be short of cash, low on prestige and bruised by rejection. But, it is insinuated, these are transient troubles. Hard work, a positive attitude and bright ideas have every chance of breaking the deadlocks in due course. It is just a question of willpower. Modernity never ceases to emphasise that success could, somehow, be ours one day. In this way, it never ceases to torture us.</p>
