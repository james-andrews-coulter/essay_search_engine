        <h3>¶ Communism</h3>
<p>In describing his utopian Communist society, Karl Marx placed enormous emphasis on the idea of everyone having many different jobs. There were to be no specialists here. In a pointed dig at Adam Smith’s praise of specialisation, he wrote: ‘In communist society… nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes … thus it is possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, to fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner… without ever becoming a hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic.’ (The German Ideology, 1846.)</p>
<p>Marx’s solutions to capitalism’s problems were evidently awry, but he can be credited for eloquently articulating our longing to do so much more with our lives than a capitalist economy allows. In our hearts, we are far more multiple and promiscuous than it is currently possible to be: beneath the calm outward façade of the accountant might lie someone pining to try landscape gardening. Many a poet might want to work in industry for a few years. Specialisation might be an economic imperative, but it can be a human betrayal.</p>
