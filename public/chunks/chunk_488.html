        <h3>This too shall pass</h3>
<p>Not only do difficult moods insist that they are correct, they also seek to convince us that they are permanent. But our sense of self is naturally viscous; we are condemned to rise and fall, flow and ebb. Though we may be unable to shift a mood, we can at least realise that it is only ever such a thing, and that, in a few hours or days, it too shall pass.</p>
