        <h2>PARENTAL REPAIR</h2>
<p>Both we and our carer may be deep into adulthood, but if their tenderness heals us, it is likely to be because, in covert ways, what they are doing through their ministrations is repairing a deficit of early love. They will be reparenting our broken child selves.</p>
<p>One of the eternally paradoxical things about babies and small children is that they need love as much as they need milk and warmth in order to develop properly. They need to be cuddled, spoken and sung to, played with, held close and looked at with enthusiasm—and will as good as die inside without such care. Every child needs to experience what one could term “primary parental delight,” a basic feeling that they are limitlessly wanted by those who put them on the earth and are capable of generating intense pleasure through their very being. Without this, a child might survive, but they can never thrive. Their ability to walk the earth freely will always be somewhat in doubt. They will grow up with a sense of being superfluous, disruptive and, at heart, unappealing and shameful.</p>
<p>Such emotions feed directly into a broad range of mental illnesses: chronic anxiety, self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression. All of these have roots in a sense of not having mattered enough to anyone over long childhood years.</p>
<p>This defines the challenge for the carer in adulthood. Some of the work will involve making good failures of early provision. The wounded inner child will need to be convinced that what they didn’t receive decades ago could still be available today; that there might still be joy, reassurance, play, and kindness.</p>
<p>It might seem highly patronizing to tell an adult that they need to be reparented. In fact it’s the height of maturity to recognize that the small version of us must, if we’re ever to get better, allow ourselves another chance to experience what it could feel like to matter limitlessly to a kindly companion.</p>
