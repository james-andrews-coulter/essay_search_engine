        <h3>¶ Insomnia</h3>
<p>Insomnia is seldom a disease: it is an inarticulate, maddening but ultimately almost logical plea released by our core self, asking us to confront certain issues we’ve put off for too long. Insomnia isn’t really to do with not being able to sleep; it’s about not having given ourselves a chance to think.</p>
<p>It is the revenge of all the many thoughts we didn’t take seriously enough in the day.</p>
