            <h2>Losers as Winners</h2>
<p>Our society has an advanced tendency to label certain people as ‘winners’ and others – logically enough – ‘losers’. Aside from the evident meanness of this categorisation, the underlying problem with it is the suggestion that life might be a unitary, singular race, at the conclusion to which one could neatly rank all the competitors from highest to lowest.</p>
<p>The more confusing and complex truth is that life is really made up of a number of races that unfold simultaneously over very different terrain and with different sorts of cups and medals in view. There are races for money, fame and prestige, of course – and these attract many spectators and, in some social circles, the bulk of the coverage. But there are also races that measure other kinds of prowess worth venerating. There is a race for who can remain calmest in the face of frustration. There is a race for who can be kindest to children. There is a race measuring how gifted someone is at friendship. There are races focused on how attentive someone is to the evening sky or how good they are at deriving pleasure from autumn fruits.</p>
<p>Despite our enthusiasm for sorting competitors into neat ranks, a striking fact about the multi-race event of life is, quite simply, that no one is ever able to be the winner in every competition available. Furthermore, prowess in one kind of race can militate against one’s chances of success in others. Winning at being ruthlessly successful in business seems not – for example – generally to go hand in hand with ability in the race to appreciate the sky or find pleasure in figs. Equally, those who are terrific at gaining fame may be hampered when it comes to the race that measures ability to be patient around thoughtful but under-confident 3-year-olds.</p>
<p>We cannot, it seems, be winners at everything. Those who appear to be carrying off all the prizes and who are lauded as the superhuman athletes of life cannot, on closer examination, really be triumphing across the board. They are bound to be making a deep mess of some of the less familiar or prestigious races they are entered in for; in certain corners of the stadium, they’ll be falling over, tripping up, complaining loudly about track conditions and, perhaps, sourly denigrating the whole event as useless and not worth participating in.</p>
<p>If one cannot be a winner at everything, it follows that one cannot be a loser at everything either. When we have failed in certain races in the milliathlon of life, we retain ample opportunities to train and develop our strength to win in others. We may never again be able to compete in the race for fame, honour or money, but it’s still entirely open to us to compete in the race for kindness, friendship and forgiveness. We may even win in the not insignificant races for enjoying one’s own company or sleeping very soundly and without anxiety for many hours.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a winner or a loser, per se. There is only a person who has won in some areas and messed up in others. And, to go deeper, someone whose talent at winning in one sort of race means they must naturally and almost inevitably mess up in alternatives – and vice versa.</p>
<p>We never fail at life itself. When we mess up in worldly areas and feel dejected and isolated, the universe is just giving us an exceptional chance to begin the training that will one day mean we become star athletes in other less well-known but hugely important races – races about keeping a sense of humour, showing gratitude, forgiving, appreciating, letting go and making do. These are the noble tracks on which those who have ‘failed’ can finally, properly and redemptively learn to ‘win’.</p>
