        <h2>Oslo Radhus</h2>
<p>The spirit of the times invests considerable energy in persuading us that what we really want is to make a lot of money, to be famous, to stand out from the crowd and to become ‘someone’. But there are one or two rare places on earth that powerfully remind us that our true wishes lie elsewhere entirely: that what we desire, deep down, is a chance to belong to a community we can believe in.
The building of Oslo’s city hall, the radhus, began in 1930 to a design by the architects Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson, and was finally completed, after suffering delays in World War Il, in 1950. It is possibly the most elegant municipal centre ever put up, relying on pared-down modernist forms articulated in large medieval-style bricks allied inside with liberal amounts of wood panelling, brass and polished limestone. This is where the government of Oslo decides on its housing policies, where it allocates a budget for schools and kindergartens, where decisions are taken about the care of the elderly, where roads are mapped out and new kinds of traffic signs approved. Inside the main chamber, a tapestry by the artist Else Halling depicts the seven virtues of government in the hope of inspiring probity and wisdom in the assembled officials. On the west side of the building, there is a giant equestrian statue by Anne Grimdalen of the revered King Harald Ill of Norway (1015-1066), while a gigantic clock with a minimalist fascia on the east tower is visible “cross much of the capital.
It’s what the building says, as much as what is done inside it, that counts. It whispers to all who pass it that belonging to this community ene be a matter of immense and legitimate Pride. However accomplished you might be, however rich and interesting your life, this can be Secondary to your participation in the noble Soup life of the citizenry of Oslo.
The modern age typically leaves us entirely alone to make a mark solely through our own strengths. This may be a thrilling challenge for an energetic and uncommonly skilled minority, but for most of us, it is far too . much. Oslo’s city hall gives us a way out: we don’t need to do it all by ourselves. Simply by virtue of participation in the collective, we can be enhanced and our position justified. We don’t need to be unique; we can be just an ordinary citizen (perhaps we’re employed to. teach 5-year-olds how to sing, or we repair boilers in the hospital), but that the radhus is telling us is very much good enough.
In many parts of the world, what belongs to everyone may be squalid and may have associations with all that is degraded and frightening. If we live in such places, we may want desperately to avoid ‘public’ housing, healthcare and education. And as a result, we may work exceptionally hard in order to afford a car in which no one else will ever ride, to outfit our home with a spotless kitchen that no one but us will ever use and to ensure that we can die in a hospital room uncontaminated by our typical fellow humans. Oslo, however, has another lesson for the planet. Along with a few other exceptional city governments (Zurich and Amsterdam come to mind}, it lays on services that we would want to participate in whatever our levels of income and it thereby drains us of our frenetic will to insulate ourselves from the mass and to achieve a position of distinction and walled-off privacy.
In a better world, the buildings that belonged to everyone would always excead the palaces of the rich; it would be by throwing in our lot with the community that our own lives would be best justified and enhanced. We don’t really want to be special at all. We want far more importantly to live in a community we can be proud of.</p>
