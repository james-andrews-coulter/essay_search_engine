        <h2>The Rhéne Glacier</h2>
<p>One of the more tragic sights we could cast our eyes on lies just outside the hamlet of Gletsch, in the upper Valais in the centre of Switzerland. The majestic Rhdne glacier, which used to come right down into the settlement and could be seen from the elegant terrace of the Hétel Glacier du Rhone, has now retreated several kilometres up the mountainside melted remorselessly by the combined output of our boilers, hairdryers, farting cows, barbecues and steel mills. We might want to lie down in the rich alpine grass and weep without end.
The marks of our depredation are everywhere. The whole planet bears our scars. We have chopped at its forests, belched sulphuric acid into its rivers, murdered its blue whales and Siberian tigers, defaced its oceansides and darkened its skies. We struggle valiantly to apologise. We separate out our glass and our cardboard and try hard to remember to reuse our grocery bags. And yet this has some of the touching futility of attempting to stop a tank with a matchstick.
The ruination of the planet is not an incidental error into which we have somehow lapsed through inattention and technological over-enthusiasm: it is a direct and necessary consequence of who we are as people. The problem is psychological, not technical. If we are to put an end to our spoliation, we cannot simply pass a few regulations and add one or two taxes; we have to alter human nature. The issue we know as an environmental catastrophe is, once we swim a little upstream, in essence a moral crisis, an indictment of the core of our being. To heal the earth, we would need to change what we are like: we would have to Overcome our rage, our greed, our paranoiac Aggression, our stymied sympathy and our self-absorption. We would need to do what no religion, philosophy, psychotherapy or spiritual movement has ever managed to pull off since
Our emergence from the Rift Valley: turn us into substantially better people. The effort required to rewire our minds would dwarf that involved in trying to colonise a foreign galaxy.
Against such a backdrop, we should, in stronger moments, face up to a reality that for touching and sentimental reasons we keep skirting: we are unlikely to make it. The human experiment will one day run its course; our race will die out. Our chatter will eventually end. Our presses will fall silent. Our history will be erased under layers of sand and silt.
There will, of course, be much to regret. But after we have shed every last tear, we might look up from our grief with a certain stoic equanimity. That we won’t make it will be a sign, definitive and unarguable, that we did not in a key sense merit doing so. Our characters were not up to the task. Our natures could not honour the stewardship we had been handed. There remained too much folly and anger in our skittish minds. We may feel sad; we do not have to feel betrayed or incensed.
We should, along the way, take comfort from the knowledge that we will be superseded by gentler or at least more modest life forms: by billions of arachnids and myriapods, crustaceans and bacteria. The odd snow leopard might wander among the ruins. Several million years from now, a wiser, cleverer, calmer, more peaceful higher primate might emerge, and feel pity and sorrow for all that we were.
We don’t have to contemplate our residence on the planet on tenterhooks. After we have done everything we can, signed every petition, given up every harmful luxury, voted for every far-sighted politician, we can rest in the knowledge that we will either make it (and thereby prove our nobility) or we won’t, thereby demonstrating beyond doubt or sadness that we didn’t really deserve to.</p>
