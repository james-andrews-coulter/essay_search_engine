        <h2>SECULARISM</h2>
<p>To further aggravate our emotional woes, modernity has cast aside what had been, since the dawn of time, a central resource for coping with life’s vicissitudes. God has died and there is now little we can turn to, intone in front of, or beg for deliverance from when times grow hard. We dwell in a world ruled by the pitiless laws of science in which relief is on offer only from psychotherapists or psychiatric doctors, who equate our problems narrowly with our own personal histories and biology. It feels, for most of us, impossible to weep in temples and churches. We scour the universe for clues as to why we are here and what we are meant to do with our troubles, and hear back only static and silence.</p>
<p>At the same time, the disappearance of religion means that humankind looms ever larger in our own imaginations. There is nothing left to relativize us. We used to be put in our place by contact with the spiritual realm. Every weekend, we would be shepherded into gloriously rendered halls and reminded of what a puny thing mankind was, how ridiculous were all our achievements, and how flawed and frail we were next to the majesty of God. The differences between human beings were as nothing next to the differences between us and the Almighty. We were usefully relativized by the shadow of the divine.</p>
<p>Now mankind is the measure of all things. Our heroes are drawn only from our own kind, our myths reference only ourselves and our strengths. We receive few lessons in perspective and modesty, losing our sanity in the gap between what we are meant to be and what almost all of us end up remaining.</p>
