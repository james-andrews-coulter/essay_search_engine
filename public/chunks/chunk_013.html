        <h3>9. The ideal gang</h3>
<p>Gustavo, who has come straight from a board meeting, is lolling on the sofa saying something to Genevieve, whose gentle face is opening into a delighted smile, while Jo – who plays acoustic guitar in a band that hasn’t quite made it – is leaning over the back to share the joke. Noticing them, Frederika, engaged in telling Atticus something crucial about the philosophy of Spinoza, glances up and winks at Cynthia, knowing how she’ll be touched by the sofa moment. They are all friends. Jo, who dropped out of university after three months, goes swimming with Frederika (MPhil, DPhil); years ago, Genevieve was Cynthia’s favourite babysitter; Atticus is Gustavo’s dance instructor. But it’s best – and wonderful – when they are all together.</p>
<p>In films we often meet the gang in its least elegant guise: a bunch of criminals intent on a heist. But even there the allure is tangible. To find oneself part of a group of friends, so different amongst themselves but all united by deep ties of affection (and with no plan of robbery), would be utterly lovely. But it’s sadly so rare; it can feel like something merely for a utopian novel, impossible in our own lives.</p>
<p>The ideal gang invites two questions: first, why is it so especially appealing? And, second, is there anything we can do to make it less rare? How, in other words, might we form a gang of our own?</p>
<p>The starting point, as so often, is to understand a fear – namely the anxiety that often grips us when two very different friends, who we know quite independently, finally meet. The worry isn’t simply that they won’t particularly hit it off: it’s quite reasonable that not everyone is going to like everyone else. It’s rather the anxiety that they will see something horrible and disturbing in each other. In the vignette with which we started – which is a disguised description of a real group of friends – Cynthia was very fond of both Gustavo and Genevieve for years but long dreaded the idea of their meeting each other. Gustavo is wealthy, sophisticated and, in a business setting, can come across not merely as decisive but as impatient and demanding. Genevieve, the former nanny, is extremely sweet-natured but rather innocent and naive. Cynthia worried Gustavo would dismiss Genevieve as a dull, timid provincial – with nothing whatever to offer anyone over about the age of 6; he’d be (Cynthia imagined) disturbed to think of her wasting her time with this unprepossessing non-entity. And Cynthia was horrified at what her beloved Genevieve might make of Gustavo: she’d be too nice to say anything nasty, but in her heart she’d be saddened and alarmed that Cynthia was keeping company with such a harsh, soulless character.</p>
<p>The meeting did happen, eventually, at Cynthia and Frederika’s wedding. Gingerly, they sat Gustavo and Genevieve as far apart as possible. But it was incredibly touching, late in the afternoon, to see them dancing together. Gustavo was being his nicest possible self – funny, gentle, kind – and he’d clearly brought out a long-buried touch of naughtiness and daring (by her standards) in Genevieve. And this was the start of the gang.</p>
<p>A child’s life involves many divorces, in a wider sense of the term. There was a ‘divorce’ between Cynthia’s parents and her grandfather of whom she was very fond when she was little. He had run a double-glazing company; he was jolly, direct and, in her parent’s eyes, an embarrassment. They didn’t even need to say anything; Cynthia could sense her father’s shame when his father praised a dinner as ‘a slap-up meal’, whistled to indicate surprise or took to wearing a cowboy hat. Cynthia felt she was being asked to choose: would she join her parents in their distaste of his ‘vulgarity’, or would she keep faith with her warm grandfather (who did occasionally call her parents snooty)?</p>
<p>It was this fear that resurfaced around Frederika’s friend Jo. Jo wasn’t at all superficially like Cynthia’s grandfather – he shared a satirical attitude towards ‘the posh’, which in his eyes would certainly include Gustavo and, in fact, Genevieve as well. For, despite her lack of money, Genevieve has a delicacy and refinement that, Cynthia was sure, Jo would dislike. And Jo could definitely come across as rough. She saw his deep vein of tenderness – the ease with which he could be moved to tears – but many would be more struck, and turned off, by his bluntness and studded leather jacket.</p>
<p>But again, a miracle. Both Gustavo and Genevieve took to Jo. And then they all embraced Jo’s friend Atticus and four had become six. The power of the group lies in its ability to close our emotional wounds. The kinds of people we’d learnt, very painfully, couldn’t be close, turn out now – in the personae of our group of friends – to embrace one another warmly. The splits in our own soul are being cured.</p>
<p>Cynthia’s story, however, contains a troubling element: it is highly dependent on chance. It could so very easily not have happened. She speaks, in purely secular terms, of miracles because it is essentially so improbable that Gustavo would delight in Genevieve and that both of them would take to Jo and then to Atticus. This is what explains the rarity of such groups.</p>
<p>To fight against randomness and chance we require art. The arts, broadly understood, are humanity’s attempt to deliberately create good things rather than wait upon accident. The art of irrigation overcame dependence on random floods or down-pours; the art of construction liberated us from the sheer chance of finding a suitable cave in a convenient place; the art of poetry seeks to provide a more stable supply of eloquence and insight.</p>
<p>Around groups, the art in question is that of making an introduction. Usually this is an abrupt affair, hardly more than a name or a single, hopefully interesting, fact: ‘… from Uruguay’ or ‘… who I met when I was an intern at Reuters’.</p>
<p>But properly understood, an introduction is a huge thing. At its best, and most expansive, it is the attempt to teach one person how to love another. Some of the greatest novels are attempts, on the part of the writer, to introduce us properly to, and show us how to appreciate, a character who we otherwise perhaps might not much like. The entirety of War and Peace can be read as an extended introduction to the central character, Pierre; as if Tolstoy were with us at a party and said, ushering forward a very stout, rather complacent-looking individual, ‘I’d like you to meet my friend Pierre, who …’ and then recited the entire 1,000-plus pages of the book. And, at the end, we would be utterly delighted to embrace Pierre and take him into our hearts.</p>
<p>If Cynthia had thought about it, she might have tried the grand strategy of proper introduction. Right at the start, long before Gustavo and Genevieve met, she could have begun introducing them to each other. Little by little she’d have described to Gustavo how kind Genevieve had been as she was growing up; she’d have portrayed her dignity and explained her shyness. She would have searched in Gustavo for points of emotional contact. Did he have a sweet teacher at primary school? Could he imagine how nice it was for her, when she was little Cynthia, to snuggle up to such a quietly comfortable person? She’d transmit her love for Genevieve to Gustavo. It might take months or years. And she’d do the same for him to her, gradually quieting her understandable fears of such a formidable figure. The good introduction doesn’t shy away from a person’s more forbidding or disturbing aspects. Rather, it makes sense of them. And so, when they were finally to meet, it wouldn’t be an intensely anxious moment: it would be the joyful recognition of two people who had already learnt – from a distance – to understand the charm Cynthia saw in each and, now, to see it in the flesh for themselves.</p>
<p>The truth is that beautiful gangs needn’t actually be as rare as they are – the right art, if we can learn it, can set us free to be happy together.</p>
<p>Friendships within an ideal gang meet our need to close the unnecessary distances between those we love.</p>
