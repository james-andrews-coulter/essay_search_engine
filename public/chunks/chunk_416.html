        <h2>How to Deal with the Success of Friends</h2>
<p>Once we have become failures, we grow acutely conscious of the moments in everyday life in which we can sense afresh the relative good fortune of others – in the small details which, before our downfall, we would scarcely have noticed, let alone been pained by. The most routine chats will be punctuated with unexpected jabs of pain. For example, someone might mention (without any ill will) that they attended an office party, where they gave a little speech thanking their colleagues for their efforts. It might not have been any special kind of triumph – but to us it will be yet another reminder that we have been made redundant, with no hope of finding an equivalent position any time soon. Or someone might remark that they invited the neighbours round for a drink – again, scarcely a boast, but still an agonising signal of social acceptance when we have just been found guilty of fraud and the tale of our felonies is all over the papers. Or perhaps a friend alludes to something funny their teenage child told them, immediately reminding us of the coldly furious manner of our own offspring, bitter about the recent divorce. It doesn’t take much to be reminded of the scale of our problems – and the thought of how many ordinary pleasures and routines are no longer available to us. We may even feel jealous of small babies being wheeled around the park by loving parents who pause to ask them if they’d like a drink. Why can’t we be them? Why can’t our lives be simple and safe? However, instead of feeling jealous of others – friends, babies in the park – we need to feel compassion for the reasons why we aren’t them. Our parents were very different; our start set us on a far more arduous path.</p>
<p>The temptation is to make a direct comparison between the lives of others and our own: simply to wish that we could be in exactly their place. To weaken that sentiment, it helps to remind ourselves of the many ways in which we are, and always were, different from those we are presently choosing to compare ourselves to. To look across the aisle and want to swap our lives for theirs is to underestimate the many powerful – and sometimes painful – reasons why we are as we are. The particular travails of our childhood shaped us in very distinctive ways; we had to contend with challenges that others escaped. We haven’t merely coped differently with life; we have very different minds. If the people we long to swap lives with had been in our shoes, they might have failed even more gravely than we did.</p>
<p>It may seem as if we are just being envious, but it’s more nuanced than that. Envious people are aspirational – they are tortured by the thought of what they could have, whether that be greater wealth or fame, houses or love. We are more modest. We know we won’t be able to improve our lot; we are on our knees. We just wish we weren’t so alone with our peculiar kind of banishment and shame; we wish we weren’t the only ones to be thrown into despair by ordinary terms like ‘office party’, ‘holiday’, ‘cosy evening’ or ‘family’. We don’t want their joy – what we really wish (for our sake, and not because we mean them ill) is that they could have some of our misery.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we will continue to be constantly tormented until we take measures to protect ourselves. We must face up to our distinctive punishment: to keep ourselves largely apart from other people, because so-called normality is no longer our home and so hurts too much to be part of. The average party will be hell for us; it would be preferable to be sedated and locked up than to attend a school reunion. We’re going to need to change our way of socialising to take our failure into account. Excepting those few, rare individuals who are especially skilled at compassion and sympathy, we will need to separate ourselves from everyone who has not – in some significant way – also made a mess of their lives. It sounds radical and one-dimensional, but we will not be doing ourselves any favours by pretending that it is possible to keep up with people who are not comparably wounded. At this time, we are simply not strong enough to deal with the happiness of others. Dating sites and apps have learnt how to match people algorithmically by their interests: golf, comics of the 1950s, the art of Weimar Germany … It’s clear how much shared passions can matter. As failed people, we will have distinctive passions of our own that it will pay to recognise and use as the bedrocks for new forms of socialising. Having reluctantly become world experts in grief and loss, in lying in bed and weeping at our disgraced state, in going over our errors and bemoaning our idiocy, in thinking of killing ourselves and searching for reasons to go on, we should put our skills to work.</p>
<p>There is no point in continuing to spend time with people who are hoping to become partners in their law firm next year and who take their children on skiing holidays. What we need, first and foremost, are people who have banged their heads against the walls from psychological torment and who are getting by with the use of medication or therapy. Though it used to, it doesn’t really matter now what else they care or know about. Maybe our new friends never went to university or perhaps they don’t read books; they might be pushed to tell us when the Second World War took place (or what it was), or they might have had a career in armed robbery or smuggled cars across the border; maybe they spent a few years on a psychiatric ward. None of that matters in the least. All that counts is that they have suffered a lot and that they have warm and open hearts. We might surprise ourselves by how much closer these new friends become than anyone in our previous life, BF (Before Failure). There is likely to be a lot less grandstanding and one-upmanship. Everyone knows that everyone else is done for; there aren’t any prizes for showing off, there are no options to boast or impress.</p>
<p>We will be using friendship to open our hearts, explore our vulnerabilities, speak without inhibition about our insecurities and gain a sense of being helpful through assuaging the pains of others. It’s only a pity that we had to lose everything before we at last learnt what other people might be for.</p>
