            <h4>2. They deny it</h4>
<p>However hideous all the above sounds, there is an even worse kind of relationship to leave than that. This is one with the same dynamics, but with one extra twist. When you finally confront them with the problem, they don’t confess; they deny it. They tell you you’re dreaming. You’re imagining it; the problem lies with you, they say. At the same time, they become incensed and offended at the suggestion you’re making. ‘You’re so cynical about me. Don’t you trust me?! How rude you are about me! Why don’t you have more faith in me and in us?’ And they push back: ‘you’re just as neurotic as you say I am. The problem is with you and not me …’</p>
<p>This is minefield territory. Relationships and their interactions are generally not filmed, so it’s hard for you to back up your claims or even be sure of your verdicts when they are relentlessly challenged. Is the loved one spending too much money, or am I just nagging? Are they actually flirting, or am I just jealous? Are they failing to initiate sex, or am I just insecure?</p>
<p>The partner whom you love and really don’t want to leave, and who says they love you, adds to the difficulty by telling you, with authority, that you’re crazy; that you’re seeing things; that you’re too demanding; that there’s something wrong with you …</p>
<p>You are probably an open-minded, nice, intelligent person – and open-minded, nice, intelligent people tend to give others the benefit of the doubt. After all, such types know they aren’t perfect. They’re aware of everything they get wrong; they don’t feel they are brilliant in every way. Perhaps it’s plausible that here, too, you may be seeing things that aren’t really there. Why insist, especially when you love your partner and want to be with them? Here is a nice person telling you that you’re a bit mad and imagining things. It’s a dispiriting message, but if disregarding your impulses (and your emotional needs) is the price you pay for keeping a relationship aloft, maybe it’s worth thinking of yourself as a bit insane. At least you’ll still have a partner.</p>
<p>So, more time passes, and you stay put. In that time, probably there are more children, more entanglements and less of life left for you to build on afterwards. There is also likely to be a destruction of your sense of reality. You will probably start to feel as mad as you’re being subtly told you are. You might have a breakdown – which isn’t an ideal backdrop against which to leave anyone.</p>
<p>All that said, in both of the above cases, you will have to leave eventually. Your long-term mental well-being depends on it. You will feel extremely alone with this decision. You will be left to wrestle either with feelings that you are nasty (for leaving someone who promises again and again to change) or that you are mad (for leaving someone who tells you that you’re demented to doubt their sincerity). You will have to destroy a relationship on the basis of an inner sense that your partner is doing something detrimental to your well-being and cannot stop themselves from doing it, despite telling you they love you.</p>
<p>In order to leave, you will need to think: ‘I am in love with someone who is damaged. They cannot realistically change and may even be using me as a reason not to change. Or they are in denial and are abusing my credulity and self-doubt not to look more honestly into themselves.’ You will have to think: ‘there is probably something in my past, a history of putting up with intolerable situations, that makes me a long-term sucker for this sort of suffering.’</p>
<p>Mountain climbers know that certain peaks cannot be climbed alone; you need a climbing buddy. In this context, let’s call them a psychotherapist or a very good friend – the sort who can reassure you of your sanity and who can be there for you when you feel as if you’re making the worst choice in the world, even though you are making the very best decision of your life.</p>
