        <h2>1. Hidden Calendars</h2>
<p>The Country Diaries, edited by Alan Taylor (Canongate Books, 2010), is one of the best compendiums of historical and contemporary rural anecdote that I have come
  across.</p>
<p>The Morville Year, by Katherine Swift (Bloomsbury, 2011), is the best gardening book I have read. By looking at her garden over the course of a year, Swift gives us the opportunity to
  see seasonal change through the eyes of a passionate expert on her patch.</p>
<p>Wild Hares and Humming Birds, by Stephen Moss (Square Peg, 2011), is a very enjoyable view of an English village, seen through an expert naturalist’s eyes over the course of the
  year.</p>
