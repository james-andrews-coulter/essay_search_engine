        <h4>DID YOU HAVE A NICE WEEKEND?</h4>
<p>Some of what makes office life awkward is that it asks us to tread a fine line between being, on the one hand, efficient and focused and, on the other, genial and human. We mustn’t appear robotic, but nor should we gush naively in a boundary-less way. This is especially important in relation to a number of stock enquiries that we are likely to face, one of the most inevitable of which is: Did you have a nice weekend? How we handle such a question is a minor but key indicator of how well we have made our peace with the delicate compromises and hypocrisies of professional existence.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is exactly the kind of question that you could be asked by a close friend – or your psychotherapist. Chatting in a café, or lying on the couch, you might explain that things were not going well with your partner. The painful issue is that you’re not having much sex any more. This has been leading to a lot of arguments. On Saturday morning, feeling rejected, you picked a fight about how dirty the kitchen was, focusing on the fridge especially. That meant your partner was resentful about needing to see your friends from Canada in the evening. By Sunday afternoon, you were rethinking your whole relationship, questioning your career, doubting what happened to you in your childhood and wondering whether life was essentially a cruel joke. You also had a stomach upset because of a prawn sandwich you had at lunch on the Sunday. And how was your weekend?</p>
<p>Evidently, if you were to launch into such a rendition at 9.03am with your colleague from sales, you would soon overstep the limits of their curiosity and good will and be marked down as a garrulous, naive, frightening, depressive egotist. Being professional means, willingly denying the complexities of being human.</p>
<p>One response to the tension between the sincere and the professional is to treat small talk with disdain and give almost nothing away. In response to your enquiry about the weekend, you might look at your colleague as if they had said something inappropriate and enquire, with a cold degree of puzzlement: ‘why do you ask?’ Being inquisitive about a colleague’s weekend could be framed as a species of sinister curiosity, as if a police officer had asked what you’d been up to on your Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Office life makes some peculiar demands of us. We cannot be properly ourselves, but nor can we be entirely faceless either. We are likely to be part of a group of almost random strangers of varied ages and backgrounds who have been temporarily aligned in the pursuit of money. But we are, nevertheless, called upon to treat each other with tolerance, kindness and empathy. We are meant both to care and not really to care. This is a dance, and a taxing one for those among us who prize sincerity and authenticity. What is going on in someone’s inner world, how their new puppy is, or the state of their relationship is not relevant to anything on the agenda – and yet, because these belong to the reality of the participants, nor are they irrelevant either. They need to be touched, but not settled, on.</p>
<p>The question about what sort of weekend a colleague had is not purely fake: the asker isn’t just complying with a convention that they regard as ridiculous; they do want to know something. Calibrating the answer well emerges from an understanding of the point of the question.</p>
<p>Your colleague isn’t keen to know the details of your life outside the office. But just below the surface, small talk performs an important function. It is a tool of orientation. It allows the bare bones of another’s situation to emerge, so that – were it to be necessary – one would know who to call in an emergency and what guesses to make about someone’s behaviour. It allows for a rough estimate of character; it tells us how attuned someone might be to group dynamics; how they might react in a crisis, and how competitive or trustworthy they might prove. Not least, both the raising and the answering of small talk signals a mutual commitment to civility within the otherwise chilly bounds of commercial life.</p>
<p>→Pretty good; I was down on the water with some friends.</p>
<p>Lovely to get away from it all. And you?</p>
<p>Modern capitalism has moved work in two contradictory directions. On the one hand, it has made it evident that we are individuals competing for economic survival in a ruthless and unforgiving environment; on the other hand, it has identified that the psychological well-being and mental health of employees has a minor but critical role to play in the success of every firm.</p>
<p>We should not resent our colleagues for not being our friends, but nor should we make the mistake of thinking that they are. We should forgive the world of work for placing us at a tantalising midpoint between the human and the instrumental.</p>
<p>→Do you think you’ll be doing anything nice next weekend?</p>
