            <h2>Fear and Fame</h2>
<p>However attractive the life of famous people may seem from afar, from close up, it is usually a very different story. Something like the following scenario is, at some stage in their career, uncommonly likely to unfold.</p>
<p>From the outside, all will appear to be going well. The reviews are ecstatic. The money is flowing in. The hotels are sumptuous and the private jets impeccable. The fans are eager and the dinner invitations from celebrity friends are constant. And yet, inside the mind of the famous person, there is turmoil on a scale unsuspected by almost everyone in the entourage. It started with a little niggle, but now it is a full-blown state of anxiety that begins at dawn and doesn’t let up until the early hours. The famous person, beneath the smiles and the polished routines, will be contemplating the ruin of everything that they have worked for since the start. They will be imagining what might happen if a rival gets an advantage, if they make a mistake, if the critics turn against them. They will be haunted by spectres of disgrace and apprehensions of scandal. They will picture themselves having to give up the jet and take a bus. They will imagine their savings eroded and their name becoming a byword for shame.</p>
<p>Unable to take the panic, they might take to drink, grow intensely irritable and develop a dependence on drugs. It might seem somehow unusual and unwarranted; it is – in reality – entirely predictable.</p>
<p>It is extremely rare to want to be very famous without an accompanying fear of invisibility and neglect. Fame is a salve invented by the traumatised to compensate for an early experience of unbearable let-down. No one who hadn’t suffered from a sense of worthlessness – one that has not been understood or worked through – would actively wish to be known by so many complete strangers.</p>
<p>Too often, the late-night panic of the famous results in a vow to become yet more successful and yet more well known. That, they feel, will surely quieten the fears at last. But peace of mind can never be won in this way. Ironically, however, being ever more famous just leads to more enemies, sniping, envy and the risk of scandal.</p>
<p>The only plausible route to safety is to become better acquainted with the original feeling of unacceptability that powered the aspiration to become exceptional – and to understand that maybe they never really wanted to be known to everyone, but rather they just wanted the love of a few very important people who (almost certainly) appeared to have better things to do or were too mentally unwell to be able to provide care.</p>
<p>No one ever really desires fame; they want – first and foremost – to feel loved. Fame for a time appears as though it may deliver on the original aspiration, but in reality, all it provides is paranoia and a continuous terror of downfall. The famous will truly have succeeded when they are able to walk away from being ‘known’ and towards the safety of being loved and seen by just one or two sets of eyes.</p>
