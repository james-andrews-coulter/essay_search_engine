        <h3>(i) Nondefensiveness</h3>
<p>An ingrained tendency</p>
<p>One of the most basic features of our natures is that we are defensive. That is, we seek to ward off psychic pain and defend ourselves against perceived attacks. Our minds are squeamish. We try to uphold a bearable picture of ourselves in the face of any possible insights or criticisms that others may direct towards us (or that could emanate from the more perceptive recesses of our own minds). We are not keen on feedback. Our defensiveness is a profoundly understandable tendency. And yet it is also behind a predominant share of the failure of all relationships.</p>
<p>Why defensiveness throttles love</p>
<p>However sweet and fascinating two people might initially be, it is inescapable that they will also, with time and the birth of true intimacy, stumble upon aspects of one another’s characters that cannot help but generate difficulties and a degree of dismay. Each partner could be determined to be only kind, but the way that they shell an egg, leave the bathroom, deal with their suitcase on returning from a trip, handle the household keys or tell an anecdote will gradually unleash powerful degrees of frustration or puzzlement in those they must share their lives with.</p>
<p>The problem starts when we, as partners, venture to air how we feel. We might start out politely and tentatively. We may gently mention the strands of hair in the basin or the muddled telling of anecdotes in front of strangers. But thoughtful receptivity can be hard to come by. Our partner is in danger of treating our remarks as if they were a direct attack, not as comments about something a sound adult could ever really be bothered by; they might go strangely quiet or immediately accuse us of being hugely unkind or malevolently judgemental. Or they might slyly turn the tables and start listing – with less and less good humour – certain things that they find awful about us and that they have been holding on to privately for a long time. Whatever strategy they adopt, the underlying meaning tends to be the same: that being found in some way imperfect is entirely unacceptable and deeply contrary to the spirit of true love.</p>
<p>‘Love me for who I am’ is the fateful rallying cry of all lovers headed for disaster; it is in reality a monstrously unfair (though entirely understandable) demand to be loved just as we are, with all our panoply of faults, compulsions and immaturities. But with a modicum of self-awareness and honesty, we should only ever expect to be loved for who we hope to be, for who we are in our best moments, for the good that lies in us in a latent and yet not-realised state.</p>
<p>The spirit of true love should require that whenever there is feedback, we turn gratefully to our partner and ask for more, that we continuously search to access a better version of ourselves, that we see love as a classroom in which our lover can teach us one or two things about who we should become – rather than as a burrow in which our existing errors can be sentimentally endorsed and encouraged.</p>
<p>Where defensiveness comes from</p>
<p>In order to overcome defensiveness, we need to understand its sources; we have to think about defensiveness not in its obdurate, dismaying present manifestations but in its greatly more benevolent and engaging origins. Defensiveness is almost invariably founded on an intimate history that no defensive person consciously chose and that – compassionately recounted – might move us to tears. Defensiveness is a legacy of early pain. There might have been a shy 6-year-old with a robust, confident parent who was ashamed of their timid, lonely child. No one much seemed to care for this soft-cheeked, large-eyed creature at home. There were criticisms and hints that another sibling was favoured. Love, as this poor soul encountered it, was a scarce, easily lost commodity. For anything to be pointed out to them was (as they came to think) a harbinger of fresh contempt and renewed exclusion from everything sustaining and kind. Or else a parent was intermittently admiring and then terrifyingly angry at their offspring if there was the slightest drop in their performance at school.</p>
<p>Defensive people did not magically acquire their ferocity in relation to our comments; they suffered some form of early neglect or encounter with unsteady, fluctuating warmth. No wonder such a person might respond with alarm, even viciousness, when the slightest negative thought about them rears its head in a lover they felt ready to entrust with their whole being. There could – in the mind of the unfortunate sufferer – plainly be no such thing as affectionate criticism, no such thing as helpful feedback, no possibility of being at once adored and upbraided. Love cannot be conceived of as coexisting alongside occasional moments of evaluation. It is on the basis of such awkward, emotionally scarred internal associations that defensiveness is built.</p>
<p>Unwinding defensiveness</p>
<p>A less-defended attitude isn’t a random gift; it is something we can aim for, every bit as much as we can aim for a flatter stomach or a tidier house. Even if we didn’t have an ideal introduction to life, we can access ideas that dismantle the equation between love-worthiness and untouchable perfection. We can begin to become less defensive when we take some of the following ideas on board:</p>
<p>Our early experience isn’t a guide to the present: Our defences were the best we could do in the face of early harshness. We were confronted with problems and demands far beyond our strength. But a decent partner, if we let them know our background troubles, will be moved by our tender desperation and hasty fear. And they can, so long as we master our panic, help us to see that the thing we should be afraid of now is not criticism but an inability to accept its occasional kindly manifestations.</p>
<p>By the background standard of the defensive person, no one could ever be loved: If love really required an absence of even the most minor flaws, no one could possibly qualify for a relationship. Yet, in reality, we are love-worthy not because we are perfect but because none of us ever can be.</p>
<p>Irritation isn’t objective: We need not feel overly targeted by criticism. Every partner has their own particular fixations and preoccupations that mean they will latch on to certain features of another’s character. That a partner is annoyed with us over something is no sign that we are doing anything appalling per se, and so we can afford to feel unpersecuted by their judgement. Some people wouldn’t mind a messy cupboard; not everyone cares about a lengthy anecdote. An issue can be worth discussing amicably not because it is a fundamental failing but simply because it happens to bother someone we love.</p>
<p>Love isn’t fragile: In the defensive person’s mind, the smallest comment is like the small rockfall that announces an avalanche. There seems to be no way to trust that it really is just about how long pasta should be cooked for, or the right way to make a bed – the underlying intention seems always to be to inflict a devastating wound and speed the entire relationship to a close. The defensive person has not had a chance to experience the robustness of love; how it is wholly possible to call someone the worst names in the lexicon and then, ten minutes later, want to lie softly in their arms, tenderness having been renewed and reinvigorated by an opportunity to purge frustration. There can be ruptures – and repair. True love is resilient; it is not destroyed by a detail but only ever by the way that a detail can’t be acknowledged or processed.</p>
<p>Defensiveness can be outgrown. We can learn to measure in our hearts the difference between a complaint and an existential rejection; we can come to hear a criticism without connecting it to damnation. That love once seemed fragile doesn’t mean it must be today. We can trust that we may on occasion irritate a partner without concluding that they will therefore hate everything about us into eternity.</p>
<p>When searching for a partner, we need to look out for someone who can join us in the noble quest to recognise and overcome defensiveness. We might even raise this ambition on an early date (‘I’d like one day to move to the country, learn Spanish and, with a lover’s help, get over my defensiveness,’ we might declare by way of introduction to our goals). We could frame the attempt to listen to criticism without fury or hurt as one of life’s mightiest challenges – alongside sporting excellence or business success. Eventually, with a lot of effort, we would hope to reach a stage when a partner could point out with tact and humanity that we had bad breath or that our shoes didn’t match our jumper and, rather than reacting as we have grown up to do, we could simply turn to them, smile benignly and say what flawed humans should always respond with when another member of the species deigns to help them to grow into a better version of themselves: ‘Thank you.’</p>
