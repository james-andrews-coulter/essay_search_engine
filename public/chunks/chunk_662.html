        <h3>¶ Rock Appreciation</h3>
<p>It might strike us as odd to put a smallish rock in a place of honour on a pedestal. It’s not that we hate rocks; it’s just that we don’t normally find them very interesting. But in China things have been very different: for centuries, poets and artists have been obsessed with the varied charms of irregularly shaped and strikingly coloured lumps of stone.</p>
<p>The poet Mi Fu liked to pay compliments to a dramatically weathered rock and wrote tenderly about its resilience and dignity. The most favoured rocks were dark and glossy, quarried from the limestone of Lingbi, in the northern Anhui province. The best examples might cost as much as a house.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this tradition, we might start to pay a lot more admiring attention to the rocks we ourselves happen to come across. But we’d have to go to China for this inspiration, because our culture doesn’t offer us many prompts of encouragement in this rock direction. Our culture has, however, taken great pains to get us to see what might be nice about other things: the pleasures of fine dining, attending the Olympic opening ceremony or flying business class. But when we encounter the tradition of rock homage in China, we are alerted to how many other things still remain to be appreciated in a host of areas of life, if only we were invited to turn our gaze towards them and given a few guiding hints about what to look for.</p>
<p>Our lives are, in part, a search for pleasure. The irony is that we may, via a limited culture, be missing many sources of great enjoyment that are readily available and within our reach –including the occasional lump of limestone or granite.</p>
<p>Guo Xu, Mi Fu Honouring a Rock, 1503.</p>
<p>The poet Mi Fu was one of many Chinese appreciators of the beauty of weathered rock.</p>
<p>The fact that the special qualities of rocks are often overlooked in Western culture indicates just how many things in life could benefit from our attention and appreciation.</p>
