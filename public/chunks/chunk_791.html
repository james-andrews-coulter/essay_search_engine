        <h2>AUTHENTIC WORK</h2>
<p>We may have to go back as far as childhood to ask: What did I really enjoy doing? When did I feel most alive? There may be clues to what our future should be in the way we used to play as small children, when impressing and earning money were far from our minds.</p>
<p>We should allow ourselves to think in original ways, casting aside any prejudices about what a respectable or reasonable job might be. We should be unbothered by fears of failing, for this is a seam we have now fully explored. We should go back to what work should always have been for us, which is a source of intrinsic satisfaction, before it got saddled with the task of assuring us of our value as a human being in the eyes of an imagined hostile and skeptical audience.</p>
<p>HELPING</p>
<p>Our mental troubles will have opened up fresh territories of pain for us. We’ll be aware from first-hand experience that a whole subsection of the population is laboring under mental torment and we may be newly motivated to help them as others have helped us.</p>
<p>We may be able to use our own history of pain to help strangers in their agony, lending our time, empathy, love, and curiosity. We may have doubted that we could ever be of true use to anyone—we fell ill partly because of a basic sense of superfluity. But by targeting work where helping others in grave distress is the priority, we can derive a visceral sense of the difference we can make to someone else’s world. We may not be earning as much and people at large may not care a jot, but we’ll have all the affirmation we need for ourselves in the knowledge that we are—on a good day—able to lend someone else a reason to live.</p>
