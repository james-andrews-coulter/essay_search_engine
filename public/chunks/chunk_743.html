        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>1.     Name a ‘weird’ sexual desire you have (if only in your mind).</p>
<p>2.     Outline in as much detail as possible the steps and stages by which this desire evolved in you.</p>
<p>3.     How might you explain this desire to a partner?</p>
<p>4.     If there has been an affair, the straying partner should explain their motivations. To what extent did this infidelity come about from a fruitless attempt to complain about a shortfall in affection from the betrayed person?</p>
<p>5.     How else might you feel that affection and tenderness could be offered other than via sex?</p>
<p>6.     It may not be your fantasy ideal, but how could you perhaps – to your surprise – manage really quite well in a sexless relationship so long as there was a plentiful supply of certain other things as well? What would these things need to be? Are they present now?</p>
