        <h2>Vow five:</h2>
<p>I understand that sex will often only be as good as it can be: it won’t be everything I might fantasise it could be. I acknowledge that there will be areas of my sexuality that don’t make sense to you; I promise I will try not to make you feel bad about this. END</p>
<p>The point of these mutual vows is not to diminish sexuality. By keeping the realistically bad prospects in view and anticipating them, they give a couple a better chance to find the best sex they can together. The danger isn’t that there will be challenges: that is inevitable. It is that the challenges will be seen as unfair and unreasonable and that resentment will build up to disastrous levels. The wedding night and its vows are aimed at reducing rancour.</p>
