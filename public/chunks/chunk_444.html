        <h3>¶ Bad Taste</h3>
<p>In matters of design and decoration, it has grown taboo to accuse anyone of having ‘bad taste’. The official story is that no one knows what good or bad taste might be and that every taste must be of equal validity.</p>
<p>Yet this appears both untrue to experience and lacking in ambition. To make progress, we should begin by considering the psychological mechanisms that govern the business of taste. We need to consider the theory of artistic rebalancing. We are all somewhat unbalanced inside and grow attracted to artistic styles that promise to compensate us for, or ‘correct’, the things we lack within. This explains why people who feel chaotic, undisciplined and cluttered inside are liable to be drawn to interiors that are serene, pure and poised. Equally, people who are exposed to, and oppressed by, the hurried tempo of modern life are often drawn to styles that speak of the rustic and the natural.</p>
<p>What singles out ‘bad taste’ is merely that the desire for compensation has grown particularly acute because the deprivation has been correspondingly intense. Those who have experienced crushing poverty will, if the opportunity arises, often adopt a gaudy style derived from the most gilded aspects of the palace of Versailles. Those whose lives are excessively harsh may favour garden gnomes, enormous and brightly coloured stuffed toys and sentimental trinkets.</p>
<p>In every instance of bad taste, we find an over-eager embracing of a good quality – sweetness, freedom, fun or prosperity – that is, or once was, in very short supply in the owner’s life. Bad taste can appal, but once one understands its origins, sympathy is a more appropriate response.</p>
<p>What is ‘bad’ in bad taste is not the person, but the prior difficulty for which they are seeking to compensate through their décor. There is no point in mocking or offering lectures about art history. The problem isn’t a lack of information. It is a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world. Therefore, the solution to bad taste is, in the broad sense, political. Good taste comes about when people feel appreciated, when there’s enough to go around and when there’s an economy that doesn’t routinely humiliate and abase its members. To make good taste more widespread, what matters above all are efforts to diminish the desperate lives in which lapses of taste invariably have their origins.</p>
