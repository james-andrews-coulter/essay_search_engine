        <h3>Kindness</h3>
<p>The most common reason why people are unkind is that they cannot imagine how they might end up suffering from certain ills: they can’t picture themselves becoming homeless, losing their temper, saying something idiotic online or getting into trouble over sex. Because of this, they naturally aren’t in a position to extend sympathy to those who have failed in these areas; those people must simply be idiots or reprobates – human in a technical sense, but not creatures with any humanity worth honouring. The moralists who think this way aren’t so much unkind as unimaginative. Experience of failure offers a crash course in how decent people (that is, all of us from a sufficient distance) might end up in an appalling place – a lesson that becomes applicable across all areas of mishap. Once we have failed, we can feel pain from the inside. Suffering of all kinds becomes our area of expertise; all distress becomes relatable (how unkind are people who have been happy all their lives). We can picture just what it might be like to have a painful hip as a 90-year-old or to have been told off for eating too many sweets as a 4-year-old – even to be a sparrow that has lost its way home or a squirrel longing for nuts in midwinter. When we read the paper, every unfortunate ‘cheater’ or ‘reject’ is someone whose story we can understand and empathise with. We have become kind not out of some superhuman goodness: we just want, for our own sake, to spare everyone we encounter a modicum of the pain we have had to suffer. Our kindness is solidly grounded in self-interest: it hurts us to see someone else in pain.</p>
