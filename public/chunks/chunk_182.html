        <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
<p>There are many people who will cajole you to take an interest in nature because they see this as a necessary part of a broader environmental goal. I am not one of them and
  this book is not part of that benevolent drumbeat. Of course everybody wants to live in a sustainable environment, in the same way that nobody of right mind wants war. Some people are more
  passionate about it than others, but no sane person likes to see the planet irrevocably harmed.</p>
<p>In this book I am imploring you to connect with nature for a different reason. This reason is that it is the best possible deal out there. A strong connection with nature will give you a much
  more interesting experience, every minute you spend outdoors. That is one side of the deal. The other side is that this connection will make you a more interesting and effective person. I know that
  is a bold, if not arrogant statement, but I do mean it. Have you ever found yourself talking to somebody who is so engrossed in the practical details of life that you find it hard to connect with
  them? Perhaps the person who talks about their plans for developing their property without relenting? Or the one who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing?</p>
<p>Have you ever lost interest in somebody because they are so enthralled by their own philosophical view of an issue that they cannot see the real world around them? I’m thinking of the
  person who corners you to discuss problems in the developing world, oblivious to the fact there is a young child playing with a sharp knife next to them.</p>
<p>The joy of discovering a deep connection with nature is that it allows each of us to see each living thing, object and idea within its own intricate network. It allows us to view things in the
  most practical and philosophical way simultaneously. There is no other field that I am aware of that does this. We can look at a plant as a source of food, and as a key to appreciating a moment in
  time – at the same time.</p>
<p>The desire to connect with nature is not commonplace. Most people remain oblivious to the sounds of the birds all around them. They can ignore the most exquisite form of a
  wildflower and fail to find any beauty in the insect by their feet. ‘Surely,’ we might hear them say, ‘only those geologists who have opted out of society can find a rock
  interesting.’ This is the ordinary view. It is a view held by a lot of people who would be happy to have more interesting lives.</p>
<p>Since you are reading this book, you take the extraordinary view. You either suspect or already know that feeling a connection with nature has the potential to be an exciting and meaningful
  experience. Perhaps you have a desire to rediscover a lost connection: if we go back far enough we all find there was once a bond. It is found for many in memories of childhood, but we can be
  certain of finding it by going back further still, to our ancestors.</p>
<p>Later in the book I will argue that the stimulation a full connection with nature can bring to each person is life-enhancing to the point where it changes who we are. However, there are a few
  steps to take before that small leap and in Part II of the book I will introduce each of these. In Part III we will explore each step more fully and in Part IV we will look at the importance of
  understanding the concept of time in nature. The fifth and final part of the book covers the wild philosophical places these steps can lead to.</p>
