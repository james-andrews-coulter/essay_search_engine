        <h4>THANK YOU FOR DINNER</h4>
<p>Life continually requires that we write down a few words of thanks: for holidays, meals, presents or parties. However, too often, our messages end up flat or unconvincing; we say that the dinner was ‘nice’, the present ‘brilliant’ and the holiday ‘the best ever’, all of which may be true while failing to get at what truly touched or moved us.</p>
<p>To render our messages more effective, we should take a lesson from an unexpected quarter: the history of art. Many paintings and poems are, in effect, a series of thank you notes to parts of the world. They are thank yous for the sunset in springtime, a river valley at dawn, the last days of autumn or the face of a loved one. What distinguishes great from mediocre art is the level of detail with which the world has been studied. A talented artist is, first and foremost, someone who takes us into the specifics of the reasons why an experience or place felt valuable. They don’t merely tell us that spring is ‘nice’, they zero in on the particular contributing factors to this niceness: leaves that have the softness of a newborn’s hands, the contrast between a warm sun and a sharp breeze, the plaintive cry of baby blackbirds.</p>
<p>The more an artist moves from generalities to specifics, the more the scene comes alive in our minds. A great painter goes beneath a general impression of pleasure in order to select and emphasise the truly attractive features of the landscape: they show the sunlight filtering through the leaves of the trees and reflecting off of a pool of water in the road; they draw attention to the craggy upper slopes of a mountain or the way a sequence of ridges and valleys opens up in the distance. They’ve asked themselves with unusual rigour what it is that they particularly appreciated about a scene and faithfully transcribed their most salient impressions.</p>
<p>An effective thank you note might have some of the following ingredients:</p>
<p>→i. A determination to break clichés</p>
<p>You are both so close to my heart. Too often when I go out, I get bored, return home, take off my socks and wonder what it was all about – and why we make such efforts for nothing. But that was the literal opposite of what I experienced on returning from your house.</p>
<p>→ii. A little hyperbole</p>
<p>You did nothing less than rekindle my enthusiasm for humanity.</p>
<p>→iii. Colour</p>
<p>And in the company of one of the best paellas I’ve ever tasted and some of the liveliest and kindest people one could hope to meet.</p>
<p>→iv. Details</p>
<p>It’s the stickiness of the rice that normally lets everything down. But yours was substantial, sweet and tangy without being overwhelming; and adding that touch of crab was so deft and bold.</p>
<p>→v. Discoveries</p>
<p>You were properly thoughtful to put me next to someone who had such an original take on things – and managed to tease me about my shoes as well (she was right!).</p>
<p>→vi. Brevity &amp; intensity</p>
<p>I know how much work goes into an evening like that. You’re the epitome of grace and kindness. I love you – and want to see more of you very soon.</p>
<p>Praise works best the more specific it can be. We know this in love; the more a partner can say what it is they appreciate about us, the more real their affection will feel.</p>
<p>The person who has given a dinner party or sent us a present is no different. They too hunger for praise in its specific rather than general forms. We don’t have to be great artists to send effective thank you notes: we just need to locate and hold on tightly to two or three highly detailed reasons for our gratitude.</p>
