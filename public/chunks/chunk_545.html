        <h3>¶ Anger</h3>
<p>We start to reduce the danger of anger through the insight that not everything that makes us sad makes us angry. We may be irritated that it is raining, but we are unlikely ever to respond to a shower by screaming. We aren’t overwhelmed by anger whenever we are frustrated; we are sent into a rage only when we first allowed ourselves to believe in a hopeful scenario that was then dashed suddenly and apparently without warning. Our greatest furies spring from unfortunate events that we had not factored into our vision of reality.</p>
<p>We typically think of anger as a dark and pessimistic state of mind. But behind anger lies a surprising emotion: optimism. Beneath their ranting, the angry are possessed of some recklessly optimistic notions of how life might go. They are not merely in a destructive fury; they are in the grip of hope.</p>
<p>The person who shouts every time they encounter a traffic jam betrays a faith, at once touching and demented, that roads must always be traffic-free. The person who loses their temper with every new employee or partner evinces a curious belief that perfection is an option for the human animal.</p>
<p>Serenity therefore begins with pessimism. We must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before the world ever has a chance to slap us by surprise at a time of its own choosing. The angry must learn to check their fury via a systematic, patient surrender of their more fervent hopes. They need to be carefully inducted into the darkest realities of life, to the stupidities of others, to the ineluctable failings of technology, to the necessary flaws of infrastructure. They should start each day with a short yet thorough premeditation on the many humiliations and insults to which the coming hours risk subjecting them.</p>
<p>One of the goals of civilisation is to instruct us in how to be sad rather than angry. Sadness may not sound very appealing, but in this context it carries a huge advantage. It allows us to detach our emotional energies from fruitless fury around things that (however bad) we cannot change and that are the fault of no-one in particular and – after a period of mourning – to refocus our efforts in places where our few remaining hopes and expectations have a realistic chance of success.</p>
