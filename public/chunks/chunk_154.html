        <h2>2.What Is ‘Exotic’?</h2>
<p>Our societies have a strong sense of what makes a destination ‘exotic’. Normally, the word is associated with palm trees, temples to unfamiliar gods, humid heat and unknown animals.</p>
<p>But, stripped to its essence, ‘exotic’ has nothing to do with the prescriptive list of places with which it is typically associated. It merely means anywhere we yearn to go which we suspect has something important to teach us. Each of us is likely to have a private atlas of destinations that sound exotic to our ears, and which we need the courage and patience to unearth and bring into focus. The exotic is evidence of what is missing in ourselves.</p>
<p>We might be inspired to follow our own definitions of exoticism by the example of the nineteenth-century politician and writer Benjamin Disraeli. In one of his novels, Coningsby, the central character – a thinly disguised version of the author – develops a fascination for the factories and heavy industry of northern England. Though he and his friends have been used to holidaying in the countryside, the narrator admits that what would be truly exotic for him would be to go and spend two weeks investigating steel mills, cotton factories and coal mines. He does so, and the experience transforms him into a more serious and resolute person.</p>
<p>The modern equivalent would be someone cancelling a break in southern Spain to take a life-expanding trip to the appliance factories of the Ruhr valley or the data-storage centres of Montana.</p>
<p>Sadly, too often, we’re shy about investigating what might really be exotic to us. We may end up in more clichéd ‘exotic’ places from a shyness about locating and declaring our true interests. We’re often still at the dawn of properly knowing ourselves. At least we can be assured that no one will mock or say we’re weird if we reveal we’re off to Phuket or Barbados. But what is properly exotic to us might lie somewhere quite different, in the suburbs of Yokohama, a hilltop retreat in Bavaria or the Norwegian hamlet of Sveagruva.</p>
<p>We should dare to ask ourselves what feels properly exotic to us – even if it has no palm tree anywhere in the vicinity and occupies no space in any brochure – and ensure we have the resolve to pay proper homage to it in our next itinerary.</p>
