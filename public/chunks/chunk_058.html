        <h2>Prayer</h2>
<p>At moments of special stress, we could lie in bed and pray, and the god would be there, somewhere in the darkened room, to listen. We would ask that our loved ones wouldn’t have to suffer, that our career wouldn’t be destroyed, that our relationship could be saved. Before a challenge, in the waiting room of the doctor’s surgery, in the green room before a speech, we would ask that it could all be OK – and know that our god was there listening to our petitions and ready to bend reality for us.</p>
