        <h2>Calvary Cemetery</h2>
<p>Behind the cemetery are some of the most driven, clever, productive, ruthless and cynical people ever to have been gathered into a single space in the history of humankind. On the island of Manhattan, we don’t exist beyond the money and fame we accrue; there is no friendship or pity; everyone is longing to see everyone else disgraced; people are proud of their cynicism; we need to triumph rapidly or leave town.
It’s to defend ourselves against the fear and panic induced by this terrifying piece of real estate that we should take a subway out to Calvary Cemetery in Queens: 365 acres tightly filled with the bodies of military heroes, Wall Street titans, Fifth Avenue princesses and the ordinary heart attack and cancer victims of the northeastern United States. It might sound sad to spend a few hours communing with the dead in this way, but it may in these parts be a great deal more reviving than attempting to connect with the living. Amidst the graves, there is at least room for sympathy; there is space for thoughtfulness and tenderness; no one mentions an IPO.
Everyone whatever their wealth slips into a similar-sized coffin. The most famous and awe-inspiring are reliably forgotten within two generations, and every corpse, however large its last tax return, is quickly gnawed at by similar armies of undiscriminating worms. Death is beautifully democratic; to microbiotic life, the Upper East Side tastes much the same as the Bronx. The former leave exclusive penthouses on Park Avenue feet first in the morning and, by evening, are interred for eternity in a plot no larger than one of their former bathtubs. Everyone is silent; there is no more gossip; the journalists have gone; the invitations dry up.
The largest cities of modernity excel in their power to shatter our sincerity and peace of mind. It becomes impossible not to worry that we have been excluded, and not to wake up from nightmares about our downfalls. We know that we should leave time for introspection, creativity and vulnerable conversation, but we are too scared to remember how to begin. We forget all that is gentle and touching and that we understood so well when we were 5. We cannot turn away from a media which appals us with news of never-ending threats to our reputations and livelihoods. We know we can never be loved outside of what we can boast about at dinner.
The cemetery cares nothing for all of this. It bids us to sit on a bench and commune for a while with its stable and heartfelt verities. It asks us to live in such a way that we do not dishonour ourselves from the perspective of death. We should worry only about those things that still seem serious when contemplated from the far side of the grave. We should measure our thoughts against the implied verdicts of a skeleton.
We can be grateful for the dead of Queens for trying to save us from the living of Manhattan.</p>
