            <h1>2. Fast Change</h1>
<p>‘How can that nasty little machine possibly know what the great golden Sun is up to?’</p>
<p>(OSCAR WILDE)</p>
<p>The writer Jay Griffiths spent six months living with the Karen tribe in Northern Thailand. She was the only one wearing a watch, but bizarrely, she felt she was the only one
  who could never really tell what the time was. The Karen were sensitive to the shifts in light, temperature and sound, and this gave them a more fundamental understanding of time than a watch
  could: ‘the forest over the course of a day supplied a symphony of time, provided you knew the score.’</p>
<p>This is a beautiful idea, but knowing the score is a bigger challenge than those three words might suggest. I would guess that the Karen themselves don’t know the
  ‘score’. They have most likely amassed enough experience for their understanding of time to lie deeper in their minds than ‘knowledge’, which sits closer to the surface.
  This is a concept that I encounter regularly in navigation: if, from memory, you try to make a list of all the twists and turns you take on a regular long journey, you will almost certainly miss
  one or two. And yet if you undertake the journey, you do not get lost. Our experience and understanding of many aspects of our surroundings is contextual. This book has the words
  ‘How to’ at the start of the title, so it is my job to try to shortcut this process of long-term accumulation of experience. Advice like ‘go native for five years’ would be
  a lazy and unhelpful solution to this problem. How can we learn to appreciate time like the Karen without turning our lives upside down? Fortunately some practical techniques are available.</p>
<p>In my natural navigation courses I try to make sure that everyone leaves with one question added to their daily routine: ‘Which way am I looking?’ Answering this question using
  nature alone will take you on a mental adventure. Time and navigation are very closely related, and my other favourite question is: ‘What time is it?’ If you attempt to answer these two
  questions as accurately as possible without using any man-made devices, you will find yourself on a journey, one that takes you from the plants by your feet out into the solar system and beyond.
  The key is to ask yourself those questions. The value lies not in the accuracy of your answers, but in the attempt you make to reach them.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with loose natural time concepts like the well-worn ‘dawn chorus’ of the birds, but birders develop a way of tuning into this clock more
  finely. They note the skylark that stops at dusk and starts at dawn, and the progression of early risers that pre-empt even the more famous alarm call of the cockerel.</p>
<p>Today we may develop natural time-telling skills out of desire, but the roots of it lie in practical necessity. The dairy farmers that get up at five every morning do not do it out of a
  masochistic love of the Shipping Forecast. Their wellingtons tread in the footsteps of ancient, universal traditions. From Rajasthan to Central Africa, pastoral people see time through the rhythms
  of their animals: the Konso of Central Africa describe the period we know as 5–6 p.m. as kakalseema – ‘when the cattle return home’. But what are the cattle tuned
  into? It is not the atomic clock in Teddington, which counts 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a caesium atom before declaring a second to have passed. The Konso and the cattle’s clock is the
  sun.</p>
<p>Every clock, watch, calendar and diary ever invented by humans does a simple job imperfectly. They each track the earth’s daily revolution and its orbit around the sun. They are all wrong
  most of the time. Midday on a watch is rarely midday. Midday is the middle of the day, the moment that the sun is highest in the sky, not twelve o’clock on a watch. Timepieces can track time
  and some do a better job than others, but they don’t create, define or discover it. Dava Sobel put it well: ‘A clock or watch may keep time, but only a sundial can find
  time.’</p>
<p>A watch that disagrees strongly with the sun becomes worthless. The most powerful people on earth will look like fools if they declare it morning before the sun has given permission. For time to
  have any objective meaning, we must look to the sky. Time is measured by our relationship with the sky, but the word ‘our’ is important. It is not just how we relate to the sky as
  individuals or even as a species: in this instance, ‘our’ refers to all living things. Animals each follow their own daily rhythm, and plants such as Arctic poppies, snow buttercups and
  many others turn to face towards the sun over the course of each day.</p>
<p>The stars, animals, flowers and sun beat out time with varying degrees of meticulousness. There are also many time clues that are less exact. In many mountainous tropical parts of the world,
  moist maritime air reaches the hills at midday every day, obscuring the summits in cloud. Or is it ten to twelve? Domestic flights in Sarawak, Borneo are scheduled in the mornings to beat the
  dependable afternoon fogs. Fog-, flower- and star-clocks tick around the world.</p>
<p>Even a nature neophyte will be able to tell summer from winter, by assessing the temperature and looking at tree leaves. A nature enthusiast will be able to tell which month it is by observing
  the birds or the flowers. And a nature zealot may be able to tell the time of day from the opening and closing of a daisy (so named because its petals open and close at dawn and dusk, forming a
  ‘day’s eye’). But the most important thing, however deep your commitment, is to try to make a true connection with nature. A sensitivity to the way we can read time in nature
  leads to an understanding that no two moments are ever repeated. We never see, smell, hear, feel or taste the same thing in exactly the same way twice. This is true in any context, but the
  importance of it is overlooked by most people outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of us would appreciate that a journey on the Indian Pacific Railway or to see Persepolis would represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Far fewer recognize that the sight of, for
  example, a crow flying over a field will never be repeated exactly. There are too many variables. Even if the same crow flew in exactly the same way, the sky, light, colours, plants, scents,
  temperature and sounds we experienced would all be different. Each time we notice anything outdoors it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We have truly learned to read time when we have discovered
  that nature itself allows us to distinguish each moment from those that come before and after it.</p>
<p>Before Charles I was executed in 1649, his parting gift to his son was the silver sundial he carried with him. For the king, a lump of silver this size was not a significant part of his estate,
  but the message he meant to pass with it might have been.</p>
