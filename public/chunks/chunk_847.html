        <h3>(iii) Tenderness</h3>
<p>Love has a third important – but not always easily recognised – ingredient: tenderness. Tenderness often gets overlooked because what it really involves is compassion at a very particular moment: the moment when compassion isn’t obviously deserved. Relationships succeed when it is a partner’s less edifying and unworthy behaviours that remain capable of arousing, alongside a deep sigh, doses of unearned redemptive empathy.</p>
<p>Why we’re not tender</p>
<p>In theory, we all have plenty of time for compassion, but we tend to have some specific notions of where and when this quality should really be deployed. We typically reserve it for the most obviously blameless candidates: those who are sad but entirely good, those who have lost their livelihoods through no fault of their own, those who were born into unfortunate circumstances, struck by lightning or rendered homeless by earthquakes.</p>
<p>What we find it much harder to do is to forgive someone who appears to be behaving suboptimally on purpose, who seems to have made an active choice to mess things up, who looks as if they have taken a negative path out of wilfulness, idiocy or nastiness; someone who had options to be successful or respectable, calm or grown up, but instead – for reasons we have no energy to investigate – decided to shout, to be mean, to respond ungratefully or to display immaturity. We know we are kind people, but we surely cannot be expected to love where love is undeserved.</p>
<p>The true nature of love</p>
<p>And yet that is exactly where love should and must be deployed if relationships are to survive. True love cannot be directed solely towards those who are admirable and virtuous. It has to soften our judgements in relation to people who are at points undeniably maddening and plainly wrong.</p>
<p>A way to conceive of love is as a willingness to look beyond the obvious damning grounds for bad behaviour in search of certain deeper, more forgivable reasons why someone messed up. We see this most clearly in the way that a parent loves a child. When a 3-year-old throws a tantrum and pushes their dinner plate on the floor, scattering pasta everywhere, a parent knows not to slap their offspring and declare them ‘evil’. The parent will search for reasons why their child acted as they did. Perhaps they have sore gums. Maybe they are extremely tired. Perhaps their rivalrous feelings towards a sibling have reached a pitch. The parent searches for something other than sheer ‘badness’ to explain a departure from good sense and decorum.</p>
<p>A little of this curiosity and empathy should, with caveats and boundaries, enter our adult relationships as well. Here, too, there will be plenty of occasions when we cannot easily imagine why our partner acted as they did: their moodiness seems to have no rationale. There can be no blameless explanation for the way they spoke to our friend. Nothing seems capable of excusing their persistent lateness …</p>
<p>But though outrage may feel liberating, it is no friend of love. In order to stand any chance of working, a relationship has to involve – on both sides – a continuous attempt to drill beneath difficult words and actions in search of their more complicated and occasionally touching origins. Perhaps our partner is feeling sexually insecure; maybe they are unduly threatened by a friend’s financial success because they were never allowed to believe that they could matter in themselves. It’s possible that persistent lateness is a protest against a bullying, coercive, time-obsessed parent … Someone may often be a pain and yet still be worthy of a lot of thought and kindness.</p>
<p>Why true tenderness targets the undeserving</p>
<p>At the core of the tender person’s outlook is a simple-sounding but love-sustaining move: they treat the other as no less fragile, flawed and sensitive than they remember themselves to be – only around slightly different things. Tenderness taps modestly and perceptively into self-knowledge.</p>
<p>When love is tender, two partners can together develop an impetus for change: the most easily bruised parts of who they are can dare to be exposed because they know that the other’s touch will be gentle. The things we despaired that no one could understand about us become, at last, possible to admit to. The strange, sweet aspects of our complicated, troubled minds open up to being explored and accepted in all their lonely oddity and shame.</p>
