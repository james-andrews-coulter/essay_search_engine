        <h2>THIS FEELS LIKE AN INSULT</h2>
<p>Modern psychotherapy is united on one point: Our problems require us to engage with our childhoods. This can feel profoundly offensive. How insulting to be told that childhood could matter inordinately to our adult lives, to our temperament, our chances of happiness, our sexuality, our levels of anxiety, and our self-esteem. Particularly if our childhood was difficult, we want more than anything to escape its dark centrifugal energy and to imagine ourselves as a free agent, able to determine the future without impediment. How dispiriting to be asked to believe that who we are was substantially determined by external factors before we reached the age of reason and, moreover, that if we are to have any hope of helping ourselves, we must undertake a painful and lengthy journey to understand the past in fine-grained detail.</p>
<p>It’s clear why we might want to take out our annoyance on psychotherapy itself. Has this discipline not seen how broad and interesting the world is? How many grand and strange things there are in it? Hasn’t it soared over the Western Australian desert or wandered the stately corridors of palaces and national libraries? Why does it so badly want us to return to, and circle, the messy claustrophobic start?</p>
<p>We understand. To take on the past, we don’t need to be driven by a preternatural enthusiasm for self-exploration, we don’t need to be self-pitying or dementedly furious with parents who were only trying to do their best. All that is required is a weary, dutiful realization that the principal way to overcome our history is to address it. We should try to remember not out of nostalgia, but in order to be able to forget, once and for all.</p>
<p>COULD IT MATTER SO MUCH?</p>
<p>Our unwillingness to look backward might have to do with more than just boredom or frustration; it might be a symptom of sheer incredulity that childhood could matter as much as it apparently does. Could this period be so critical? Could events in those short years have such an outsize influence on everything that comes after? Are children really so impressionable and so easily marked?</p>
<p>The short answer to all such enquiries is a weary, regretful but resounding yes. The human mind between the ages of one and ten is dauntingly receptive, infinitely attuned to its environment, which means that our whole identity can be decisively and near-permanently shaped by our young experiences. A somewhat cold, forbidding father or an erratic mother really may be all that is required to breed an elevated degree of anxiety or self-hatred that colors the next eight decades. This susceptibility has been present throughout history, but only now are we beginning to notice it and give it due attention. Every era had its share of childhood-damaged people, it’s just that no one bothered to find out why the fishmonger was so sad, the merchant fell into rages, or the knight was impotent—just as no one bothered to investigate what might pollute water or how germs could spread. We are, finally, becoming a little more aware of causes and effects.</p>
<p>In insisting on the importance of the early years, it can help to think of the acquisition of language. Without having any memory of the phenomenon, all of us learned—between the ages of zero and five—many thousands of words and their seemingly limitless combinations. While we were innocently going about our business—doing cartwheels in the yard, drawing submarines at the kitchen table, eating cookies by the TV—a part of our minds was picking up and assembling, with extraordinary ingenuity, entire dictionaries of terminologies, declensions, verb endings, gerunds, and subordinate clauses. Without having any clue how it all happened, we became expert grammarians, far surpassing our mightiest computers in dexterity.</p>
<p>We should imagine that something similar was going on in the psychological sphere. We were acquiring an extensive command of emotional language: We were learning about trust, communication, esteem, kindness, cruelty, shame, anger, empathy, selfishness, and responsibility. And we didn’t realize that this was happening any more than we realized that we were learning to speak. We were simply going about the ordinary business of childhood while being emotionally imprinted in a most permanent and comprehensive way by the people around us.</p>
<p>We now spare little time thinking of how relative our emotional language might be, just as we seldom reflect on the arbitrariness of speaking English or French rather than Sentinelese or Pirahã. We overlook that there are people for whom love is mohabbat (Hindi) or who bid each other goodnight with hyvää yötä (Finnish) or wǎn’ān (Cantonese). Or, to shift register, people who don’t feel depressed every time they succeed or worry that any sexual encounter might end in shame.</p>
<p>And finally, as with standard language, with time we stand to realize how appallingly hard it can be to learn a new and different language, what a struggle we have ahead of us when we no longer want to speak in our allocated tongue—a tongue of anxiety, self-hatred, contempt, or cynicism—and seek to try to express ourselves instead in tones of trust, calm, and kindness.</p>
