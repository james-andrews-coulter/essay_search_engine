            <h2>NON-JUDGMENT</h2>
<p>Part of what can make the attentions of others oppressive is the note of patronizing pity we may detect beneath their apparent kindness. They—the well ones—have come to see us in order to help, but we sense how much they cling to a fundamental difference between the mess we are in and who they think they are. We are the insane ones and they will always fly the flags of health, rationality, and balance. They feel sorry for us from afar: We are the proverbial drowning man and they the observer on dry land.</p>
<p>Loving companions bear no such hints of superiority. They do not judge us as beneath them when we lie crumpled in our pyjamas at midday because they do not fundamentally see themselves as “above” someone who has fallen through the floor of sanity. We may happen to be very ill at the moment, but it could just as easily have been them if not for the accidents of psychology and of neurochemistry. They don’t oppress us by covertly clinging to a belief in their own inviolable solidity and competence. They throw in little sentences that indicate that they too find life very taxing, that they too are very strange and that they too might one day be in our place.</p>
<p>LOYALTY</p>
<p>At the heart of many mental traumas is an early experience of abandonment. Someone, when we badly needed them, was not present and their neglect has thrown us off balance ever since. We may find it hard to depend on others in adult life and lack faith that someone won’t run away, or take advantage of us, in turn.</p>
<p>A loving companion intuits this about us and is ready to fight to earn our trust. They know that they cannot blithely assert their loyalty, they will have to prove it, which means not deserting us at moments when others would be tempted to give up. We may try to incite despair and frustration in them as a way of testing the relationship; we may say some awful things and pretend to be indifferent. But if the companion is wise, they will listen and remain unruffled—not because they are weak, but because they understand that a basic piece of repair work around trust is under way.</p>
<p>We have to be given the chance, which we may have missed out on in childhood, to be a bit more demanding than usual in order to witness conclusively that this isn’t enough to destroy love. We can be ill and still acceptable to another person. How much more real love will feel once it has been shaken by our disease and survived.</p>
