            <h3>¶ Higher Needs</h3>
<p>What humans require to survive and thrive can roughly, but usefully, be arranged in a hierarchy that runs from lower to higher needs, stretching from the need for food and shelter to the need for self-understanding, meaning and connection.</p>
<p>Business is the foremost instrument through which we attempt to satisfy needs nowadays. But if we analyse economic activity, we find that the overwhelming proportion of it lies clustered around the satisfaction of our lower needs. The large enterprises focus nearly exclusively on catering to such needs as those for transport and nutrition, housing and heating, communication and logistics. Meanwhile, our higher needs lie in a pre-industrial disorganised condition, in the hands of gurus and inspirational teachers, outside the mechanisms and useful disciplines of the market.</p>
<p>This presents a vast economic opportunity for the future. We will in time learn to commercialise all our more complicated needs, which will result in a more honourable and meaningful form of capitalism. Although it might look as if the economy as it stands is well developed, when measured against our real requirements for happiness, we have barely scratched the surface, and an enormous expansion of capitalism is at hand. We plainly need not only food and shelter but, among many other things, to live in beautiful cities; to have good advice and psychological support; to manage our emotions; to sustain strong families across generations; to cultivate our minds; to be wise, kind and self-possessed; and to be the recipients of news and entertainment that are reliably well targeted to our requirements for inner growth and dignity.</p>
<p>Each of these presents immense targets for the businesses of the future to aim for. The fact that these needs don’t look the same as those that led to the construction of highways or pipelines doesn’t make them illegitimate or unviable. It is no corruption of higher needs to ask that commerce begins to address them; rather, it is an attempt to make capitalism as meaningful as it can be.</p>
