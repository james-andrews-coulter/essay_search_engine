            <h3>¶ Art and News</h3>
<p>News organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information – assuming that if the information is significant, it will immediately go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We too often get bored and turn away when the facts, however important they might be, are heaped in front of us in a dry or confrontational way. In order to matter to us, facts have to be shaped so that they can enter our imaginations. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.</p>
<p>A standard response on the part of frustrated news organisations is to blame us, the audience, for not caring enough. The reason we don’t care about important things must be that we’re stupid or selfish. The inclination is then to nag, to make us feel guilty for, and ashamed of, our indifference. This approach might work for a small number of people, but is usually ineffective. We simply stop listening. We just don’t care about yet another victim, refugee or instance of tyranny.</p>
<p>But another, kinder and more realistic, way of thinking about our indifference is to see it as the consequence of a failure of art. There is no such thing as a boring story, only a story told in a boring way. Pretty much any sequence of events could be made compelling in the hands of a talented artist.</p>
<p>An instance of the power of art in relation to the news can be found in a strange historical episode. During the 1820s, the British public became obsessed with the Greek War of Independence, during which Greece broke away from the Ottoman Empire after Britain offered decisive material assistance to the rebels. This was surprising because there was no obvious interest for Britain in the move. The reason for the involvement was more or less entirely due to the impassioned support and advocacy of the most famous writer of the era: the poet Lord Byron. In one poem he wrote:</p>
<p>The mountains look on Marathon –</p>
<p>And Marathon looks on the sea;</p>
<p>And musing there an hour alone,</p>
<p>I dreamed that Greece might still be free.</p>
<p>Byron didn’t pile up statistics or argue a complex political case. He didn’t scold. He painted an emotional picture. The entire educated population of England knew of the ancient battle of Marathon and of the famous run that brought news of victory to Athens. Byron was conveying a sense of the grandeur of the current struggle and making people in Hampshire and Sussex feel that events unfolding in the Peloponnese mattered to them as much as something in their own village. Byron was not above a few salacious and sentimental moves: he wrote of how attractive Greek women were and lamented that, unless the War of Independence was won, ‘such breasts must suckle slaves’.</p>
<p>Art seduces: it can be defined as the skill of making an idea immediately powerful via an appeal to the senses. This isn’t a climbdown; it is a wise recognition of how our minds function. The newsrooms of the Utopia would be largely staffed by artists, so that the most important messages could be made to lodge properly and powerfully in our erratic and distracted minds.</p>
