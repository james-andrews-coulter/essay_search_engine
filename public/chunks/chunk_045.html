        <h2>Astronomy &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>It is a mark of melancholy to be unable to buy into the status system. We melancholics know well enough what we’re meant to care about: careers, money, the opinions of the community, the latest stories in the news, our identities in the eyes of others, where the economy is headed in the next decade. We know the purported significance, but we may also – in a private part of our minds – not care very much at all.</p>
<p>We’re not merely cold or unfeeling. We’ve just ended up prone to seeing our species and our planet from a less human-centric perspective. Our eyes naturally settle not on what is directly in front of us but on how we might appear from 6 billion kilometres away. We’re thinking not of what tomorrow will bring, but of how the present moment might seem in relation to the age of the Earth.</p>
<p>The natural place to take such feelings of disengagement is not – as society sometimes tells us – a psychotherapist’s chair, but rather our planetariums and our departments of astronomy, our charts of the lunar surface and our galleries of images from the Voyager space probes. We may redeem our melancholic intuitions by studying the swirls of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 236,000,000,000,000,000 kilometres from the Sun, or photographs of late afternoon on the Aeolis Palus plain of Mars. Astronomy is the true friend of the melancholy mind; NASA and the European Space Agency are its presiding deities.</p>

<p>Through our immersion in space, our alienated perspectives can be confirmed and returned to us with dignity. We are allowed to anchor our disengagement from the human drama to passing meteorites or the moons of Jupiter. Our loneliness can find a true home on the vast silent dune fields of Sputnik Planitia on the southern hemisphere of Pluto. Some of our sense of loss can be absorbed by the asteroid-pockmarked surface of the Moon. Our insignificance can be framed within the context of the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the observable universe.</p>
<p>Planetariums may seem to be trying to show us the stars in order to equip us with the knowledge we’d require to become astronauts or physicists one day. In truth, they offer us a means by which to diminish ourselves in our own eyes; they are a tool with which to take the sting out of our nagging sense of unimportance and our frustration at our modest achievements and sense of isolation.</p>
<p>There can be good reasons for us to strive to live in the here and now. But there may be yet more powerful reasons to dwell for at least part of the day in the Proterozoic age of the Earth, between 2,500 million and 542 million years ago, when single-celled eukaryotes developed deep in the silence of giant, undisturbed oceans. We don’t need to blame ourselves unduly if we feel at odds with our nagging fellow humans when we can establish imaginary companionship with some of the many wondrous forms in which life has manifested itself across planetary history, like the beguiling-looking Psittacosaurus parrot lizard who lived over 100 million years ago, or the dog-sized, tuft-tailed, two-legged Chaoyangsaurus who roamed the earth around 150 million years ago.</p>
<p>The best consolation for our sadness at how little ever works out is to cheer ourselves with the thought that the average stable lifespan of a star is only 10 billion years and that our Sun has already burnt for just under half of that. Soon enough, this middle-aged star’s increased brightness will cause our oceans to evaporate, then it will run out of hydrogen and become a red giant star, expanding as far as Mars and absorbing the whole of our planet, including the atoms of everyone and everything that is annoying us so much today.</p>
<p>We should drown our tears in the ocean of suffering to which every living thing is subject. We should align our feelings of purposelessness with detailed news of the five mass extinctions to have befallen the planet. To every reversal, we should simply answer that there are 40 billion planetary systems at large in the universe. Before every anxiety-inducing date or speech, we should mutter to ourselves, like a talismanic prayer, that the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across and that the most distant known galaxy is GN-z11, 32 billion light years from the restaurant or conference centre.</p>
<p>The melancholy mind often suspects that everything may be a bit meaningless. Through astronomy, we can discover, in the most engaging and inadvertently life-affirming way possible, why and how it truly is exactly that.</p>
