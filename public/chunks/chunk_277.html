            <h1>4. The Focused-Attention Exercise</h1>
<p>For this exercise I like to take between forty-five minutes and an hour, but you may want to start with five minutes of focusing, and build up in increments. It may help to have someone read this exercise to you while you are doing it, or you can record yourself reading it aloud, and play it back.</p>
<p>Think of this as a work-out for your brain, so do not go to sleep. Sit on a chair with your back straight, your feet on the ground and your eyes open. First, and without changing it, notice how you are breathing … When your mind wanders, and it will, bring it back to your breathing … Notice how your abdomen expands as you breathe in …</p>
<p>Looking down at the ground in front of you, notice what your eyes alight upon; become aware of the colours, textures and shapes you can see … Spend a minute or two looking and noticing without judging what you see … Return your attention to your breathing … Imagine the shape the air makes inside your body … Notice the in-breath … Notice the out-breath …</p>
<p>Notice all the sounds you hear … Notice the sounds outside the room … Notice the sounds in the room … Spend a couple of minutes alternating your attention between all the different sources of sound you can hear … Now return your attention to your breathing … Notice the sensation of your out-breath as the air leaves your nostrils … Notice the different sensation of the air coming into your nostrils on your in-breath … Be aware of any taste in your mouth and smells in the room … on your in-breath, pay attention to smell … and on your out-breath pay attention to taste … Where on your tongue is the sensation of taste happening? … At what point in your cycle of breath is your sense of smell heightened? …</p>
<p>Come back to your breathing again … Imagine the clean air travelling through your body to your feet … Be aware of what the soles of your feet feel like … What does the skin on your feet feel right now? … Where is most pressure felt on the feet? … Then pay attention to what the skin feels on your right hand … What, if anything, is it touching? … Now turn your attention to your left hand … Think about the external temperature your hands can sense … Return to your breath … If your eyes are not closed close them now, as you notice how you are breathing …</p>
<p>Turn your attention to your digestive system … Move your awareness slowly through your mouth … oesophagus … stomach … intestines … bowel … bladder … rectum … Come back to your breathing, notice your in-breath … then your out-breath … Notice the turn at the top of the breath … How long do you take after breathing in before the out-breath starts? … Be aware of that pause … Be aware of the pause at the bottom of the breath … Now take your awareness to your heart … notice your pulse … stay there for a while, focusing on your heartbeat … Return to noticing your breathing and pause there for a minute …</p>
<p>Focus on the chatter in your head; spend a while observing the thoughts you are having … Come back to your breathing … Now imagine yourself being able to breathe underwater, like a fish … Imagine yourself deep in the ocean, looking up to the surface of the water … That surface is your mood … Is it stormy? … Smooth? … Now you are a bird flying high above the water … With the power of your thought you can make the water rough or smooth … Return your attention to your breathing …</p>
<p>Now turn your inner focus to the person who is closest to you at the moment … How do you relate to that person? … How do you feel when you think of them? … Broaden the net to those you have spoken to today … Do you feel connected or disconnected to them? … How do you feel connected or disconnected to your closest family and friends? … To your community? … Your country? … Your world? …</p>
<p>Come back to your breathing once more, be aware of the rise and fall of your breath. Remember what you have just done; you have explored your five most immediate senses: sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. You have explored inner, physical sensations and you have noticed your thoughts and your feelings. You have visualized your feelings as the surface of the ocean while you have observed them; you have felt your sense of connectedness with others, and now you return to your breathing once more …</p>
<p>As you notice your breathing, notice yourself noticing your breathing … Notice that you can focus your attention purposefully to any of these areas … You are not at the mercy of your thoughts, you can direct them … You can deliberately notice something … or you can deliberately or absentmindedly notice your attention wandering …</p>
<p>Write or draw what it was like for you to do this exercise. What is in the foreground for you now, as you remember doing it?</p>
