            <h3>¶ Culture Can Replace Scripture</h3>
<p>When religion began to go into decline in northwestern Europe in the second half of the 19th century, many thoughtful people wondered what would fill the enormous gap it left behind. Where would we derive the consolation and community that religions had once so persuasively offered? How would we learn forgiveness? How could gratitude be instilled? Where would awe come from?</p>
<p>One penetrating answer came from an influential group of intellectuals in France, England and Germany who proposed that there was a highly serviceable, ready-made replacement for Scripture to hand; something that could have all the profundity, utility and emotional reach of the old canon: Culture.</p>
<p>‘Culture can replace Scripture’ became the new rallying cry of secularising societies. In the novels of Jane Austen and Tolstoy, in the paintings of Chardin and Delacroix, in the music of Schubert and Chopin, it was alleged, there could be just the right material to make up for what humanity was losing through the decline of faith.</p>
<p>It was on this basis that a large number of cultural projects were undertaken with public money: enormous libraries were built, museums were put up that looked like temples (‘Museums will be our new cathedrals’, was the rallying cry) and humanities departments were started in almost all national universities. Some of what we had once found in a Bible we were now to find in the best novels and epic poems.</p>
<p>The Reading Room of the British Library in London (now part of the British Museum) was built at huge government expense in the 1850s. Not coincidentally, the vast dome was precisely designed to be three feet wider than that of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome – for centuries the largest and most famous church in the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, opened in 1885, was designed by the foremost Dutch architect of churches, Pierre Cuypers, and looked (on purpose) almost exactly like a cathedral.</p>
<p>The idea that Culture might replace Scripture is a beautiful and highly valid one. But it is also an idea that, despite the hopes of its earliest proponents, has failed entirely. If one showed up at any museum in the world looking for redemption, solace and friendship (as one might in a religious building), one would become an instant object of suspicion. If one enrolled on a philosophy degree in any university with a view to learning ‘how to live and die well’ (as the temples once taught one to do), one would be quickly disappointed by the curriculum on offer and probably ejected from the course at an early juncture.</p>

<p>The architecture of this room deliberately recalls the awe-inspiring and noble spaces of the grandest churches.</p>

<p>Culture truly can deliver wisdom and emotional education, but the guardians of Culture – those who presently control the cultural machine, with its broadcasters, museums and universities – have no interest in honouring this potential. They care instead about the preservation of texts, the display of works, the cataloguing of dates, the analysis of linguistic tropes, and a range of comparable academic pieties. Wisdom, explicit guidance and emotional education are not on the agenda. In the real world, Culture has not replaced Scripture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the emotional needs of a secular society remain as intense and as unattended as ever. We have been left to our own devices, without the support of the great public institutions that were originally intended to assist us. The promise of the domed reading rooms and cathedral-like museums remains to be adequately discovered and judiciously exploited.</p>
