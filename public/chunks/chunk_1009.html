        <h2>I. THE INTERMINABLE ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>One of the hardest types of argument to unpick is the type that looks, from a distance, as though it is always new and always unique. One day the argument is about something one person said to a friend, the next it is about a family reunion; sometimes the argument centres around a stain that’s appeared on the sofa, at another point it’s around the government’s approach to the setting of interest rates.</p>
<p>What is surprising to imagine is that we may, unwittingly, be having the same argument in disguise. The flashpoints of agitation may superficially seem very diverse, but they are all reconfigurations of the same basic conflictual material.</p>
<p>Arguments about whether to take the train or the bus, or about taking out the bins, or about the economic potential of Africa, or about a scratch on a wooden table, or about whether it’s OK to be five minutes late for a dental appointment, or about what to give a friend as a wedding present, or about the difference between a serviette and a napkin may all be emerging from the repeated, frustrated attempt to transmit a single intimate truth: I feel you don’t respect my intelligence.</p>
<p>We keep arguing because we never manage to identify and address the key issue we’re actually cross about; irritability is anger that lacks self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Why should it be so hard to trace the origins of our rage? At points, it’s because what offends us is so humiliating in structure. It can be shameful for us to realise that the person in whom we have invested so much may not in fact desire us physically, or might not fundamentally be kind, or could be exploiting us financially or gravely impeding our professional aspirations. We come under immense internal pressure not to square up to truths that would require us to make a range of practically difficult and emotionally devastating realisations. We prefer to let our anger seep out in a myriad of minor conflicts over seemingly not very much rather than have to argue over the direction of our lives.</p>
<p>We may, furthermore, not have grown up with a sense that our dissatisfactions ever deserve expression. Our parents might have been too anxious, too vulnerable or too bullying to allow much room for our early needs. We might have become masters in the art of not complaining and of accepting what we are given as the price of survival and of the protection of those we love. But this doesn’t now spare us feelings of frustration; it simply makes us incapable of giving them a voice.</p>
<p>We are hence doomed to keep having small or diversionary squabbles so as not to have to touch the fundamental truth at the core of our complaints: You don’t show me enough physical affection; My life is harder than your life; Your family are much worse than you think they are; I’m threatened by your friends; You have the wrong approach to money.</p>
<p>But, naturally, in the course of not having the big discussion, we poison everything else. No day is free of the marks of the conflict that has not been had.</p>
<p>We should learn to have the courage of our frustrations, and of our fears. It is always better to touch the ur-argument than for a relationship to die by a thousand squabbles. We will cease to fight so much when we can face up to, and voice, what we’re really furious about.</p>
