        <h2>On Not Thinking Straight</h2>
<p>It would be reassuring to believe that our degree of intelligence is relatively impervious to our emotional state; that, broadly speaking, we remain as clever as we ever are whatever happens to be unfolding for us emotionally. Of course, in certain very dramatic moments, it’s expected that our cleverness might take a hit: it would be hard to do quadratic equations accurately if there was a tiger in the room. But on the whole, surely one or two waves of emotional disturbance shouldn’t knock out a faculty as central and as long-established as intelligence …</p>
<p>This, however, is to underestimate the extent to which – awkwardly – our powers of reason are apt to fail us entirely under particular conditions. By all objective measures we may display every sign of high intelligence: we may have an excellent grasp of history and politics, science and art. We may be capable of running a sizeable team or managing a high-profile career. And yet, faced with certain challenges, we are wont to relapse into the reasoning patterns of the very young and very unqualified child we once were.</p>
<p>It appears by the way our minds are built, that no age that we have ever travelled through is ever entirely superseded and rendered inaccessible to us. Like a Russian doll, beneath an adult shell we contain all our past selves, to which we will be sent back according to outer circumstances. A person who was bullied by an overbearing parent as a 5-year-old may, since then, have acquired two PhDs, gained membership in an elite intellectual circle and have raised a family. And yet when this unfortunate soul comes up against a bullying older adversary, they may have no capacity whatsoever to approach them as an adult with a right to live – let alone a deep understanding of Roman law, the novels of George Eliot and the workings of semiconductors. Instead, they meet this parental figure once again as a shy and defenceless child, worried that they are going to be hit or annihilated, and as a result, they struggle to form coherent sentences or remember their own name. We are apt to return to precisely the degree of intelligence that we possessed when certain difficulties arose in childhood and seared themselves across our neuronal pathways. Trauma keeps us as cognitively limited as we were when a given disaster struck us.</p>
<p>The way in which our intelligence is hampered by our emotions means that we misread reality without noticing our blindness. For example, we might be unable to recognise that someone is treating us unfairly in an intimate relationship and that we would have every right to make a complaint, because we grew up to expect this kind of treatment and to not question it. Our sizeable intelligence walks right past an issue that would immediately attract the attention of any moderately interested outsider.</p>
<p>Or we may be unable to consider the extent of our freedom and our options to leave a job or start a new life, because our intelligence has been silenced by an emotional expectation that suffering and resignation are our dues. We may also find it impossible to see that we are falling into depression because a chance to be angry was never granted to us, or that we are developing a paranoia as an alternative to directing anger back at an adversary, or that we are impelled to crash our career because of an impression of unworthiness.</p>
<p>Fear isn’t only unpleasant – it makes us ‘stupid’. Yet, devilishly, it does so in ways that we can’t easily observe. Our reasoning faculties switch off, but without granting us even a hint that they are doing so. We don’t sense our panic; we don’t feel our intellectual wattage being dialled down to close to zero. We have no subjective awareness of when our adult brains are quietly unplugged and surreptitiously replaced by those of naïve and terrified infants.</p>
<p>Even if we cannot grasp that we are not thinking straight – and perhaps because of that fact – we should allow for the overall possibility of the phenomenon and make the necessary adjustments. We should forgive our traumatised minds for not being able to yield an accurate picture of the world, its threats and its options, and treat them with good humour. We shouldn’t feel insulted that, without warning, we will at times be as cognitively limited as a worried, shamed and naïve 4-year-old. In turn, when we find ourselves in emotional zones that we identify as dangerous, we should take care to have a few other adequately sized brains around us into which, like a machine with a depleted battery, we can plug ourselves – so as to recalibrate our assessment of the choices in front of us.</p>
<p>At moments when we are convinced that failure is staring us in the face, when we are sure that bankruptcy, abandonment, exile or disgrace is about to strike, we should do ourselves the favour of imagining that we are, perhaps, not in any danger at all; rather we have stopped being able to think straight. We have done so not because we are inherently stupid (it would be easier if we were), but because while we are extremely intelligent, at this instant – due to an invisible and regrettable connection between our present-day challenge and one in the past that we had to face without adequate love or care – we have regressed to an earlier state of cognitive ability and most of our brain is not available for use.</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to take our fears as facts, we should good-naturedly accept that our minds are simply prone to faulty readings; that there almost certainly is no tiger in the room, no monster about to swallow us and no catastrophe about to destroy everything. There is simply an adult mind that, for very good and very sad reasons, has completely stopped working for a while – and needs some help.</p>
