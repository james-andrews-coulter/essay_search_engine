            <h3>¶ Meaning of Life, The</h3>
<p>A meaningful life is close to, but at points importantly different from, a happy life. A meaningful life draws upon, and exercises, a range of our higher capacities: those bound up with tenderness, care, connection, self-understanding, sympathy, intelligence and creativity.</p>
<p>A meaningful life aims not so much at day-to-day contentment as fulfilment. We may be leading a meaningful life and yet often be in a bad mood – just as we may be having frequent surface fun while living, for the most part, meaninglessly.</p>
<p>A meaningful life is bound up with the long term. Projects, relationships, interests and commitments will build up cumulatively. Meaningful activities leave something behind, even when the emotions that once propelled us into them have passed.</p>
<p>Meaningful activities aren’t necessarily those we do most often. They are those we value most highly and will, from the perspective of our deaths, regret most deeply.</p>
<p>The question of what makes life meaningful has to be answered personally, even if our conclusions are marked by no particular idiosyncrasy. Others cannot be relied upon to determine what will be meaningful to us. What we call ‘crises of meaning’ are generally moments when someone else’s – perhaps well-intentioned – interpretation of what might be meaningful to us runs up against a growing realisation of our divergent tastes and interests.</p>
<p>By a process of experience and introspection, we have to work out what counts as meaningful in our eyes. Whereas pleasure manifests itself immediately, our taste in meaning may be more elusive. We can be relatively far into our lives before we securely identify what lends them their meaning.</p>
<p>That said, The School of Life considers that meaningful lives are generally anchored around eight themes: love, family, work, friendship, culture, politics, nature and philosophy. Most are well known; the point isn’t to identify entirely new sources of meaning so much as to try to evoke and explain some familiar choices.</p>
<p>To wonder too openly, or intensely, about the Meaning of Life sounds like a peculiar, ill-fated and unintentionally comedic pastime. It isn’t anything an ordinary mortal should be doing – or would get very far by doing. Without always acknowledging it, we are operating with a remarkably ungenerous perspective on the Meaning of Life.</p>
<p>Yet the subject is for everyone; it is for all of us to wonder about, and define, a meaningful existence. There need be nothing forbidding about the issue. A meaningful life can be simple in structure, personal, usable, attractive and familiar. It is time to turn the pursuit of a meaningful life from a comedically complex impossibility to something we can all comprehend, aim for and succeed at.</p>
