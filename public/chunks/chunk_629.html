        <h2>CHEERFULNESS</h2>
<p>Past ages understood the need to leave a wide space for sadness and melancholy in the experience of every human being. Life was understood to be, for the most part, a matter of regret, longing, failure, incompleteness, and sadness. Buddhism declared that life itself was suffering; the Judaeo-Christian tradition emphasized that we were all the heirs of Adam and Eve, broken and tarred by sin, condemned to grief outside the gates of paradise. The situation was dark but, crucially, communally so. There was no danger of feeling isolated with one’s woes; to exist was automatically to sign up to suffering.</p>
<p>Modernity has heroically thrown off such inbuilt pessimism. It is an age of resolute good cheer, of faith in the future and in our ability to overcome whatever challenges we face through willpower and technology. Pessimism has been recategorized as a disease.</p>
<p>But though the trajectory of humankind may, arguably, be on an upward curve, the arc of every life never manages to escape fearsome degrees of pain and loss. The human race may be getting happier, but each one of us remains exposed to a devastating range of sorrows. Except that there is now an added burden in weeping when we are meant to smile and in wanting to hide when others are insisting that we step out and celebrate. Our sadness starts to seem like a personal curse rather than what it more fairly always is: an inevitable feature of being alive.</p>
