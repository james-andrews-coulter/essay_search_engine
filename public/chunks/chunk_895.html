        <h3>The Standard Model doesn’t acknowledge trade-offs</h3>
<p>The Standard Model insinuates a particular image of closeness. But it leaves a great many elements out and doesn’t square up to trade-offs. It doesn’t acknowledge that two people might well get on better if they sometimes had time apart. It doesn’t allow that getting very involved with a partner’s family might be a major emotional burden that undermines goodwill elsewhere, or even simply that sharing a bed might lead to disrupted sleep patterns and consequent grumpiness. In particular, it fails to come clean about the vast costs to a relationship of having children. The immense emotional investment in raising a family almost always – in time – radically diminishes the pleasure that two people can take in each other’s company. One can have intimacy or children, but rarely both – at least for many years.</p>
<p>The Standard Model invites us to clarify our priorities. With its example in mind, we can ask: are we more focused on having a love relationship with our partner, or is having a family the main thing for us? Does sex matter, or is an absence of every jealous feeling a bigger priority? We have for too long suffered because we have not dared to look at the trade-offs that exist, and yet we were making them anyway given that perfection and holistic joy have never been on the cards. We would significantly help ourselves if we could at least consciously understand what we were sacrificing and in the name of what advantage.</p>
<p>It would make a great difference if, in practice, we could sit down very early on with a partner with whom things were starting to go well and try to define for ourselves as individuals and together as a couple what we actually want from a union. What are we hoping and trying to do together? It’s a challenging and essential question that the Standard Model unfairly renders illegitimate. Naively, it can seem as if the only possible answer for a decent and kind person would be: ‘We should do everything together.’</p>
<p>Yet a truly accurate (and therefore properly loving) answer would have to be more flavoured. We can imagine what some honest responses from different people might look like if they had bravely explored their minds and constructed authentic lives for themselves as a result:</p>
<p>In our relationship, we see each other for dinner twice a week, we have some shared finances and we go on one big holiday together each year. We’ve never had sex with each other.</p>
<p>We both need a lot of personal space, so although we live in the same flat, we’ve got pretty strictly demarcated areas. I‘d never go into my partner’s room unless they specifically asked me in. When we have sex it’s usually on the sofa bed in the sitting room. We each make a contribution to shared expenses, but other than that our finances are completely separate. We always take our holidays separately.</p>
<p>We have two children and collaborate very deeply and lovingly around caring for and educating them, but we only live together at weekends.</p>
<p>We share a home and a bed, we’re sexually faithful to one another, but apart from that our lives are rather separate. We have very different friendship groups and interests; we rarely spend an evening together, but it means a lot to be back home at eleven for a kiss and a glass of wine.</p>
<p>We are in constant contact, we see each other every day, we are devoted to each other sexually, but we’ve discovered we simply cannot share a house; we’d drive each other mad.</p>
<p>To familiarise ourselves with the range of good living arrangements that couples have discovered is to liberate ourselves from the oppressive power of the Standard Model: this may be perfect for some people but evidently equally crushing for a great many others. This entails a thrilling, slightly terrifying realisation: there is in reality no particular reason why we have to do things a certain way. It’s up to us to create for ourselves and our partner a vision of coupledom that – however eccentric it might seem at first glance – allows us to do very well the one thing we all really want: to be happy together.</p>
