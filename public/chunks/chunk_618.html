        <h2>TRUE NORMALITY</h2>
<p>Part of the reason why we may have fallen ill is because of the scale of the lies we have had to tell the world about ourselves—not in order to deceive, more in order not to shock or offend. Our illness masks a truth that is struggling to break through a compliant exterior. There is so much that we are meant to be but are not and are meant to feel but don’t. And in the gap between our notion of respectability and our own reality, there grow silence, shame, anxiety, and guilt.</p>
<p>We may—in private—be terrified of being exposed as incompetent at work, while having to maintain an aura of poise in front of colleagues. Or we may be hugely frustrated with a partner or a parent while under pressure to show only consideration and calm. Or there may be a secret in our sex lives that seems wholly incompatible with what we hear discussed in the media or among our friends.</p>
<p>Therapy should at last allow us to be honest. We can finally tell someone else the secrets that have pained us for too long. We can tell a non-judgmental, judicious, wise observer about the appalling terrors that we have been assailed by and the incongruous thoughts that run through our minds. We don’t need to be afraid of upsetting or surprising the therapist; they have seen all this before and much more. We can tell them about the crying in the night, the longing to be dead, the anxiety that strikes every morning, the fear of failure, the nature of our sexual tastes. We don’t have to be cheerful, competent, restrained, or admirable. We can be ourselves, in all our complexity and strangeness. We can regress, complain, and lament, without fear of censorship and condemnation. We can start to heal ourselves through honesty.</p>
