        <h3>Clouds, streams, trees</h3>
<p>To lay claim to the steadiness and objectivity we need, we would be well advised to spend as much time as possible contemplating phenomena wholly disconnected from our immediate concerns. We should be sure to take a lot of walks outside.</p>
<p>On the way, we should look up. Clouds, thankfully, know nothing of us – they float by utterly unaware of our concerns. We can be reminded that everything will pass, even the current nastiness and anxiety, just as the clouds that seemed so fixed and heavy but an hour ago have now moved on, leaving behind only two or three of their number, apologetic and timid before the victorious sun.</p>
<p>We should look at trees, those role models of patience and resolution. Their gnarled, worn barks speak of the hundreds of seasons they have endured. They have bent and lost branches in winter winds, they have been gnawed at by worms and beetles across the airless days of summer, they have been knocked and hacked at by farmers and children. But they endure – as we might better learn to do through their example.</p>
<p>We should contemplate streams. Their constant activity enlivens the imagination. They don’t stare blankly back at us, like pieces of paper on a desk. They distract our minds just enough that the good ideas – the ones that we are hesitant to ask ourselves directly – can feel relieved of pressure and slip out.</p>
<p>We need nature not just for physical health, but, just as importantly, for relief from the tensions of our psyches. No day should be counted as wise if it does not include at least a few moments given over to clouds, trees or streams: robust emissaries of perspective, patience and introspection.</p>
