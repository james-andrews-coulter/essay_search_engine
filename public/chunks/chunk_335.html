            <h2>16 Perfectionism</h2>
<p>Part of our problem as a species is that we are troublingly good at making things perfect. We can set our minds on an extraordinary goal and — with heroic sacrifice, thousands of hours of effort, many wrong turns and periods of intense despair — reach the target. We can pull off a masterwork, we can exceed all normal expectations, we can triumph and awe — and advance humankind.</p>
<p>In many fields, it appears we’re getting ever better at reaching perfection. What we call the modern age has witnessed an unparalleled increase in the number and scale of our achievements, from technology to cookery, hostelry to sport, fashion to medicine.</p>
<p>To begin a list of these, in aviation, we launched the perfect passenger plane, the Airbus A350 in 2013; in football, Brazil’s Carlos Alberto kicked the perfect goal into the Italian net in the 1970 World Cup final; in engineering, Michel Virlogeux designed the perfect bridge to span the Tarn valley in southern France in 2004; Coco Chanel introduced the perfect black dress in 1926; Jonas Salk and his team at the University of Pittsburgh designed the perfect vaccine for polio in 1952; Dieter Rams designed the perfect radio, the RT20 Tabletop, for Braun in 1963; the Swiss graphic designer Adrian Frutiger designed the perfect font — Univers — in 1957; the baker Pierre Hermé designed the perfect pastry in 2005, the 2000 Feuilles Praliné, made of piedmont hazelnut and thin layers of Brittany crêpe dentelle; in 1989, Intel released the perfect microprocessor, the 80486; W.H. Auden wrote the perfect poem, ‘Musée de Beaux Arts,’ in 1938; Rutherford made the perfect analysis in physics with his model of the atom in 1911; Aman opened the perfect hotel, the Aman Giri, in Utah in 2009; Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel of Genesis wrote the perfect song, ‘Firth of Fifth,’ in 1973; Eric Rohmer made the perfect film, The Green Ray, in 1986; and Stephen Shore took the perfect photograph at the Causeway Inn, Tampa, Florida in 1977.</p>

<p>It is of little use telling a species like ours that aiming hard for perfection might be impossible or inadvisable; that perfectionism, the grasping and aching for the transcendent and the flawless, might be a foolish quest — as the final chords of Bach’s Dona Nobis Pacem echo around King’s College Chapel or the cargo doors of the Space Shuttle Atlantis open to release the Galileo spacecraft, on its way to map the moons of Jupiter. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to insist: the quest for perfection — uncritically held up as a collective goal by the modern age — carries grave dangers. We may all have perfect moments, we may all pull off perfect feats, but no one who has ever walked the Earth can ever have a perfect life.</p>
<p>And yet we keep being surprised by the point. At the more sublime end of the spectrum, we read biographies of great artists and scientists, chefs and engineers, and profess to be surprised when we hear of ugly divorces and selfish friendships, distasteful politics and poor parenting. We somehow keep expecting that a human can be as perfect as what they create; we don’t seem to understand that the reason why perfect objects and achievements have such a hold on us is precisely because we are, as a race, and as individuals, inherently imperfect. We would not be so moved by the music of Bach or the poetry of Baudelaire if this level of perfection were our usual home.</p>
<p>Our tears tell us a crucial fact: both that perfection is what we aspire to and also that it is something we only ever have a tenuous hold on. We cannot dwell on the icy brilliant peaks — we might ascend to them at rare moments, but our real dwelling place is in the marshy lowlands and the murky forests. We have feet of clay and, only very rarely, damaged angels’ wings.</p>
<p>It’s this duality that the modern age has left us so confused about. It has generalised outwards from humanity’s most heroic feats. It has tried to democratise genius and inspiration, talent and goodness, leaving us to imagine that human life itself might be a perfectible phenomenon, merely awaiting a few more discoveries and technical innovations before every crease has been ironed out and the pathway to a brightly lit, immortal zone is laid down.</p>
<p>It sounds kind, but the effect may be catastrophic, for we suffer dearly at an individual level from our collective dreams. How insufficient and humiliated we feel in a perfectionist world to be only ever that most modest of creatures: us — with all our flaws, compulsions, errors and absurdities, that can strike as unforgivable as we survey them in the restless hours of another damnable night. What we need are reminders that being the way we are was always the only possibility; that to stumble and miss, to regret and to understand too late are inherent features of the patchily evolved and largely foolhardy animals that we are.</p>
<p>Other eras, more primitive than our own in their technologies and less graced with achievements of perfection, understood the point better than we do. The ancient Greeks created the artistic genre we know today as ‘tragedy’ to remind themselves that the highest humans, the greatest warriors and statesmen, poets and orators, were in the end all profoundly flawed — and never more than when they failed to accept that they might be so. The blood-soaked stories of tragedy that unfolded on stages across the Peloponnese told of errors of judgement, blind spots, excessive tempers and stubborn sides of character that unwound the lives of able and admirable people. The moral was clear: no one escapes the general law of humanity, that we cannot get through this life without significant lapse and misdeed, that we are innately inadequate and damaged. True wisdom begins the moment we fully take this on board about ourselves and others; from that position can spring self-forgiveness, pity and compassion.</p>
<p>Eugene Delacroix, Medea, 1838.</p>
<p>The message from the Judeo-Christian tradition was just as solemn and cautionary. No human can ever be perfect and that to imagine that such a thing were possible is to offend the very laws of the universe. There is only one perfect being, and our brief high points are only ever the result of his grace. For the theologian Saint Augustine, writing in the dying days of the once proud Roman Empire, every human is marked by the taint of ‘original sin’. The phrase is dated, peculiar but enormously useful. The transgressions of Adam and Eve mean that all their descendants, not just this or that unlucky one but all of us, cannot expect to lead perfect lives. We are sinners casting around for redemption.</p>
<p>The Buddhists, thousands of miles away, though at a similar time, made an identical point. For them, too, life was a conclusively imperfect journey, marked by suffering, riddled with delusion and fallacy. To remind themselves of this, Zen in Japan initiated an artistic tradition that identified the distinctive beauty in imperfect things: lopsided pots still marked by the craftsman’s hands, roof tiles stained with rain, garden paths overgrown with moss, rainy days in which the pine trees appear only fleetingly through bands of mist.</p>
<p>To sense the gap between the more perfectionist sensibility of the West and the more modest attitudes of the Zen Buddhist potters, we need only compare an ideally symmetrical soup tureen from the royal Sèvres Porcelain workshop with a tea bowl from Japan in the same period. The soup tureen is quietly certain that life is a perfectible journey; as we ladle our vegetable consommé, it delivers a sermon on ideals of balance and harmony; but in Japan, as we raise an endearingly misshapen cup of green tea to our lips, we’re hearing a perhaps yet more valuable lesson about the need for a gracious accommodation with our unruly and fractured selves. We may have made some perfect things; but we should never expect of ourselves what we would expect from an object, let alone a scientific formula, a rocket or a song. We should not judge ourselves by the standards of our finest creations.</p>

<p>To counter the temper of modernity, a philosophy of imperfectionism should be applied across our lives. In relationships, it could become the bedrock of tolerance and good humour. A person who announced themselves on an early date as a creature of near perfection — and improving every day — would raise alarm bells: they will swiftly prove insufferable and always remain hard to know. A sense of another’s reality emerges when we can admit to our mutual vulnerability and fear.</p>
<p>What we seek in love is not so much a perfect being as someone who can warn us of their multiple flaws with insight, in good time, so that we might strive to adapt and accommodate — as they would for us. On the receiving end of love, we crave not so much for someone to be awed by us as for them to see our failings clearly and yet to treat us with generosity and warmth.</p>
<p>Jan Gossaert, An Elderly Couple, c. 1520.</p>
<p>At work, a philosophy of imperfectionism might prepare us for how long anything halfway decent will take to produce. We cannot expect the novel, business plan, painting or power station to be right immediately; we should budget for frustration and therefore be readier to take the inevitable reversals in our stride. What ends up looking perfect will, and must, demand long periods when it feels ugly, confused and beyond rescue. We would not give up so easily — because we never expected things to be other than hellish.</p>
<p>In relation to ourselves, a philosophy of imperfectionism inspires the kind of self-compassion that keeps people out of hospital. Of course we’ve messed up large sections of our lives, missed crucial opportunities and done ridiculous things. It is hard for anyone with imagination to look back and not feel intense distress at who they have been. But there is a difference between taking responsibility for our errors and feeling that these must place us beyond redemption.</p>
<p>To believe in human perfection isn’t a bracing way to achieving ever higher standards; it’s a path to breakdown and, at moments of serious mishap, suicide. There is nothing wise about failing to accept of what modest stuff we’re made.</p>
<p>Finally, a philosophy of imperfection is what small children hunger for. The English child psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott was struck by how many of the parents he saw worried that they had not been perfect in their roles: they admitted guiltily to having been sometimes tired, intemperate, disinterested and cynical. Winnicott playfully congratulated them. Children with perfect parents, he remarked, are on the road to psychosis. The task of a parent is not to be perfect, he explained, it is to prepare a child as gently but as thoroughly as possible for the deeply imperfect conditions of life: to help these idealistic small people to accept that frustration is endemic, that bowls fall off tables and shatter, that teddy bears lose their eyes, that car journeys are too long, that parents are astonishingly annoying, that Mum is daft and Dad a fool, that there is too much homework, that many experiences are bitter and that everyone eventually gets old and dies. More than that is not required, insisted Winnicott — in Playing and Reality, a book published in 1953 (the year colour television, a marvellously perfect box, was invented). In his famous formulation, a parent only needs to be ‘good enough’. We can be good enough parents, workers, spouses, friends and humans; that will be sufficient.</p>
<p>The modern world has done us an enormous service in encouraging us to raise our ambitions; it is in danger of creating mass psychosis by failing to remind us clearly enough that we are also — invariably and continuously — silly, mistaken and beautifully ridiculous.</p>
