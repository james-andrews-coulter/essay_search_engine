<p>How to decorate a home: posters, pin-ups and teenage dreams, 1977.</p>
<p>A camp bedroom</p>
<p>A decade after I’d built my childhood camps I was still rearranging things in my bedroom; but this time I was a teenager, I’d saved up my pocket money, and my
  efforts were on a grander scale. I sanded and varnished the floor. I painted the walls a pale sky blue; and, using thin white lines, divided them into a system of panelling, and hung them with
  black-and-white prints. I painted all the furniture white, and insisted on white curtains and white bed linen. I hung white muslin draperies over the bed so that it resembled a four-poster; and
  ornamented it with silver cushions, made by blowing up the empty insides of old wine boxes.</p>
<p>My parents would come in and look around; but now, instead of shouting at me to put everything back in its place, they would smile a little. ‘It’s all, er, wonderfully
  theatrical . . .’ they would say, and then their voices would trail off. ‘Keep going,’ they’d murmur; and then they would leave the room.</p>
<p>They were right. My bedroom was theatrical; looking back on it, I now realize, perhaps comically so. The whole room had the atmosphere of a tart’s boudoir, albeit the very tasteful
  boudoir, I would have said at the time, of a high-class courtesan in the age of Louis XV.</p>
<p>It was a look I had carefully contrived. I’d spent days lying on my bed, flicking through glossy magazines like Architectural Digest and World of Interiors, or gazing
  longingly at luscious films like Diva and Dangerous Liaisons, salivating over the heavily styled salons of continental chatelaines and the loft apartments of bohemian
  millionaires. I guess that was what made my parents smile: we lived in neither a chateau nor a Park Avenue apartment, and I was a teenage boy, albeit a somewhat theatrical one, rather than
  a lady who lunched.</p>
<p>In fact, looking back, I was a typical teenager: one whose aspirations were as wildly out of phase with my realities as anyone else’s. You might have loved the Cure and painted the walls
  black. You might have gone for the Disney Princess look or the sporting-trophy room. I went for rococo boudoir; but my parents, to their credit, didn’t disapprove. They could see that,
  however theatrical it might all have been, I had attempted to make a work of art, resolving, through juxtapositions of paint colour, pattern, light and furniture, my bedroom into a harmonious
  whole. ‘Perhaps you should be an interior decorator,’ they would remark from time to time, ‘you’ve got great taste.’</p>
<p>I agreed, of course: I thought I had exquisite taste, and I thought I knew what that meant. Even at that time I was aware that making a home isn’t just about occupying buildings, or
  furnishing rooms. Home is more than a collection of places and functions; and home should be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>A good decorator has an eye for combinations of things: of space, furniture and objects, of colour and pattern, light, and times of the day. The really good decorator is an alchemist, making
  from media no more precious than paint and paper, atmosphere, taste, harmony and resonance, and, ultimately, beauty. It’s a mysterious magic.</p>
<p>That the metaphors for that magic are so mixed bears testament to just what subtle and mysterious senses the art of home décor can create. As taste it can be bitter, sweet, salt or sour;
  as atmosphere, it is a vapour; as harmony, it vibrates in the air and falls on the ear, as beauty, it resides in the eye of the beholder. Each of these metaphors has a long history all of its own,
  from taste to atmosphere, harmony to the more abstract concept of beauty itself, yet all of their riches might be generated by nothing more than the way a cushion contrasts with a chair, or matches
  the curtains.</p>
<p>Can you taste taste?</p>
<p>Elsie de Wolfe, born in New York in 1865, knew she was going to be a decorator from a very young age; but she didn’t go to university to study interior decoration. Instead, she started her
  career at home on Gramercy Park, serving meals so delicious, in a setting so exquisitely decorated, that all the ladies who lunched there would ask Miss de Wolfe to make over their own houses (and
  their own lunches) in the same manner.</p>
<p>One thing led to another, and soon enough she was Lady Mendl, a member of the European aristocracy and an international sensation, the self-professed foundress of the profession of interior
  decorating, and the author of classic guides to home decoration including The House in Good Taste and, of course, Elsie de Wolfe’s Recipes for Successful Dining.</p>
<p>The latter was, just as the title said, a recipe book. Each page showed a dish, or a meal – and what meals they were: boiled tongue a la Ritz, creamed haddock, and Indian sardine
  squares. But it wasn’t just the food that Lady Mendl had designed. The crockery upon which it was served, the cutlery that was used to eat it, the table cloth, the table, and the chairs on
  which the guests would sit were all part of the recipe too, as was the backdrop of the room in which the dish was going to be eaten.</p>
<p>To dine – and by extension to live – in good taste, the book seemed to say, was to create a miniature, temporary, synaesthetic work of art, that addressed not just taste itself, but
  the other senses too: sight, touch, and even sound.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Elsie de Wolfe’s idea, however unshakeable her self-belief. Even in the most ancient cultures, taste has long been used as a metaphor for beauty. In Sanskrit, the word for
  flavour, rasa, was used to describe modes of classical dance and of emotional register in sacred sculpture. Medieval scholastics had a saying about the mysteries of taste: De gustibus
  non disputandum, they used to say – there’s no accounting for it.</p>
<p>Can you breathe atmosphere?</p>
<p>So let’s try another metaphor to understand what’s going on. The earth’s atmosphere itself is invisible but its effects on the visible are palpable: in the
  difference, for example, between a tropical sunset and a crystalline winter’s day. The effect of climate is something that painters have long been aware of, particularly Romantics like J. M.
  W. Turner, who developed his expertise painting stories at sea. The Fighting Temeraire, for example, is towed into port for the last time under a blazing sunset; while the horrible
  spectacle of Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and the Dying is depicted in the midst of an infernal storm. Later on, Turner applied the expertise he learned out on the water to images
  of homes, too. Nothing captures the stuffy torpor, the gloomy grandeur of an afternoon in a country house like his Interior of Petworth House.</p>
<p>The atmosphere’s effects on the way we feel are also tangible: think of the tension that builds before an August storm, the bad tempers of a blustery autumn morning, or the sleeplessness
  of clear nights under the full moon. In nature, atmospheric conditions dictate the sensory appearance of things, which in turn affects our mood.</p>
<p>But in the decoration of our homes, the reverse process happens. We talk of some colours, for example, as sunny or others as cold, as if they dictated weather systems all of their own; but we
  also use these words to describe temperaments, as if the rooms we decorate could create the dispositions of the people who inhabit them.</p>
<p>Can you hear harmony?</p>
<p>The Italian writer Mario Praz, whose Filosofia Dell’Arredamento was translated into English as the rather more pragmatic Illustrated History of Interior
  Decoration, struggled, in the introduction to his book, to explain what it was he was trying to write a history of. It wasn’t, he was sure, merely a history of architecture or furniture.
  Rather it was a history of the moods that were created when they came together. He called the interiors he was writing about ‘resonance chambers for the soul’,1 and he also used a very particular word for the feelings they conjured up when they resonated in this way.</p>
<p>Stimmung he called them. The word means, literally, ‘tuning’, as an orchestra might tune up to a perfect ‘A’ before a concert. It can also mean the single note
  – almost a ringing, a drone or a hum – which forms the atmospheric background to any piece of orchestral music by Romantic composers like Wagner. Stimmung is a participle of
  the verb stimmen – to ring – and as well as having acoustic connotations, it refers to truth: ‘das stimmt’, they say in German: ‘that rings
  true’. The mood of a room, for Praz, wasn’t something seen. It was heard.</p>
<p>Praz wasn’t the first to make the connection. The association between beauty and music dates back to ancient Greece, when Pythagoras discovered that harmonies that were pleasing to the ear
  were the product of simple mathematical ratios. Pluck two strings, one double the length of the other, and they would sound an octave apart. Change the ratio to 2:3 and the harmony would become a
  perfect fifth. Change it to 3:4 and it would sound a perfect fourth, and so on. Repeat the ratios with glasses of water or bells cast in bronze, and they would produce exactly the same harmonies.
  The mathematics rang true every time.</p>
<p>Pythagoras’ discovery was a crucial step in our understanding of beauty, for the artists and architects who followed him extended his argument. If, say, 1:2 or 2:3 were beautiful
  proportions in music, it was argued, would they not also please the eye? The idea was taken up by architects and artists in ancient Greece, whose temples and even whose sculpted gods were subjected
  to rigid and minute systems of proportion. Those systems were written down by Vitruvius, and then again in the Italian Renaissance, by humanist scholars like Francesco di Giorgio, Leon Battista
  Alberti and Andrea Palladio. Those laws of harmony and proportion have underpinned the canons of classical art and architecture ever since.</p>
<p>The idea that beauty, like musical harmony, is an objective matter remains present in Mario Praz’s concept of Stimmung, mood, atmosphere and ultimately, good taste. When we talk
  about harmony, proportion, balance, and all the rest of it, we are restating a belief that beauty is something objective, verifiable, and, as a consequence, repeatable. Beauty rings true.</p>
<p>Laws of beauty</p>
<p>Elsie de Wolfe might have proclaimed herself founder of the profession of interior decoration in the early twentieth century, but she knew that the practice had an older
  history, and she was the first to admit that her own standards of taste were derived from a more venerable source. It’s the same one that inspired me as a teenager.</p>
<p>She’d learned it on shopping trips around the chateaux of France, picking up eighteenth-century furniture for a song from aristocrats impoverished by a century of revolution. She even
  ended up living there in the end, in a villa she named Trianon for the exquisite home that Marie Antoinette had made for herself before she was deposed.</p>
<p>Elsie de Wolfe is not alone, for if there’s one time and place we associate with good taste, it’s eighteenth-century France. That that taste, an elegant combination of discreet
  gilding, elegant shades of grey, mirror, crystal and parquet, has become something of a global standard, repeatable, verifiable, and objective, is entirely deliberate, for that is precisely what it
  was created to become.</p>
<p>It was born in the late seventeenth century as part of Louis XIV’s strategy of absolute monarchy, in academies and manufactories established to standardize knowledge about all things: the
  sciences, literature, industry and the visual arts. These academies are still with us today; and to be elected to the Académie Française is still one of the highest honours that can
  be bestowed by the French state.</p>
<p>The scholars of Louis XIV’s académie inherited from Pythagoras, Vitruvius, and the Italian Renaissance the idea that beauty is a fixed, objective, universal, and ultimately
  mathematical matter of proportion and harmony. Thus it had been in the golden days of ancient Rome, and thus it should be in modern France. Art and design, they believed, should obey fixed laws;
  and then they set themselves the task of defining those laws.</p>
<p>It was a more complex task than they imagined; for as one of their number, the architect Claude Perrault, observed in his introduction to the works of Vitruvius, modern architecture, even the
  most beautiful modern architecture, ‘has changed some of the Dispositions and Proportions which were observed by the Ancient and Antique Architects’.2 Even so, it was generally agreed to be beautiful, just the same.</p>
<p>It seems, on the face of it, a minor footnote; but it had revolutionary implications for the Académie, for Perrault’s observation mounted a direct challenge to the authority of the
  ancients. If beauty could be achieved by disobeying the ancient laws of classical art, as well as by obeying them, were those laws perhaps not as universal as they might appear, and were there
  other universal laws of beauty, as yet undiscovered?</p>
<p>Perrault took the argument further. Perhaps it was not barbarity, poverty, or ignorance that caused the modern architects of his time to disobey the laws of Vitruvius. Perhaps, he proposed, they
  did it on purpose, because they thought it would be more beautiful to do it that way. Perhaps, he wondered, the laws of beauty were not eternal after all, but were instead conventions, continuously
  shifting in response to social, historical, and geographical circumstances.</p>
<p>It started with a footnote, but Perrault’s distinction between what he called ‘positive’ or absolute beauty and ‘arbitrary’ or conventional beauty reframed the task
  of Louis XIV’s académie, for if there were no such things as fixed, eternal laws of beauty, then its job was not to discover some universal standard, but instead to invent
  customs and conventions for their own times.</p>
<p>The taste of the Ancien Regime, as it changed from the heavy pomposity of the interiors of Louis XIV, to the lighter frivolity of Louis XV, to the (relative) simplicity of Louis XVI,
  represented an evolution in conventions of arbitrary beauty. This evolution was a deliberate creation of the French state, dictated to stimulate the economy by driving the production of luxury
  goods, from furniture to fashion.</p>
<p>The decoration of houses was dictated by conventions and, in some cases, laws about what could or could not be sat on, or lived in, by whom. Gold and white, for example, were the preserve of the
  crown in both dress and interior décor. The colour of your walls was dictated by your family crest, rather than your individual inclination. To overstep the mark was, in the case of Nicholas
  Fouquet, whose magnificent chateau at Vaux le Vicomte inspired the jealousy of Louis XIV, to risk lifetime imprisonment and political disgrace.</p>
<p>But as the power of absolute princes ebbed away, and even more so after the French Revolution removed that power altogether, so the possibility arose that standards of taste could be set by not
  just the Prince and his academy, but by the people too; and that meant that those who could afford to could, and indeed were obliged to, set their own. The modern idea that beauty might lie in the
  eyes of individual beholders was born.</p>
<p>Fashion, taste, and the modern housewife</p>
<p>And that created a new problem altogether, for if neither God nor the King nor his academies nor the Ancients were authorized to tell people what was beautiful and tasteful, who
  was? And what qualified them to do so?</p>
<p>The result was a plethora of advice literature like that of Elsie de Wolfe, including guides on what people should wear and how they should cook, or entertain, or talk to one another. The
  nineteenth century witnessed the birth of a vast industry which is still with us today – this book being only one among its many manifestations.</p>
<p>Charles Eastlake, in his classic of the genre of 1878, Hints on Household Taste, admitted that he wasn’t going to be able to tell his readers how to acquire good taste. The only
  thing he could advise them was, rather vaguely, to be brought up in the middle classes:</p>
<p>The general impression seems to be, that it is the peculiar inheritance of gentle blood, and independent of all training; that, while a young lady is devoting at school, or
      under a governess, so many hours a day to music, so many to languages, and so many to general science, she is all this time unconsciously forming that sense of the beautiful which we call
      taste.3</p>
<p>Like Le Corbusier, Eastlake saw himself as writing a manifesto against what he believed was the superficial consumerism of his time, a time in which, he wrote, ‘there was
  no upholstery which could possibly surpass that which the most fashionable upholsterer supplied’.4</p>
<p>‘When did people first adopt the monstrous notion that “the last pattern out” must be the best?’ he raged.5 Charles
  Eastlake, as you might have guessed, didn’t approve of fashion; and he made a plea for people to furnish their homes in an ‘artistic’ manner, and for home furnishings to be
  designed in the same spirit as the finest painting or sculpture.</p>
<p>But he was canny enough to see that in his feminine audience, fashion was more or less inescapable. ‘Unfortunately,’ he admitted, ‘the world of fashion is so constituted that
  people who move in it are obliged to conform more or less to its rules; and as no lady likes to make herself conspicuous by her dress, she may reasonably abstain from wearing what has long been out
  of date.’6</p>
<p>Beauty, in a modern world in which individuals are free to make their own choices, should logically be the product of individual preference – it should be art – but it was also,
  Eastlake saw, subject to social judgement. It still is.</p>
<p>Homes of distinction</p>
<p>A century later, writing in France, the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu made the same point, albeit in starker terms. Taste, he argued, was a weapon in class war.</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s classic work On Distinction: a Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste was written in the 1970s; and looking back on it now, it seems to describe a stratified,
  stereotyped society, every rung of which was as slavishly addicted to ‘fashion’ as Eastlake’s Victorian women. Bourdieu applied a cruel and a critical eye to them all. The stuffy,
  conservative luxury of the suburban homes of the professional haute bourgeoisie, he wrote, was a socioeconomic weapon they used to show off their wealth. Their poorer cousins in teaching
  and the arts retaliated by using their simple but tasteful homes to show off the learning and the discernment, rather than the hard cash, that they possessed. The aspirational petite
  bourgeoisie, he wrote,</p>
<p>deploys prodigious energy and ingenuity in ‘living beyond its means’. In the home this is done by devising ‘nooks’ and ‘corners’ (the
      ‘kitchen corners’, ‘dining areas’, ‘bedroom corners’, etc. recommended by the women’s magazines) intended to multiply the rooms . . . not to mention
      all the forms of ‘imitation’ and all the things that can be made to ‘look like’ something they are not.7</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the bottom of the social scale, the proletariat exhibited apparent indifference to fashion or taste, preferring sentimental art and filling food.</p>
<p>So the distinction of Bourdieu’s title was a social, rather than an artistic one; but there’s one important thing upon which Eastlake and Bourdieu agreed: that while taste might seem
  to be personal, implicit, and apparently natural, in actual fact it is heavily conditioned.</p>
<p>‘The ideology of natural taste,’ wrote Bourdieu, ‘owes its plausibility and its efficacy to the fact that, like all the ideological strategies generated in the everyday class
  struggle, it naturalizes real differences, converting differences in the modes of acquisition of culture into differences of nature.’8</p>
<p>Bourdieu was keenly aware of the oddness of bringing together the rarefied world of art, beauty, and aesthetic appreciation with the everyday life of the home. The study of domestic
  décor, he noted, was one in which ‘the elaborated taste for the most refined objects is reconnected with the elementary taste for the flavours of food’.9</p>
<p>And yet it’s what we do all the time. No wonder we have so many words for the ways we decorate our homes, from taste, to atmosphere, to Stimmung, to beauty and art themselves. We
  seem to work our way through every sense except the one we are actually describing.</p>
<p>Décor and decorum</p>
<p>But there’s one word we haven’t talked about yet, perhaps the most obvious one of all: decoration itself.</p>
<p>The root of the word is found in the Latin decorum, which, just as it does in English, means appropriateness in modes and manners. After all, to decorate a room is to dress it up for an
  occasion: Successful Dining, as Elsie de Wolfe observed, isn’t only about the food, but also the setting, physical and social, in which it is eaten.</p>
<p>Dining in good taste: the interior of Elsie de Wolfe’s Villa Trianon at Versailles.</p>
<p>Decoration is a sort of scenery; and it always has been. The chief decorators of Louis XIV’s France, like the painter Charles Le Brun, started out as scenographers for the theatre: even
  the great playwright Moliere held the post of the King’s Upholsterer. Vitruvius complained about the theatrical dispositions and sensibilities of the painters and decorators of his time,
  while Mario Praz’s concept of Stimmung was born out of adventures in the performance of music. Even Elsie de Wolfe started out as an actress before she started dining in style.</p>
<p>I guess that’s why my parents couldn’t help smiling when they saw what I’d done to my teenage bedroom. They could see I was theatrical. As a child, I’d made
  camps in my bedroom. Now I’d made my bedroom camp. I’d made the room into scenery for a performance that was never going to happen – not while I was a teenager, anyway. I was
  never going to dine there with Elsie de Wolfe or Marie Antoinette. I was just going to lie there on my teenage bed on my own and dream of such things. Theatres and the worlds we encounter in them
  are fictions, and so are homes, which we dress up and decorate for the occasions we want to happen in them.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about your domestic taste, that may be something worth remembering. The tools of the decorator – paint, paper, light, a curtain or two, and the cunning arrangement
  of ornaments – are every bit as makeshift and illusory as flats and props in the theatre, and they can be changed just as quickly. It takes an afternoon to paint a wall, and a few minutes to
  change the wattage in a light bulb. In my opinion, we don’t do it often enough.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ve considered approaches to domestic beauty from Pythagorean mathematics to Marxist deconstruction, Romantic atmospherics to academic disputation. If we’ve
  learned anything, it’s that no one has ever been able to agree on the definition of good taste, and they never will. Beauty is as ephemeral and elusive as the means we use to make it. It
  doesn’t actually matter. Ultimately, the reason for decorating your home isn’t to create an eternal work of art, to glorify the monarch, or to go one better than the neighbours.</p>
<p>It’s simpler than that: the purpose of decorating your house is to create scenery for the life, real or not, you’d like to live in it.</p>
