        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Try answering these questions about your relationship with the parent of the gender you’re attracted to:</p>
<p>•   How giving and warm were they emotionally?</p>
<p>•   What was their relationship to their own sexuality?</p>
<p>•   Did they make you feel they could be relied upon?</p>
<p>•   How did they express annoyance, or need? How has this influenced you today?</p>
<p>The core trajectory of our questions is to help reveal that – even if it was a long time ago and even if we don’t wish to pin blame crudely on anyone – we have internalised a less-than-perfect legacy. We have been left to navigate our adult love lives on the basis of a complex inherited template.</p>
<p>Every childhood is guaranteed to lend us a variety of psychological excesses and deficiencies. Acknowledging a troubled emotional history doesn’t automatically make a distortion disappear, but it may radically change our perspective on ourselves – and, in turn, allow a partner to be more sympathetic around our trying behaviours (we can forgive rather a lot, once we have a sound narrative about where a problem originated). We may, after long periods of introspection, still feel the impulse to be controlling about a partner’s routines or timekeeping – but once we understand the link between our emotions and, for example, a father’s early unreliability or a mother’s sadism, we can be newly aware that our suspicion and our questioning aren’t any sort of reasonable response to a partner’s actual needs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, with a psychological history in mind, we will know how to be kinder to ourselves. Instead of getting worked up that our partner has mispronounced a French word or mentioned (for the third time this evening) that we are spending too much money, we will feel sorry for ourselves for the unhelpful dynamics in our pasts that now make such things feel – at points – unbearable to us. We will weep rather than shout.</p>
<p>The person who sees and admits what went wrong in the past may, in the heat of the moment, still not always be able to prevent themselves from ‘acting out’, but their chances of subsequent apology rise enormously; they will be able to say sorry from a deep place.</p>
