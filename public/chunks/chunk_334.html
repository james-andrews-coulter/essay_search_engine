        <h3>6 Mental health</h3>
<p>The world became so ugly because we forgot to argue that a concern for the visual realm isn’t an elite pastime: it belongs to mental health. At its most acute, the places we live in determine the sort of people we can be.</p>
<p>In a degraded environment, however safe and rich our material lives, our spirits will sink. We take our cues from what the buildings around us ‘speak about’. If they speak of grace and charm, kindness and light, our mood will be buoyant; if, however, they seem to threaten and intimidate us, we will feel humiliated and cowed. Modernity has had little respect for our fragility. It has imagined that, so long as the roof didn’t leak, we could dwell among buildings of unsurpassed ugliness and not lose our will to live.</p>
<p>Bologna, Italy.</p>
<p>We cannot blame poverty for the ugly world we have built. It used to be a reassuring assumption that money would eventually assure beauty for all. But modernity has taught us a darker lesson: that what ultimately makes for good architecture are sensible ideas and that we have built an ugly world out of stupidity, not lack of resources.</p>
<p>It’s a stupidity we pay dearly for. A dumb book or song can be shelved and disturb no one. A dumb building will stand defacing the Earth and upsetting all who must look at it for hundreds of years. On this basis alone, architecture is the most important of the arts — and, to enforce the problem further, the one we are never taught anything about in school.</p>
<p>As a result of our lack of education, we don’t hold our governing classes to account. We don’t know how to articulate our distaste for ugliness politically. We have been taught how to say we want a richer world, a fairer world, or a greener world.</p>
<p>We are still stumbling in how to clamour that we also want a more beautiful world. The promise of modernity had been to make the most important things available cheaply to all: no longer would lovely food or clothes, holidays or medicines, be just the preserve of the rich. Industrial technology would open up quality for everyone. But, paradoxically, one key ingredient we all long for has been rendered more exclusive than ever through our inability to think clearly. The one thing we can’t appear to mass produce is beautiful architecture.</p>
<p>As a result, what nice architecture there is, most of it built before 1900, is hugely oversubscribed and costlier than it ever was at the height of the aristocratic age, while the few pleasant streets that remain collapse under a weight of tourists. We have democratised comfort and made beauty exclusive. The challenge is to remember our longing for beauty and to fight the forces of modernity that would keep us from acting on it.</p>
