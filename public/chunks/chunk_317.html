        <h3>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</h3>
<p>At one level, this was inconvenient, not least because Maslow had proposed that once humans had fulfilled their basic needs, they would quickly move on to thinking only about their higher needs: once they had a car and some summer and winter clothes, they would naturally aspire to what Maslow cryptically but tantalisingly called ‘self-actualisation’. This appeared to presage economic disaster for advertisers and their clients. If someone already had a slightly battered but roadworthy 1948 Tucker Torpedo in the garage, their need for transportation would be satisfied; there would be no way to interest them in a 1953 Studebaker Commander Starliner or an Oldsmobile ‘Rocket’ V8. And if someone already had a few quite serviceable clothes, they would have no interest in a new grey flannel suit from Eagle or a couple of summer jackets from Springweave. By so efficiently catering to humanity’s basic needs, America’s mass production industries were in danger of engineering their own demise.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them, there was an important suggestion of salvation lurking in Maslow’s work. Maslow had implied that when humans are distracted or insufficiently guided, when their spiritual ambitions have been thwarted or left fallow, they may neglect their higher needs and develop disproportionate appetites for lower ones instead. This provided a promising opening to advertisers. It now seemed that the way to get customers shopping was not to emphasise the capacity of a product to fulfil a basic need, as advertisers had always naively assumed. The basic need was likely to have been addressed a long time ago; the customer probably already had a car, they almost certainly had enough clothes to keep out the elements. Instead the move was to try to elicit an ambition to buy a product catering to a basic need by alluding to a higher one. It was to imply an offer of a solution to a vital spiritual hunger while in fact — at the last moment — swerving to direct the customer to a shirt or a car, a washing machine or a breakfast cereal. So long as the possibility of fulfilling a higher need was conveyed with sufficient artistry, customers might not notice the sleight of hand.</p>

<p>A so-called ‘good’ advert now became a very specific proposition; a piece of communication that could delicately connect, in the viewer’s mind, a ‘basic’ object to a vaguely relevant but inaccessible ‘higher’ need. A car might be twinned with a search for love, through imagery of an embracing couple, perhaps setting off to orgasm on a phallic rocket; a suit advert might be twinned to a search for career fulfilment through the use of actors who appeared self-possessed and authoritative. One would unconsciously think one was acquiring love and meaning while practically investing in a motor car or a cotton suit. It sounded simple, but the move has been the central ingredient powering consumer capitalism ever since.</p>
<p>Nearly every advert now is selling us one material thing while, beneath the surface, hinting at the appeasement of another higher need. It may look as though one is buying a bag or a pair of shoes, a stay in a hotel or a kind of drink, but really what is tickling us unconsciously is a secret promise of the spiritual goods we ache for: a need for love and meaning, connection and calm, understanding and freedom.</p>
<p>Modern advertisers have a good sense of what we want: it’s just that — without admitting it — they refuse to sell it to us. What seems to be on offer isn’t for sale. This is simply because capitalism has not yet managed to produce companies that are interested in addressing the ‘higher’ category of Maslow’s account of our needs. This isn’t to say that such companies will never or could never exist. There is nothing inherently impossible about a company dedicated to providing people with sincere friends or the skills they would need to build a connection with them. It is entirely plausible to imagine a vast corporation devoted to helping people to have more successful relationships or to discover more meaningful ways of leading their lives. It is just that capitalism currently lags behind our best understanding of our own needs; the products and services we tend to buy and sell one another fulfil only one part, and arguably not the most important part, of the spectrum of our needs. We are still waiting for entrepreneurs who will move the aspirations of capitalism towards the higher spectrum, who will build corporations to tackle our spiritual appetites and thereby honour the aspirations of capitalism to make us profoundly rather than only partially satisfied, and to do so not through the deceitful merchandising of superfluous things, but through the genuine satisfaction of the complete range of our needs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we may grow weary of the energies of the selling industry. The central districts of all the world’s largest cities are covered in outsized illuminated displays, many of them ten storeys high, drawing the attention of consumers to items of questionable relevance to the facts of the human condition. At Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, a million people a day glance up at gigantic renderings of hair products and ice lollies, lipsticks and whisky bottles. The night sky is lit up with incantations to deodorant and clothes softener.</p>

<p>It is tempting to conclude that societies have developed a preposterous obsession with selling. In fact, we have always been interested in selling; it is simply what we are selling that has changed.</p>
<p>In the second part of the twelfth century, the largest effort at outdoor illuminated advertising ever undertaken took shape across Northern Europe. In Canterbury and Worcester, Wells and Salisbury, Chartres and Rheims, Metz and Cologne, master builders started work on cathedrals that had vast stained-glass windows, many times brighter and taller than the signs in Piccadilly Circus or Times Square. Rather than trying to interest us in hamburgers and lip balm, these illuminated windows, filled with glittering squares of reds and greens and dazzling petal-shaped arrangements of lilacs and buttercup yellows, had different messages to impart. To audiences below, these illuminated billboards spoke of love and charity, redemption and melancholy. When fully lit up by the rising and setting sun, they spoke in resplendent brightness of kindness and a concern for those weaker or more troubled than us. They wished us to be modest and thoughtful, open-hearted and tender.</p>

<p>We may have no time for the specifics of the religion that sponsored these cathedrals, but the ambition is worth noting. The cathedrals were in the business of selling, yet had their sights on advertising the most complex and noble aspects of our nature. The medieval Christian Church was a multinational business, no less so than a modern corporation, yet it was focused on fulfilling, in Maslow’s sense, our higher needs. It combined financial acumen, managerial discipline and psychological intent, which, for all the Church’s many faults, remains a provocation to our own times.</p>
<p>We could start to imagine a more dignified version of advertising for the future; one that was less interested in badgering or shouting, in nagging or jollying and, most importantly, that no longer needed to excite our attention by seeming to offer us one thing while in fact selling us another. This kind of advertising would have a different sort of client base, some of whom might still make shirts and haircare products, but others of whom might be pioneering solutions to our higher needs as well. In the shopping districts of the future, there might be gigantic illuminated billboards promoting effective aids for loneliness, cures for broken hearts and strategies for calm. We remain at the dawn of capitalism — and therefore of knowing how honourably to buy and sell one another the many things that we truly need to flourish.</p>
