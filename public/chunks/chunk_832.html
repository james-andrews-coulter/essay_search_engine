        <h2>UNFAIR DISMISSAL IN LOVE</h2>
<p>Our lover has wounded us deeply. Our suffering is comparable to being robbed or physically assaulted. In a way, this hurts more than someone stealing our phone or bicycle. However, in those cases, there are big societal mechanisms for addressing our suffering: There are insurance companies, police forces, courts and ultimately prisons designed to restore justice. If an employer suddenly decides that they can’t stand us, they usually can’t indiscriminately drop us: All kinds of rights and safeguards have been slowly and wisely established to protect our employment from whims and cruelty. Culturally, we’ve focused our collective systems of justice and redress around money, work and property.</p>
<p>But in an area that matters just as much to us – love and relationships – we can’t contact a lawyer or go to the police with an accusation that someone broke our heart. We’re on our own. Not only is there no easy way of getting redress, there’s little on offer to help us deal with the pain. If we have a toothache or a broken leg (which can be comparable to heartbreak in terms of anguish), we are met by a society that has evolved sophisticated ways of dealing with the problem and built enormous institutions to offer us skilled help.</p>
<p>The point isn’t that we should be able to go to a lawyer or a doctor with our complaint; we don’t want our ex-partner to be locked up or to undergo some emergency surgery. But we can, in a utopian spirit, imagine a society that has devoted itself with equal ambition – and over many decades – to addressing the intense, common problems of wounded souls.</p>
<p>The broken-heart specialist of the future would carefully listen to our sobs; they might prescribe that we read a particular book or listen to certain pieces of music (like Mozart’s opera Così fan tutte – ‘Thus Do They All’ – in which every lover is shown to let the other down). We could be invited to examine our expectations of relationships and be coaxed gently but firmly towards an understanding of just what went wrong and what we could learn. We might be prompted to reconsider what kinds of people to be wary of, or to seek out, as we re-enter the world of romance.</p>
<p>It has always been hard for us to imagine large societal responses to private problems – just as in the 17th century it was hard to imagine the existence of a reliable fire brigade. Relationship endings are standard hazards of existence. And perhaps at some point in the future, people heading off to their broken-heart specialists will look back on us with pity because – when our relationships failed – there were not so many places to turn for wisdom, consolation and guidance.</p>
