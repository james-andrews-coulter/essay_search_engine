<p>If one finds oneself at the disagreeing end of such questions, it may be that one is an agitated person not because one has more to worry about but because one likes oneself rather less than normal – and certainly less than one fairly should.</p>
<p>The cure isn’t, therefore, to try to dispel anxiety with logic, it is to try to dispel it with love; it is to remind the anxious person (who may be ourselves) that we are not inherently wretched, that we have a right to exist, that past neglect wasn’t deserved, that we should feel tenderly towards ourselves – and that we need, both metaphorically and probably practically too, a very long hug.</p>
<p>The logic of this analysis is truly counter-intuitive. It suggests that when panic next descends, one should not spend too long on the surface causes of the worry but instead try to address the self-hatred fuelling the agitation. Anxiety is not always anxiety; sometimes it is just a very well-disguised, entrenched and unfair habit of disliking who we are.</p>
