        <h2>Monogamy</h2>
<p>To a greater extent than we perhaps realise, when it comes to what sort of relationship we are allowed to have, our societies present us with a menu with only a single option on it: the monogamous, cohabiting romantic relationship, usually served with a side order of children.</p>
<p>But what is striking, for an arrangement that is supposed to be entirely normal, is just how many people cannot abide by its rules. Around half flunk completely, and a substantial portion muddle along in quiet desperation.</p>
<p>In our societies, those who can’t get on with Romantic monogamous marriage are quickly diagnosed as suffering from a variety of psychological disorders: fear of intimacy, clinginess, sexual addiction, frigidity, boundary issues, self-sabotage, childhood trauma, etc.</p>
<p>But there might be another approach, this one drawn from the pioneering work of advocates of LGBTQIA+ rights, namely that any taste or proclivity must by definition be acceptable and non-pathological, except in so far as it might hurt the unwilling or unconsenting. From this perspective, while many ways of life might be different to society’s presently preferred option, it cannot be right to judge, correct, amend and seek to re-educate all those attracted to them.</p>
<p>In love, we accept an absence of choice that would be intolerable in other areas of life. We consent to wearing a uniform that cannot possibly fit our varied shapes, and without daring to make even minor moves to assemble our own wardrobe. All our collective energies go into creating astonishing varieties of foods, machines and entertainment, while the entity that dominates our lives – our relationships – continue in a format more or less unchanged for 200 years.</p>
<p>It would be a genuine liberation if, whenever a new couple came together, it was assumed that they almost certainly would not go along with the Romantic monogamous template, and that the onus was therefore on them to discuss – up front, in good faith and without insult – the arrangements that would ideally satisfy their natures.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, male offspring of the European upper classes had only two career options: to join the army or to join the church. Such narrow-mindedness was eventually dismissed as evident nonsense and eradicated, and the average citizen of a developed country now has thousands of job options to choose from. We should strive for a comparable expansion of our menus of love. We are not so much bad at relationships, as unable – presently – to understand our needs without shame, to stick up politely for what makes us content, and to invent practical arrangements that could stand a chance of honouring our complex emotional reality.</p>
