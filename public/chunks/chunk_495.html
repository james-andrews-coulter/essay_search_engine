        <h2>Romantic Disappointment</h2>
<p>Often our partner isn’t terrible in any big way, but we feel a growing sadness about our relationship: they’re not as focused on us as we’d hoped; they don’t understand us fully; they’re preoccupied, a bit abrupt, not hugely interested in the details of our day; they call their friends rather than talk with us. We feel disenchanted and let down, and may start to think we’re with the wrong person.</p>
<p>This sorrow has a paradoxical source: early childhood. At the best moments of childhood, a loving parent offered us extraordinary satisfaction. They knew when we were hungry or tired, even though we couldn’t explain. They made us feel completely safe. They were enchanted by our smallest achievements. We were entertained and indulged.</p>
<p>As adults, we continue to be in thrall to this notion of being loved, and find our partners sorely wanting as a result. It’s a natural but profoundly unfair comparison. Our needs were so much simpler then. We didn’t need someone to trawl intelligently through the troubled corners of our minds and understand why it is necessary to see our aunt on Sunday, why it matters to us that the curtains harmonise with the sofa covers, or why bread must be cut with a proper bread knife. Our partner is stumbling in the dark around needs that are immensely subtle, far from obvious and very complicated to deliver on.</p>
<p>The source of our present sorrow is not, therefore, that our adult lovers are tragically inept or uniquely selfish. It’s rather that we’re judging our adult experiences in the light of a very different kind of childhood love. We are sorrowful not because we have landed with the wrong person, but because we have grown up.</p>
