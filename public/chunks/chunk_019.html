            <h3>7. The diﬃculty of imagining the loneliness of others</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why we tend not to make friends as often as we might comes down to a powerful background idea whose full destructive force we may not even be aware of: the belief that any decent person already has all the friends they need.</p>
<p>Somewhere in our minds, the notion has been lodged that only very sad and inept people would – at this stage in their lives (whatever stage one happens to be at) – still have a space in their social agenda for a new entrant. Everyone else – anyone worth knowing, anyone talented, interesting and good – would long ago have acquired the gang to which they are now continuously and irredeemably wedded.</p>
<p>What this idea misses is the extent to which loneliness and disenchantment are ongoing and universal possibilities, and not limited to those of reduced appeal and capacities. Right now, the enchanting actor is (despite the crowds) lonely, as is the feted concert pianist, the renowned biologist, the skilled airline pilot, the miraculous neurosurgeon and that rather nice-looking person you have just spotted in the corner of the room laughing animatedly with a group of fashionable companions.</p>
<p>Anyone of sensitivity and charm might fail to find the right sort of allies, outgrow their friends from school or university, land on uncongenial spirits at work and spend a lot of evenings on their own, either physically or spiritually. And we can know this for certain of other people because we know it, first and foremost, from a very reliable source: ourselves.</p>
<p>We need to battle the part of our minds that reads our isolation as a selective punishment and vanquish it with evidence available directly from our own experience. Other people who know us almost certainly find it hard to imagine that we are lonely and that we’d like to locate a wise, tender, funny and interesting new friend, and it’s statistically improbable that we would be outliers in this respect. What holds true for us must and will hold true for others.</p>
<p>We have built a predominantly cold and guarded society by imagining a thesis that we know to be untrue on the basis of our own experience. We have allowed self-hatred and shame to cloud our judgement and reduce what is in fact a universal aﬄiction and possibility to the status of a personal curse.</p>
<p>The next time we spot an interesting person, we should disregard our initial assumption that they have all the friends they need. We don’t have exactly the right people in our circle – and neither, most probably, do they. We can afford to shed our false background thesis of social existence and go and say hello.</p>
