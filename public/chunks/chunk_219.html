            <h3>Dealing with depression</h3>
<p>Almost half of us will suffer from depression at some point in our lives, but the condition remains badly misunderstood and therefore often poorly treated. At the heart of our collective difficulty with depression is a confusion about what it actually is – in particular, how it can be distinguished from a state all of us know very well and with which it shares a number of similarities: sadness. We often unwittingly apply to cases of depression assumptions drawn from an understanding of sadness, and therefore end up suffering far more than we should.</p>
<p>On the surface, there are similarities between those who are sad and those who are depressed. Both groups cry; both withdraw from the world; both complain of listlessness and a sense of alienation from their normal lives. But there is one categorical difference between depression and sadness: the sad person knows what they are sad about; the depressed person doesn’t.</p>
<p>Sad people can, without difficulty, tell us what is troubling them. They are sad that their pet died, or that they lost their job, or that their friends are unkind. The depressed person is not capable of doing this. They may be tearful, but they cannot conclusively identify what has drained life of meaning for them: they simply say it has no meaning per se. They aren’t depressed about X or Y as one might be sad about X or Y. They are simply depressed.</p>
<p>The inability of the depressed person to account for their mood can lay them open to unwarranted charges of faking, malingering or exaggerating. Friends looking for a solvable problem can end up frustrated by lack of progress. When pushed, the depressed person might latch on to rather odd or minor-sounding issues to account for their state: they might complain that there is no point going to work because the Earth is due to be absorbed by the Sun in 7.5 billion years. Or they might insist that life lacks all meaning because they’ve broken a glass and everything is now completely hopeless.</p>
<p>One often hears that if depression has no obvious psychological causes, the problem must be bound up with an imbalance in brain chemistry, which can be treated with pills. This is an idea that greatly appeals to the pharmaceutical industry, but also to worried families, schools and employers who crave rapid and cost-effective solutions.</p>
<p>However, there is another approach to depression that, although slower and more arduous, may be much more effective in the long term. This stems from insights drawn from psychotherapy, the discipline that arguably has been able to understand depression better than any other. The basic premise of psychotherapy is that the depressed person is not depressed for no reason; there is a reason. They are distressed about something, but that something is proving difficult to take on board, and has therefore been pushed into the outer zones of consciousness, from where it wreaks havoc on the whole person, prompting boundless feelings of nihilism.</p>
<p>For depressives, realising what they are concretely upset about would be too devastating. Therefore, they unconsciously choose to remain dead to everything as opposed to very distraught about something. Depression is sadness that has forgotten its true causes – forgotten because remembering may generate overwhelming, untenable feelings of pain and loss.</p>
<p>What might these true causes be? Perhaps that we have married the wrong person, or that our sexuality isn’t what we once believed, or that we are furious with a parent for their lack of care in childhood. In order to preserve a fragile peace of mind, one then ‘chooses’ (although that may sound more willed than it is in reality) to be depressed rather than to have a realisation. We pick unceasing numbness as protection against dreadful insight.</p>
<p>To make things even more difficult, the depressed person typically does not consciously feel that they are lacking insight. They are not aware of a gap in their self-understanding. Furthermore, they are often taught to assume that they are ‘just depressed’, as one might just be physically ill – a verdict that can appeal as much to the pharmaceutical industry as to certain people close to the depressed person with an interest in insights remaining buried.</p>
<p>There is another key difference between sadness and depression. Sad people are grief-stricken about something out in the world, but they aren’t necessarily sad about themselves; their self-esteem is unaffected by their grief. Conversely, depressed people characteristically feel wretched about themselves and are full of self-recrimination, guilt, shame and self-loathing paranoia that may, at tragic extremes, culminate in suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>For psychotherapy, the origins of this self-hatred lie in anger due for, but unable to be directed towards, someone else in the world, which has then turned against the sufferer. Wrathful feelings that should have gone outwards – towards a partner who is relentlessly defensive and denies one sex, or a parent who humiliated one in childhood – are driven back onto the sufferer and start to attack them. The feeling ‘X has let me down horribly’ turns into the unpleasant but in some ways more bearable ‘I’m an unworthy and unbearable wretch.’ One becomes self-hating as a defence against the risks of hating someone else.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that, in many cases, depression is associated with an apparently opposite mood, a euphoric state termed ‘mania’; hence the term ‘manic depressive’. The mania in question looks, from a distance, something like happiness, just as depression can resemble sadness. But in one area, the relationship between mania and happiness is identical to that between depression and sadness. The common element is a disavowed self-knowledge. In mania, one is euphoric but cannot go into one’s own deep mind and discover its bitter truths. This explains one of the leading characteristics of manic people: their habit of being in flight from themselves, talking too fast about nothing, over-exercising, working continuously or spending too much – all as an escape from a submerged grief, rage and loss.</p>
<p>It is from this kind of diagnosis that a suggested cure emerges. What people in depression need above all is a chance to arrive at insight. For this, they will tend to need a supportive and patient listener. They may also benefit from temporary use of medication, if used appropriately, to lift their mood just enough so that they can endure a conversation. However, the assumption is not that brain chemistry is where the problem either begins or ends; the despair is caused by an undigested, unknown and unresolved trauma. Far from needing to be taken through reasons to trust that life is beautiful, depressives must be allowed to feel and to remember specific damage, and to be granted a fundamental sense of the legitimacy of their emotions. They need to be allowed to be angry, and for the anger to settle on the right, awkward targets.</p>
<p>The goal in treating depression is to move a sufferer from feeling limitlessly despairing to mourning the loss of something in particular: the last twenty years, a marriage, a hope that one would be loved by one’s father, a career … However agonising the insight and mourning might be, these must always be preferable to allowing loss to contaminate the totality of one’s perspective. There are plenty of dreadful things in every life, which is why it is normal to feel sad on a regular basis. But there are also a sufficient number of things that remain beautiful and hopeful, so long as one has been allowed to understand and know one’s pain and anger and adequately mourn one’s losses.</p>
