        <h2>HOW WE CAN BE HEARTBROKEN EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN’T LEFT</h2>
<p>It sounds paradoxical: that we can be heartbroken even though a lover is still with us. Yet it’s not so strange, because the source of heartbreak is not precisely the physical departure of a lover, but rather the recognition that a partner doesn’t really love us any more – something which we may come to realise even without anyone having taken steps to pack their bags.</p>
<p>The physical presence of a lover isn’t any sort of guarantee against heartbreak. We might be sharing a bed and bills with a partner – but the love there once was between us may have gone forever. Neither of us is leaving, but we’re realising that perhaps for the rest of our lives, we’re going to have to exist without the feeling that our partner is delighted by our presence, fascinated by our character and longing to hold and caress us.</p>
<p>We may be very alone with this situation. If someone walks out of the door, there is great cultural support: There are songs and films, condensed bits of wisdom to lean on (plenty more fish in the sea, etc.) and there are some very moving books. People understand and sympathise.</p>
<p>But the death of love in a continuing relationship has been comparatively neglected. There’s even a distinct lack of sympathy that surrounds the topic: To a romantically minded culture, it can look rather pitiful to stay together for convenience once passion has gone. If romantic love is everything, then a union without desire is a profoundly offensive proposition.</p>
<p>Yet there might be many good reasons to stay together even when our hearts have, quietly, been broken. It’s not what people dream of, but our finances are intertwined, there are shared commitments – perhaps even children – we’ve developed friends in common, we’ve established ways of living together that might be both convenient to us and a great help to others – and there won’t be too many people available who are keen to start a new relationship with someone like us. So we may be wise to stick where we are, despite the deep vein of sorrow and sense of loss that accompanies us through the long evenings.</p>
<p>The support we need is the realisation that, though the situation is painful and undiscussed, it is not for that matter strange or shameful. It is extremely ordinary and even rather noble. If we left and found someone else, we’d probably end up in the same position a few years later – because, in some ways, love almost always dies. The romantic intensity that marked those early years isn’t a description of life together in the long term.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a few exceptions – but we make the mistake of supposing that because very occasionally a couple stays in love for many years, this is a common occurrence. Instead, we should see it the way we might view certain jobs. Of course it’s possible for someone to make a great living by being a stand-up comic, but this is realistically only an option for a very few, deeply unusual individuals: It tells us nothing about what is possible for us.</p>
<p>If we are in a relationship where love has died, we are not particularly missing out, we have not particularly failed: We are simply meeting an ordinary, yet rarely described, fate.</p>
