            <h2>22.Holiday Fling</h2>
<p>Of course the idea of a short-lived holiday romance can sound rather crass or emotionally exploitative. But there’s potentially a good version that links falling in love (even though we know it probably won’t last) to the best ambitions of travel. The ideal lessons that a destination might offer to teach us are not fully contained in its history or its public monuments and museums. They are encoded in the lives of the people who live there: in the way they see the world, in their attitudes to work, to each other, to family.</p>
<p>Romance becomes valid and important as an aspect of tourism because of the way it rapidly deepens a relationship to another person and thereby a place. As we kiss, we overcome the distancing layers of conventional politeness that so often get in the way of encountering another individual. We move to a higher level of communication.</p>
<p>It’s not the physical intimacy itself that really matters. It’s all the other things that happen around it: late into the night, they tell us the inside story of their childhood and how their parents met; we go with them to their local supermarket to get something for lunch; we hear about the troubles of their friends; we get to know their ambitions and their worries. Perhaps the most poignant moment is when they unlock their front door: we pass out of the street that anyone can walk along and enter their private world. We get to see the places that are usually closed off from the tourist. We hear about their schooldays and what it was like looking for work. They tell us about their boss and their colleagues.</p>
<p>All these details educate us. What can grandly be called the ‘spirit of the place’ – the thing that we’ve travelled to meet – stops being an abstract, intellectual notion. It becomes more tangible and more specific; it’s earthed. We’re not just looking for random company: we want to meet an individual who properly represents the virtues of their locality. It might seem foolish to connect with someone so intensely for such a brief moment when we know they live hundreds of miles and several time zones away from us and yet, when things go right, we may really be doing, in the most direct and profound way, the very thing that we came here to do: learning and growing through contact with important virtues and attitudes that are missing in ourselves.</p>
