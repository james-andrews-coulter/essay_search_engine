        <h3>York, England, thirteenth century</h3>
<p>You are trained from infancy in your line of work; there’s always a master standing nearby telling you what to do, watching you every minute. Intellectual work is confined to restating traditional ideas: no one is expected to be original. You are born into a station in life and it is almost impossible to rise or fall out of it.

Projects are expected to advance very slowly: it takes a few centuries to build a cathedral and no one minds too much.</p>
