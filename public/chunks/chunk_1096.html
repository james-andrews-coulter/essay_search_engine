        <h2>The First Day</h2>
<p>In 1963, the London Sunday Times sent the already much-celebrated 26-year-old artist David Hockney to Egypt on an assignment to record the great monuments of antiquity: the pyramids outside Cairo, the temples of Luxor and Karnak and the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Egypt astonished Hockney and induced in him a state of almost perpetual creativity, where everything seemed to hold a secret, and everything was worthy of investigation and reflection. He sketched on whatever was to hand: old envelopes, hotel-room notepapers and the inside covers of his books. However, what struck him most were not the obvious tourist destinations so much as the details of ordinary Egyptian life: the watch of the man at reception, the sandals of the newspaper seller, the signs for the dry-cleaner and the television repair shop.</p>
<p>On arrival in Alexandria, Hockney sat on the terrace of the Hotel Cecil and not only drew the titular Egyptian waiter, but also carefully documented the label on a bottle of local mineral water from the El Natrun valley and a packet of cigarettes. In its delicacy and observational precision (Hockney knew no Arabic), this astonishing study of a bottle might be an emblem of what it means to be properly attuned to a place — to put aside our usual cares and surrender to the interest and beauty of the world, as a child might, as artists will and as we almost never do.</p>
<p>Generally, we notice almost nothing, but we may make an exception for one particular time and place: the first day in a new destination. There and then, for once, we too may be shaken from our customary lethargy. Everything leaps out at us: how peculiar the taxis are, the smells in the street, the sound of passers-by, the clothes of the old. Our eyes open properly, as they last did when we were 2 years old and it took us half an hour to get home from the park because there was so much for us to study on the way.</p>
<p>The state is unlikely to last long. After a few days, we tend to go back to our habitual myopia. But even if we only manage it for a short while, the receptivity of that first day remains a possibility that we should strive to enact more regularly and generously, even in places closer to home. We shouldn’t need another continent to start to appreciate the texture of existence. We knew how to do so as a small person, and we might do so again. Artists are, in this context, only the emissaries of an appropriately appreciative relationship to the world of which we are all, in theory, capable.</p>
<p>Our travels have an overwhelming lesson to teach us: that we need, whenever we can, to try to look at our lives — with which it is so easy to get dispirited and about which it is so forgivable to despair — as though we were still in some ways on that hopeful, endlessly fascinating first day somewhere else, when even a label on a bottle of water has something important to whisper to us.</p>
