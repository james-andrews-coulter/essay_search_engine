        <h2>WHY AM I WITH THIS PERSON?</h2>
<p>Typically, when asked why we are marrying someone, we feel pressured to respond by listing the ways they are lovely to be with. But a bigger, fairer explanation of why we’re with them, and why they might be a good spouse for us, involves exploring three questions: What might I learn from them? In what ways has my past constrained my choice of partner? And what pragmatic or ‘low’ reasons might I have for getting together with them?</p>
<p>We will look at each in turn.</p>
<p>i. What we need to learn from our partners</p>
<p>A lot of what drives our search for love is a desire for strengths in a partner – more particularly, strengths that we don’t possess ourselves. We picked them because they know how to do and be certain things that elude us.</p>
<p>Our ‘weaknesses’ – our deficiencies, frailties and imperfections – are crucial components in our excitement around our lover. We love because we are incomplete and unbalanced. We might be over-intellectual and therefore find them delightfully down-to-earth. We may be a bit flighty and chaotic and so think them wonderfully ordered and precise.</p>
<p>Table 1</p>
<p>Ideally, we want to learn from a lover and become a little more like them. Helped by their central place in our lives, we will become calmer or more confident or more adventurous or better at organising ourselves. The dream is that they will teach us by example and encouragement and that, under the protection of their love, we will grow to our full potential.</p>
<p>This means that the success of the marriage will depend on two things: our willingness truly to learn the lessons on offer, and our partner’s readiness to be a good teacher. The trouble is, most of us are not especially good at either side of the equation.</p>
<p>In reality, we often fail to learn from our partner’s strengths. It feels humiliating to own up to the many ways in which we’re far from perfect. It’s annoying to have to make the real changes in our thinking and behaviour that are required. Although theoretically we want to evolve, under pressure, we too often end up feeling our partner should do that infinitely comforting thing: just love us as we are. Because their strengths carry with them a need for evolution, we can start to see them as punishing and nasty. At first we liked their down-to-earth quality, but in time we may denigrate it as naive and simplistic. We may originally have admired their neat and orderly ways, but, when we’re struggling, we’re inclined to blame them for being rigid, anal and uncreative. When it’s painful for us to improve ourselves, we turn on the ‘teacher’ and accuse them of preventing us from remaining the person we know deep down we shouldn’t be any longer.</p>
<p>We’re not very good students – and our partner might not be a very adept teacher either. They know plenty of things we could usefully absorb, but they may grow impatient and stern in the way they convey these. They get annoyed by our failings and feel (and might sometimes say) that we are hopeless. When confronted by our hesitancy and inhibitions, they don’t become brilliant coaches who carefully lead us by small, manageable steps; they become frustrated and let us know that we’re dreary, conformist bores. Around our difficulties with practical matters, they may not sympathetically reduce our anxiety and heap encouraging praise on our tentative efforts. They merely sigh impatiently and tell us to get out of the way because they’re obviously going to have to take care of everything themselves.</p>
<p>As a result, we become further entrenched in our pre-existing pattern of strengths and weaknesses. The one who is more financially minded ends up doing everything around money, and the other gets more and more passive around it. The more domestic one ends up doing practically everything around the house; the more creative one comes to feel they have less and less in common with their staid companion.</p>
<p>But we’re not condemned to follow this unfortunate path if we have it clear in our heads that a reason for getting married is to learn and to teach. A pedagogical explanation of why we are with someone shows us that we’ll have to be gracious enough to admit our failings and adopt the role of a genuine student. At other points, in our role as a teacher, we’ll need to avoid getting impatient and self-righteous with our inevitably slow and faltering student. To be married with a degree of success, we will have to accept the nobility and necessity of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>ii. We can’t love just anyone</p>
<p>Theoretically, we are free to select the kind of person we marry. We might have chosen someone else. We’re not being forced into this by social convention, matchmaking aunts or dynastic imperatives. But in reality our choice is probably much less free than we imagine. Some very real constraints around who we can love and feel properly attracted to come from a place we might not think to look: our childhoods. Our psychological history strongly predisposes us to fall only for certain types of people.</p>
<p>We love along grooves formed in childhood. We look for people who in many ways recreate the feelings of love we knew when we were small. The problem is that the love we imbibed in childhood was unlikely ever to have been made up simply of generosity, tenderness and kindness. Given the way the world is, love was liable to have come entwined with certain very painful aspects: a feeling of not being good enough; a love for a parent who was fragile or depressed; a sense that one could never be fully vulnerable around a caregiver.</p>
<p>This predisposes us to look in adulthood for partners who won’t necessarily simply be kind to us, but who will most importantly feel familiar – a subtly but importantly different thing. We may be constrained to look away from prospective candidates because they don’t satisfy a yearning for the complexities we associate with love. We may describe someone as ‘not sexy’ or ‘boring’ when in truth we mean ‘unlikely to make me suffer in the way I need to suffer in order to feel that love is real’.</p>
<p>It is common to advise people who are drawn to tricky candidates simply to leave them and find someone more wholesome. This is as theoretically appealing as it is practically impossible. We cannot magically redirect the wellsprings of our attraction. Rather than aim for a transformation in the types of people we are attracted to, it may be wiser simply to adjust the way we respond and behave around the occasionally difficult characters whom our past mandates we will find compelling.</p>
<p>Our problems are often generated because we continue to respond to compelling people in the way we learned to behave as children around their templates. For instance, maybe we had an irate parent who often raised their voice. We loved them, and reacted by feeling that when they were angry we must be guilty. We became timid and humble. Now if a partner (to whom we are magnetically drawn) gets cross, we respond as squashed, brow-beaten children: we sulk; we feel it’s our fault; we feel got at and yet deserving of criticism; we build up a lot of resentment. Or if we had a fragile, vulnerable parent who was easily hurt, we readily end up with a partner who is also a bit weak and demands that we care for them, but then we get frustrated by their weakness – we tiptoe around them, we try to encourage and reassure (as we did when we were little), but we also condemn this person for being undeserving.</p>
<p>We probably can’t change our templates of attraction. But rather than seek to radically re-engineer our instincts, we can try to learn to react to them not as we did as children but in the more mature and constructive manner of a rational adult. There is an enormous opportunity to move ourselves from a childlike to a more adult pattern of response in relation to the difficulties to which we are attracted. (See Table 2, overleaf on page 50.)</p>
<p>We are almost certainly with somebody who has a particularly knotty set of issues that trigger both our desires and our childlike defensive moves. The answer isn’t to end the relationship, but rather to strive to deal with the challenges of our partner with wisdom of which we weren’t capable when we first encountered these in a parent or caregiver. It probably isn’t in our remit to locate a wholly grown-up person, but it is always in our power to strive to behave in more grown-up ways around our partner’s less mature sides.</p>
<p>Table 2</p>
<p>iii. Romantic vs. pragmatic motives</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we might be planning to build a life with someone. But within our culture, not all reasons are deemed equal. We could divide our motives into the categories of the Romantic and the pragmatic. (See Table 3, overleaf on page 52.)</p>
<p>At present, our culture hugely favours the Romantic reasons, and leaves us to feel guilty and soiled around the pragmatic ones. It can be shameful to think that a major motive for marrying someone is that we find them extremely attractive. Or to recognise that if they didn’t have their present income, the pull would be far less intense. We would be unlikely to admit to a friend that we were thrilled to be joining our lives with someone who had admirably compatible views on how to keep a kitchen.</p>
<p>But that is only because we are in denial about who we really are. We are creatures who delight in the union of two hearts, who long to find our feelings of melancholy and purpose reflected in the eyes of another, and who have tender and vast thoughts under star-filled skies late on Saturday nights. However, we also have our nine-on-Monday-morning identities, when we are practical, resolute, uninclined to pathos and flights of fancy and highly appreciative of punctuality and good order.</p>
<p>Table 3</p>
<p>A sound marriage requires an adroit blend of romantic and practical sympathies. Much of what we are attempting to do will rely on logistical talents that support rather than undermine our romantic concerns. The point of having a bit of money is to enable us to stop thinking about it all the time. The point of an ordered house is to prevent us having to spend too many hours rooting around at the backs of cupboards. Our lives become a lot more boring when we stubbornly refuse to pay any attention to ‘boring things’.</p>
<p>Furthermore, agreement on pragmatic issues can sustain us when agreement on romantic ones proves elusive. It is easy to lose patience with someone’s soul, but perhaps harder to lose sight of the importance of clean linen or a reassuringly administered bank account. Prosaic, materialistic thoughts are there to help us stay together while we learn to cope more maturely with the emotional conflicts that accompany us through our lives.</p>
<p>A marriage is a deeply practical project. It is akin to an attempt to run a small business together; one that involves property law, catering, holiday tours, entertainment, kindergarten management and home decoration. If we insist on seeing our partner’s organisational skills, financial acumen or prowess as a host as simply ‘low’, we won’t recognise the very genuine contributions these assets might make to our existence.</p>
<p>It is strategically useful to get more explicit about identifying the most pragmatic reasons why we have picked our partner, and perhaps to sum these up in a (secret) list we keep in a bedside drawer. Ideally we’d return to the list at points of crisis in order to remind ourselves of just why we ended up choosing as we did, until such time as we succeed in recovering admiration for, and connection to, our partner’s soul.</p>
