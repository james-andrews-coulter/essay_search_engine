        <h3>7 Our existence: cosmic gratitude</h3>
<p>At first glance, it may not be evident how a discipline as reserved and sober as science could lead us to an intense appreciation of all that is good in our lives and a wonder at the benevolence and beauty of our surroundings. But science is capable of nurturing feelings of gratitude because of a basic truth about the way gratitude works: it arises out of a sense of contrast, from an awareness of how much more awful things might have been, of how dreadful things can get — and of how lucky, all things considered, we have turned out to be.</p>
<p>There are a million things that we have missed out on and areas of pain that continue to scar us, but science bids us to look up and remember some of the larger reasons we possess to be thankful.</p>
<p>When our psyches allow us a moment of respite, we can be grateful for all the seemingly random circumstances in place for us to even exist...</p>
<p>• That 13.8 billion years ago, something smaller than an electron chose to swell within a fraction of a second like an expanding balloon into a zone permeated with energy ninety-three billion light years in size that we now clumsily call the universe.</p>
<p>• That some of the energy from this swift expansion was able to coagulate into particles, which grouped together to form the light atoms of hydrogen, lithium and helium — which then assembled into galaxies, which gave birth to stars, inside whose molten burning cores all the elements necessary for the nucleic acids essential to life — carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus — were forged.</p>
<p>• That gravity drew the stars together to form galaxies (a hundred billion of them), including — fortuitously — the Milky Way, a small corner of the universe containing just 400 billion stars, in which our sun was born out of a giant, spinning cloud of dust and gas four and a half billion years ago.</p>
<p>• That around the same time, swarms of debris collided to form our Earth — a lava-washed, uninhabitable rock, that gravity happened to throw into orbit as the third planet from the Sun — the exact right distance away (0.38 to 10.0 astronomical units) for life to develop.</p>
<p>• That another planet, Theia, collided with Earth, gifting us our Moon, which slowed the Earth’s rotation, stabilised atmospheric conditions and created the twenty-four-hour day and caused the Earth to tilt, forming the seasons, without which we would have permanent regional extremes of heat and cold, drought and floods.</p>
<p>• That ice particles left over from the collisions of hundreds of comets melted, water vapour condensed and then oceans were formed.</p>
<p>• That comet collisions delivered another chance cosmic gift, the essential components of life and DNA like ribose, carbon dioxide, ethanol, amino acids and phosphorus.</p>
<p>• That underwater hot springs released the right amount of energy and just the right mix of chemicals to allow the first single-cell organisms, prokaryotes, to form four billion years ago.</p>
<p>• That Earth’s toxic atmosphere of methane and carbon dioxide slowly became sweetened by the release of oxygen from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) — the first creatures to photosynthesise — and gradually oxygenated eighty-five per cent of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>• That 2.7 billion years ago, a random, chance event known as ‘the fateful encounter’ meant that two single cells merged, and procreated and then after about a billion more years, developed sexes.</p>
<p>• That 500 million years ago, plants spread from the oceans to the land before animals did and slowly developed into more complex vascular plants, whose seeds could be dispersed by wind, creating grasslands and forests in which different species could evolve.</p>
<p>• That 245 million years ago, a rise in oxygen levels led to the Cambrian explosion, which saw the greatest diversification of life in Earth’s history, starting with ocean-dwelling hard-shelled invertebrates, leading to new fish species, the first land-based insects and large vertebrate ocean animals that developed four limbs and went ashore to lay eggs — which hatched and evolved into amphibians, reptiles and mammals.</p>
<p>• That an asteroid fifteen kilometres wide just happened to hit Earth 65.5 million years ago and destroyed most terrestrial organisms including all non-avian dinosaurs, but also created ideal conditions in which furry mammals, our close ancestors, were able to thrive with less competition and evolved into primates.</p>
<p>• That the Earth remained stable enough for long enough that the first apes could appear in Africa, twenty-five million years ago, the first hominids seven million years ago and our frightened, brilliant Homo sapiens a mere 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>• That your genes managed to pass safely through an unbroken 10,000-generation chain, despite the very best efforts of cyclones, predators and a constant barrage of viruses.</p>
<p>• That an average, fertile woman will have 100,000 eggs, and a man will produce a trillion sperm, each of these very different, but that — nevertheless — you have managed to emerge from the options as you are.</p>
<p>• That there are days of balmy sunshine and lemons, that there are olives, figs and hazelnuts.</p>
<p>• That this moment exists within a 13.799±0.021 billion-year span of cosmic time.</p>
<p>• And to all this, as they used to in the churches, one might cry (or whisper): Hallelujah!</p>

<p>There is enough in science to give birth to twenty religions — so much to worship, to be awed by and to be consoled through. How poor the old religions were by comparison, how paltry an invention a god is next to the mysterium tremendum of dark matter, string theory or quantum wave functions. The curse of modernity is not to have invented science; it’s not yet to have understood all that one might do with it.</p>
