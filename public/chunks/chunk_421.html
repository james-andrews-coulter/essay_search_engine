        <h2>Bourgeois Respectability</h2>
<p>Since the middle of the 17th century, starting in the Netherlands and then expanding around the continent, the educated middle classes of Europe have aspired to an ideal of sobriety and decency that has been captured by the term ‘bourgeois respectability’. Lawyers, doctors, traders and professionals of every kind have tried to distinguish themselves from the perceived decadence of aristocrats on the one hand and the permissiveness and chaos of the working classes on the other. To be a respectable bourgeois has meant having a tidy house, going to bed early, reading serious books, taking long bracing walks in cold air, teaching one’s children manners, dressing well but unostentatiously and harbouring a fierce hatred of public disorder. But more than such outward details, it has also meant keeping a close eye on one’s passions, never giving way to impulse or appetite, following the rules and obeying the moral code set by one’s society. It means taking an extraordinary interest in maintaining an unsullied reputation and in trusting in the rectitude of public life, especially in the opinions set out by significant figures in the newspapers. At the funeral of a respectable bourgeois, one of the chief points of praise might be that the deceased led an exemplary, upright existence – and was supremely well thought of by the entire community.</p>
<p>It is easy to mock, but that would be to miss out on the charms of bourgeois life and the substantial achievements it has produced. It is profoundly gratifying to have a neat laundry cupboard, carefully ironed clothes and a well-arranged kitchen; to have a good name among a wide range of polite and hard-working friends and to gather at dinner time around well-prepared and nutritious meals; to have enough but not too much money – and to spend it in carefully judged amounts on objects and projects of lasting value.</p>
<p>In Clemens Bewer’s portrait of the lawyer and civic official Johann Janssen and his family, painted in Aachen during Germany’s 19th-century middle-class ascendancy, we find a celebration of the bourgeois ethos. Johann stares out in a quiet but resolute way at the viewer; this is a man sure to have sensible opinions on all legal and financial matters: he might make an excellent godfather and would know how to recommend the purchase of the right kind of solid and well-crafted dining chairs. At the end of a particularly long, hot summer day, he might take off his cravat and relax in the garden with a very small glass of locally sourced Riesling. His wife, Magdalena, looks after the children. She appears timid, sensible and entirely fulfilled by domestic tasks. The children would likely know to say please and thank you. The little one (holding her mother’s hand) might be the butt of family jokes because of her habit of sometimes speaking out of turn – but by the time she turns six, these kinks will have been ironed out, and she will look forward to following her mother in heartfelt domestic devotion and good behaviour.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, bourgeois respectability is – naturally – entirely incompatible with failure. One cannot be both a respectable bourgeois and involved in a scandal, both a bourgeois and a divorcee, both a bourgeois and mentally unwell or both a bourgeois and bankrupt. Nor in the bourgeois worldview is there much room for redemption; one wouldn’t work quite so hard at keeping up appearances if it were really possible to pick oneself up from a fall and begin afresh. There are codes of responsibility and accountability that cannot be bypassed. Johann Janssen would have studiously avoided us if we had failed.</p>
<p>What, then, can happen to the shamed bourgeois, exiled from the garden of respectable existence?</p>
<p>Traditionally, there has been one refuge – what has been termed ‘bohemia’. Bohemia is the opposite of, but also the logical correlate to, the bourgeois realm. In the eyes of the bourgeois, bohemia embodies everything there is to be scared about. The worst that could happen to one’s child, worse than death perhaps, is that they should end up living as a bohemian, in an attic somewhere at the top of a building on the bad side of town, aspiring to write novels or plays or paint pictures, engaged to an actor, wearing unironed clothes and eating food without cutlery or even a plate. Paintings of bohemian life produced around the same time as Janssen’s family portrait were meant to strike terror into bourgeois hearts – and they did.</p>

<p>Contemplating these two opposing poles, we might find ourselves not overly enamoured of either. We might be put off by the narrowness and moralism of bourgeois life, but also frightened by the mess and discomforts of bohemia.</p>
<p>In the wake of failure, however, we would do well to hang on to the better sides of both philosophies – while leaving out the problematic ones. There is much to learn from either side; from bohemia, we gain a necessary scepticism towards public opinion, we learn not to give too much of a damn what the neighbours think and are invited to take our own ideas and inclinations more seriously – and we also learn not to equate a bad reputation with inherent shamefulness. The bohemians allow us to believe that we might fall short of society’s ideals of decency and yet, at the same time, continue to have the right to live. Our name might be an object of suspicion among lawyers and doctors, but we might still have one or two things to contribute.</p>
<p>At the same time, from the bourgeois, we can pick up a due appreciation of order and domesticity. We can learn to take pride in a well-kept home in spite of having chaotic inner feelings and a complicated private life. Indeed, it’s precisely because of these areas of confusion that we especially esteem a tidy cupboard and a well-laid table.</p>
<p>After failure, we might not be accepted back into the bourgeois circle – but we are at least provided with a moment to reflect upon both the achievements and the limitations of this dominant, now-triumphant approach to life. Going forward, we can instead aspire to hold on to a carefully edited mixture of bourgeois and bohemian virtues.</p>
