        <h3>2 Necessity</h3>
<p>Modernity is founded on the notion that we can change our circumstances through willpower and ingenuity. We can divert rivers, transform fortunes, invent miraculous machinery or start new lives on other continents.</p>
<p>But imagine for a moment a tree in autumn, a large tree, an oak or an aspen. It might be late October in a mild year. For a long time, the leaves held out, but now they are properly turning, a tell-tale silvery grey or ochre tinged with auburn. Within a few weeks and one or two vicious storms from the east, they will be gone, 200,000 of them blown around the forest floor, where millipedes, maggots, slime moulds, earthworms and bacteria are waiting to decompose them into primal mulch. Nothing can stop the melancholy process. All summer, the leaves protected us, filtering the harshness of the bright sunlight and casting gentle crisscross patterns as dusk fell. In spring, the leaves’ appearance was a symbol of hope and new beginnings. Now the air smells of death and decay. Our lives are no less subject to the laws of nature than are trees. We, too, are born, develop and must die. There are autumns in our years that nothing can protect us from.</p>
<p>But by contemplating the ineluctable processes of growth and decay in nature, we may come to accept more serenely all that we will have to give up and see taken from us with time. There are laws of nature that we can’t resist, that no amount of machinery or eloquence or money or power will overcome. An emperor and a tycoon are as vulnerable as a tramp before the mechanisms of the natural world, who will grind each one of us back down to our cellular origins. It could sound merely tragic, but there is relief from the manic assertiveness of our egos to be found in the grand spectacles of nature. The majestic trees render what might have been a mere humiliation into a call for a noble surrender before an awe-inspiring adversary.</p>
<p>In 1853, the American painter George Inness received a letter from the president of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company, who was proud of a new line that he and his team had cut through pristine nature to connect up Buffalo with New Jersey. He asked Inness to emphasise the sweep of the railway track and the scale of the roundhouse. But Inness wasn’t so sure of these priorities. He was very fond of trees — their stature and their elegance, but most importantly, their philosophical wisdom. Which is why, when he came to paint The Lackawanna Valley (1855), he included so many incongruous tree stumps in the foreground of his picture. A civilisation that was more excited about the arrival of a train than the end of nature had forgotten its priorities. It was also a civilisation steered by people at risk of forgetting that they too were still subject to natural laws, that even if they could now reach town in a few hours to buy a hat or transport a wagon of coal, they could not escape the limitations imposed on all living things. It was no surprise that those trees had been so impatiently cut down. They had been speaking too loudly to some rather vain railway men of the vanity of all things.</p>
