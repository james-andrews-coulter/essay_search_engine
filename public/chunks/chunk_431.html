        <h3>— Remember universal sin</h3>
<p>In the wake of failure, we are likely to feel intolerably guilty and ashamed, and suicidal thoughts may be at their height. In order to quell these, it is important to stress a fact that is unfashionable, but that has been considered throughout this book: that messing up is an intrinsic feature of our make-up. For Catholics, this proclivity was once classed under the title of ‘original sin’ (see page 33). According to St Augustine’s explanation, we are all the descendants of Adam and Eve – those two early transgressors from God’s laws – and therefore indelibly tainted with a temptation to do wrong. Sinning is not some individual freakish occurrence; it is what our species is hard-wired to do.</p>
<p>We don’t need to believe in the Biblical truth of this concept to recognise its applicability at moments of crushing self-blame: seeing ourselves as belonging to a species that continually messes up helps to alleviate the devastating shame that can render true atonement impossible. We can chastise ourselves, but before we give way to an impulse to harm ourselves, we should remember that what has befallen us fits into a wider scenario of human frailty. We are still, in the end, bad children – not monsters.</p>
