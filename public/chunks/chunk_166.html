        <h2>14.The Vulnerability of Perfection to Emotional Troubles</h2>
<p>The tourist industry spends a lot of time assuring us that the more money we spend, the happier we will be.</p>
<p>The equation often seems deeply convincing – and, sometimes, if resources allow, we do as we’ve been told. We select a truly stunning location right on the ocean or in a fashionable district that used to be full of factories and is now dotted with stylish boutiques. The hotel has very nice bedside lamps, fine art on the walls and a luxurious marble bathroom. The service is impeccable. We secure a succession of tables at well-reviewed restaurants. We arrange a sleek car to meet us at the airport. There are endless attractions for the children. We pay for a tennis teacher. We feel deeply fortunate: we are going to have the holiday of a lifetime.</p>
<p>But amidst all this expenditure, we’re liable to have neglected a crucial component of human contentment. All capacity for satisfaction depends first and foremost upon emotional well-being. The slightest psychological disturbance can destroy the benefits of a multi-billion-dollar hotel and chauffeured automobile. If our partner makes a snide comment, it won’t matter how celebrated the homard au champagne happens to be; the delicate richness of its flavour will count for very little when we’ve been the victim of a sarcastic remark about our career potential. A grumpy thirteen-year-old child can single-handedly negate the efforts of an entire team of gardeners or museum curators. Or if the person we are with won’t have sex with us in the way we really want, it will be no consolation that some small tubes of conditioner in the vicinity have been personally selected by Donatella Versace or that a handmade Belgian chocolate truffle was placed on the pillow into which we now feel like weeping deeply.</p>
<p>Regarded from an immense, impersonal distance, these are comic eventualities; close up they feel more like tragedies. This isn’t an argument against luxury – just an analysis of its limitations. The same sorrows might easily come our way on a shoestring budget. We’re not encountering the irrelevance of spending a great deal of money on travel: only the centrality and primacy of emotional satisfaction within the total economy of happiness.</p>
