        <h4>6. How to Make a Home When You’re Not at Home</h4>
<p>How to make yourself at home when you’ve got no home: tramps asleep on the Embankment, London, 1930s.</p>
<p>Home alone?</p>
<p>Where are you reading this? Are you nestled on a sofa in front of the fire? Are you perched at the kitchen table? Are you in bed? Are you in a garden, in the sun? Or are you in
  the bath? As you read this, are you at home, on your own? As I write it, am I?</p>
<p>In this book we’ve explored several different ways of making oneself at home. We’ve looked at building homes, furnishing them, decorating them, collecting them, and keeping them. We
  started with the idea that home should mean a secure, ordered, beautiful and personal refuge from the world. Along the way we have discovered that home can be insecure, disorderly, ugly,
  impersonal, and hard work.</p>
<p>But imagine if your home was taken away. You would miss something. What would you miss the most? The cooking and the cleaning? Your bric-a-brac? The tasteful surroundings? The comfortable
  furniture? The building you live in? I suspect it would be none of these things per se but, rather, the very sense of quiet refuge that a child’s drawing of a house brings to mind. If
  there’s one thing we assume about home it is that it must be private.</p>
<p>‘The house protects the dreamer,’ wrote Gaston Bachelard, ‘the house allows one to dream in peace,’1 for after all, it is
  when we are asleep, unconscious to threat, that we are at our most vulnerable. All the paraphernalia of home, from a protective roof to the miniature stockades of furniture and objects, from
  calming décor to an orderly sense of hygiene, are there to protect us as we dream, by sheltering us as we sleep.</p>
<p>The assumption that the home must provide privacy is one that has underpinned most of the ideal homes in this book, from Bachelard’s turreted dreamhouse to the glazed bathroom of Le
  Corbusier’s machine for living in (presumably not overlooked by neighbours); from Mario Praz’s resonance chambers of the soul to the treasure houses of Danny Miller to the ordered
  domestic enterprise of Mrs Beeton. In all of them, the house and the self are imagined as one.</p>
<p>Down and out in 1984</p>
<p>If you want to understand just how fundamental privacy is to our concept of home, it’s worth reading George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984. The story begins
  with our antihero, Winston Smith, hunting around his apartment for a spot in which he can escape the all-seeing electronic eye of Big Brother, brought into his home via a prophetic version of the
  television that could both receive and transmit images:</p>
<p>There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire
      was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live – did live, from
      habit that became instinct – in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.2</p>
<p>The point is a simple but chilling one: you can have a house, you can furnish it with whatever you like, and fill it with anything you fancy; you can paint the walls any colour
  you want, and keep it as messy as you desire, but if it’s not private, you won’t really be able to make yourself at home there.</p>
<p>Orwell knew from personal experience what it was like to live without privacy. In 1933 he spent several months Down and Out in Paris and London. In Paris, he worked as a
  plongeur, washing up in the restaurant of a luxury hotel. In London, he lived on the street, sleeping in hostels at night, and wandering the city aimlessly by day. There were many
  disadvantages, he discovered, about being down and out, but chief among them was the lack of any sense of privacy: his friend Paddy, another London tramp, described vividly an attempt to sleep on
  the street itself:</p>
<p>You got to be on your bench by eight o’clock, because dere ain’t too many benches and sometimes dey’re all taken. And you got to try to get to sleep at
      once. ’Tis too cold to sleep much after twelve o’clock, an’ de police turns you off at four in de mornin’. It ain’t easy to sleep, dough, wid dem bloody trams
      flyin’ past your head all de time, an’ dem sky-signs across de river flickin’ on an’ off in your eyes.3</p>
<p>It was only when he terminated his experience as a tramp, and returned to a state of privacy, that Orwell realized what he’d been missing.</p>
<p>Privacy is a privilege</p>
<p>In all the homes we’ve rummaged through in this book, there have been people who have had privacy and people who have not. Mrs Beeton’s servants would not have had
  rooms of their own; and in the elegant chateaux of Ancien Régime France, footmen were expected to sleep at the foot of their masters’ curtained beds. The Wunderkammer
  was a private space kept tightly under the prince’s lock and key: everyone else milled around in the great hall, or sat together around the fire in their one-room huts.</p>
<p>Privacy has always been a scarce and costly resource, and for millions of us, it is still an unaffordable luxury. You might be sharing a single room with your whole family in a tiny tenement or
  crammed into a one-room hut in Nairobi, or Mumbai, where Kibera and Dharavi, with populations of 2,000 and 5,000 per hectare respectively, form the most crowded concentrations of humankind on the
  planet.</p>
<p>You might be a maid or a driver in domestic service, looking after someone else’s house to earn enough to keep your own. Like Mrs Beeton’s dutiful domestics, you will rise before
  your mistress, and your time will be subjected to her whim. While you tend her home, yours will be a small cupboard hidden round the back of the kitchen.</p>
<p>You may be a construction worker in the Gulf, a factory operative in China, or a migrant farm worker in England. You will sleep in a dormitory, segregated by sex, woken by a bell, dressed in
  identical uniforms, fed breakfast in a canteen, and bussed to work on a job you never get paid quite enough to leave.</p>
<p>Perhaps you never made it to the dorm. You might be lying there, reading this, on the street. You are reading, perhaps, because you know it will be dangerous to go to sleep in public, or to keep
  your patch next to the ventilator blowing warm air out onto the pavement from some hotel or office building.</p>
<p>There are millions of us who have to learn how to make ourselves at home without having a home.</p>
<p>The architect Mark Pimlott has recorded the ways in which people inhabit the subways that run underneath Toronto in Canada.4 These are vast, endless
  interiors, but people have found ways of using the microgeographies within them to make themselves at home. They lay out toys or sunglasses or woolly hats for sale on sheets that can readily be
  bundled up and hurried away, on passageways where they know they’ll get a good view of the approaching police. They know how to corner corners for sleeping in that will be out of sight of the
  security cameras.</p>
<p>It’s an endless war of attrition. Over the past two decades writers like Mike Davies have recorded all the weapons the authorities use to keep the homeless from finding a home: from seats
  at bus stops that are too narrow to lie on without falling off, to medieval-looking spikes built into pavement.5 All it means, of course, is that
  people have to become more and more ingenious in beating the system at its own game.</p>
<p>In Bangkok in Thailand a recent study by the interior designer Nuttinee Karnchanaporn has brought to light an invisible zone, 150 centimetres wide, that runs in front of the buildings on most
  streets. This zone is neither public space nor is it private, for while it belongs to the owners of the buildings behind it, it may not be built upon. That is, this ambiguous zone may not be built
  upon permanently.</p>
<p>But there is nothing to say that is may not be occupied temporarily; and so, each day, from nine in the morning until, say, six in the evening, it is used as a shop front, on which plastic
  buckets, motorcycle parts, underpants and socks, or handbags are stacked up on display. At 6 p.m. the shopkeepers clear them away and roll down their shutters; and a new set of people arrives, with
  plastic seats and tables, braziers, torches, and the smells and noises of street food. By midnight, these too have disappeared, and a new set of people have spread out their mats on the step, to
  lay down to sleep. At 6 a.m. the next day, they roll up their mats, and the cycle begins again. They will be back again the next day.</p>
<p>Living on the street isn’t some evil aberration of city life, as many leftwing economists argue it to be. It is city life. Rightwing economists talk about the trickle-down effect,
  but any citizen of any developing city will tell you the reverse happens too: wealth trickles up from the informal microeconomies of slum, bazaar and favela to the mall, the apartment complex and
  the art gallery; and the two worlds are interdependent. Often, those who have had to make themselves a home without having one have been viewed as the city’s problem, but in many places, they
  are its economic bedrock. Often people have argued that they should be tidied away, out of sight and out of mind; but of all the inhabitants of cities, they have the right, and the need, to be
  treated as its citizens. What is more, they have a great deal to teach the rest of us about how to live in them.</p>
<p>What’s so good about privacy anyway?</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was reading a book about economic development in the Third World whose title I can no longer remember. All I recall is an image that particularly struck me.
  It was a photograph showing five children asleep in a bed in a one-bedroom hut. Under the photograph was a caption: ‘Soon,’ it said, ‘we will be able to make this a thing of the
  past.’ Under this caption was another caption: ‘Which of these is more obscene: the scene in the photograph, or the caption?’</p>
<p>After all, what is so good about being on one’s own in the first place?</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the slums of London’s East End were cleared, and their inhabitants moved out to new, detached homes in new towns and suburbs. They were given homes of which
  they could only previously have dreamt: stout brick houses, with gardens and gates; modern utility furniture; labour-saving kitchens, and all the rest of it. The move was heralded as one of the
  great leaps forward of postwar social democracy.</p>
<p>In 1957, Michael Young and Peter Willmott, two of the sociologists who had been involved in this rehousing project, published a study of what had happened, comparing lives in one of the new
  towns in Essex with those of the people they had left behind in London.</p>
<p>Entitled Family and Kinship in East London,6 their publication didn’t come up with the answer the authorities had been hoping for.
  Far from praising the order, the convenience, and the privacy of their new homes, the tenants of the new towns complained of one thing above all: loneliness. They had been brought up on the street,
  in and out of one another’s houses, sharing everything, living in public. Now all of that had been taken away, and they – particularly women, left alone in their spacious, stout,
  semi-detached houses during the day – felt isolated.</p>
<p>It’s a story that has been told time and time again. We have lived for so long with the association between privacy and privilege that we have grown to assume that being separated from
  other people is a universal, desirable and necessary good; but just as often, studies have shown that people would rather put up with the inconvenience of being together, rather than luxuriate in
  being alone.</p>
<p>It’s not just an issue for the poor. We have been living, over the last twenty years or so, in an unprecedented and, to be frank, unanticipated revival of public life. Not only do the
  majority of people in the world now live in cities; those cities themselves – or at least the ways in which we imagine them – have transformed completely.</p>
<p>Ask someone in the 1960s what the ideal home and the ideal city would be, and it would most likely have been a prairie house in Frank Lloyd Wright’s leafy suburb of Oak Park: a landscape
  of suburban homes, set amid quiet greensward, within easy driving distance of the mall, the country club, and the business park. The digital revolution, it was widely predicted, would complete this
  utopia. There would be no need for cities any more if we could all stay in touch online. There would be no need for shops any more, since everything could be purchased on the computer. In fact, by
  2015, none of us would need to go out in public at all.</p>
<p>But it didn’t happen, and now the sign of success is as likely to be a loft in Tribeca, or a house in Knightsbridge, or a flat on top of a shopping mall in Bandra as it is to be a country
  pile on the golf course. The most expensive house in the world, belonging to Mukesh Ambani, the world’s fourth richest man, isn’t a palace in a park. It’s a thirty storey tower in
  the centre of Mumbai. The first six floors are, apparently, devoted to that perennial urban problem, parking. There are, reputedly, 600 staff, three helipads, and a health centre. A private home in
  any commonly understood sense of the word this is not.</p>
<p>New urban homes are no longer designed for the cosy verities of 1950s family life. Very often, Manhattan apartments are designed without kitchens, for example. It is assumed that you’ll be
  eating out every day. Why cook, after all, when hundreds of Michelin-starred chefs could do it for you, in any cuisine you could desire?</p>
<p>Beyond the front door, be it sipping a coffee in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, or cruising the strip in Vegas, or joining the crowds at the Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai, people are, despite the
  car, despite the internet, coming together – not just to drink coffee, or eat, or work, or look at art; but to watch the people go by, to join a crowd, to be in public, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the street was merely the way home and the only people who lingered there were those who couldn’t afford to go anywhere else. Things have changed. We are all down and out
  in Paris and London now, and everywhere else, and what is more, we have chosen to be.</p>
<p>Big Sister Is Watching You: domestic surveillance before the internet.</p>
<p>We’re all living under the eye of Big Brother, too. The digital revolution seemed to promise that we could cocoon ourselves away from the public sphere; but it has in fact had the reverse
  effect. Mobile computing, ubiquitous broadband and our obsession with social media have all ensured that the public realm intrudes into the private inner sanctums of home all of the time.</p>
<p>As we withdraw to our drawing rooms after dinner, TV screens present us with the latest atrocity, natural disaster, or cultural spectacle. We’ve already broadcast our meal on Instagram,
  shared who we are eating with on Facebook, and what we think about it (in a well turned 140-character apophthegm) on Twitter.</p>
<p>And that’s just the broadcasting we’re doing on purpose. At the same time, our phones are pushing out data about our domestic lives that we generate inadvertently. The supermarket
  store-card informs the supermarket about the contents of our fridge; and the modem the media company about what we’re looking at and who we are speaking to.</p>
<p>It all makes Orwell’s Big Brother, and the CIA and KGB and MI5 and Stasi on which it was based, seem rather quaint and amateurish. It’s not just the homeless, the poor, the
  disadvantaged who make homes without privacy these days: it’s all of us. Perhaps those millions of people out there on the street can teach us something we need to know.</p>
<p>Being at home in public</p>
<p>I asked if you were at home, alone, as you were reading this, and for you to ask yourselves whether I was, too, as I wrote.</p>
<p>I’m not, and neither, I suspect, are you.</p>
<p>More likely, we are sitting in a cafe, or standing in a queue. I have written sections of this book with my laptop perched on my knees as I wait for a haircut in the barber, at a table on the
  train, and in a public library. How, then, when I have to write, or when you pick up the book to read, do we make ourselves at home?</p>
<p>Making a home might involve the ways in which people learn how to live together in flats or tenements, or dormitories in buildings old or new, borrowed or bought, rubbing away the sharp corners
  of masonry left behind by the previous generations for whom these structures were designed.</p>
<p>Home might be found in the ways in which we rearrange the chairs, or pull together the tables in a restaurant to accommodate an unexpected guest, or in the old sofa we pick up from a skip on the
  pavement, and carry into our new and empty home.</p>
<p>It might be made of scenery we don’t even need to create: a certain walk through the city to work, or a seat in the park in the sun, just before the shadows slide round in the afternoon.
  It might be about finding a spot in the street where there’s free Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Or it might involve the old trick of carrying home with you: putting the family photos on the desk at work, the girlie calendar on the workshop wall, or the furry dice in the windscreen, or the
  way in which, like an elderly couple on the train, we spread a picnic on the table.</p>
<p>It might be about wiping a table in a cafe as we sit down, or clearing the snow on the pavement in front of your front door, helping to repair your neighbour’s fence, or throwing a piece
  of litter in the bin as you walk by.</p>
<p>It might be something even less tangible. Undertaking research into domestic lives in Glasgow in the 1980s, the anthropologists Moira Munro and Ruth Madigan found that housewives enjoyed little
  more privacy than the tramps of Orwell’s London, the street people of Karnchanaporn’s Bangkok or Pimlott’s Toronto.</p>
<p>After all, they were living in houses that belonged to other people: financially, usually, to their husbands, socially to their children. What was to Dad and the kids a place of relaxation was
  to the women who looked after it all day a place of work. Although they were at home, they were not, as we understand it, at home.</p>
<p>And yet these women, Munro and Madigan found, had found ways to make themselves spaces that were private, even in rooms full of people:</p>
<p>They accepted other people’s choice of television programme because they were only half watching, while cooking or doing the ironing. They could distance themselves
      from a conversation . . . by engaging with small domestic tasks . . . this ‘busyness’ creates a space, without the very pointed separation that would be indicated by deliberately
      leaving the room.7</p>
<p>They created, quietly and subtly, a bubble of privacy around them that could appear and disappear in seconds, in time.</p>
<p>George Orwell’s friend Paddy knew he had to be on the benches of the Embankment early if he was going to get a night’s sleep. The homeless who occupy the subways in Toronto know that
  they will be moved on by the police – and, indeed, the strategy of the police is to move them on to prevent their footholds becoming customary or in any way permanent. The inhabitants of the
  150-centimetre city of Bangkok share what passes for their homes with restaurants, shopfronts and passers-by: just not at the same time.</p>
<p>For a long time the idea of home has been burdened with the notion of privacy. Nowadays, however, not only is this an impossible, unaffordable ideal for many, it is also the denial of an
  opportunity: to connect with the people around us. That is not to say that privacy is neither necessary nor possible, only to point out that perhaps we could more productively look for it at
  particular times, rather than searching for it in places like isolated suburbs, detached houses, and rooms with locks on the doors.</p>
<p>Home is not necessarily made of bricks and mortar, nor of furniture or other possessions, nor cushions or curtains. It is not a place or a thing. Home is a sensibility, a state of mind peculiar
  to each of us, something we must make for ourselves in the moments we can.</p>
