        <h2>Tahiti &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>We have, as a species, always had a strong hunch that paradise must exist and one or two settled ideas of what it might be like when we get there: warm, dotted with palm trees, rich in succulent fruits, teeming with docile animals and inhabited by a few highly welcoming and kindly people. Medieval writers summoned the place in their imaginations, Renaissance painters depicted it in their art – and by the 16th century, sailors began to head out across the oceans to find it in reality. It was at points variously identified with the coastline of Panama, the smaller Windward Islands and the north of Madagascar, but the eventual conclusion was that if paradise was located anywhere on Earth, it had to be on a large piece of basalt rock sticking out of the South Pacific 5,700 kilometres east of Australia, originally known as Otaheite and now commonly referred to as Tahiti.</p>
<p>When Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, the first Frenchman to navigate the globe and explore the island, arrived with his two ships on the north-eastern coast at Hitiaa O Te Ra on 2nd April 1768, he was in no doubt as to what he had found. He described a peaceable people living on a diet of tropical fruits and fish in immaculate thatched villages near the beaches. They dressed in grass skirts and seashell necklaces, worshipped nature and the sky, were loving, athletic and graceful, and seemed to know no fear or bitterness. They had never read a book or done mathematics but seemed none the poorer for it. After ten idyllic days, Bougainville renamed the place New Cythera, after the Greek island that had in mythology been home to Aphrodite, goddess of love. In 1788, when a British expedition spent five months exploring the fruit trees of Tahiti, it was not altogether surprising that some of the sailors opted to mutiny from their ship, HMS Bounty, rather than head back up to the English Channel. Stories of Tahiti’s natural majesty filtered back to Europe and inflamed public imagination. Despite Tahiti’s lack of wealth and technological sophistication, it put modernity firmly to shame, for its people seemed to know something that had eluded the cleverest minds in Paris and London: how to be content.</p>
<p>So even now we may head to Charles de Gaulle airport, fly twelve hours to LAX, layover for four hours, then take a nine-hour flight to Fa’a’ā International Airport, 15,700 kilometres away. ‘Welcome to Paradise’, a sign announces – not hubristically – in the corridor after customs. It is Tahiti’s glory as well as its curse to have to stand in for a central piece of our imaginations.</p>
<p>There is enough of what Bougainville saw still in existence to ensure that we will feel we have come to the right place – the brightness of the skies on sunny mornings, the succulence of the fruits, the radiance of the flowers, the beauty of the people – now enhanced by the seven pools, five restaurants, steam rooms, yoga centre and thatched cabins of the InterContinental Tahiti Resort &amp; Spa, nestled in a cove by the airport.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, melancholy may descend in the tropics when it starts to rain, when the hotel guests rush in off the beach with sodden towels and take shelter in the lounge, when the manager smiles and assures everyone that it will soon pass and when we sit reading David Sweetman’s definitive biography of Paul Gauguin (who came in 1891 and gave everyone syphilis), or Hilary Spurling’s biography of Henri Matisse (who came in 1930 and got bored and sad in his room in the now demolished Hôtel Stuart, a concrete block overlooking the waterfront in the capital, Papeete).</p>
<p>Gauguin ascribed all the island’s difficulties to the influence of early 19th-century missionaries. They had made everyone sour; they had led the Tahitians to feel guilty about sex; they had encouraged the women to cover their breasts; they had made the children sing hymns.</p>
<p>Matisse couldn’t make sense of his mood. He lacked for nothing. He went for walks by the beach. He tried out a canoe. Yet he felt inadequate to such splendour. His difficult life hitherto hadn’t prepared him for such felicity. What was he to do in paradise? He certainly couldn’t turn it into art. It was like trying to stare at the sun. He made a few desultory attempts to sketch some flowers on his balcony and some trees by a lagoon, but he was quickly overwhelmed. Only much later, after he had returned to Europe, after a great deal more suffering had descended on him, after the Second World War, after he had developed duodenal cancer and lost the ability to walk, did the lost beauty start to haunt him: the turquoise sea, the madrepores, the Polynesian ground doves, the manta rays and giant turtles. Paradise could be allowed into the imagination only as a subject of longing, finding eventual form in an abstract precis of happiness finished shortly before his death that he called Memory of Oceania.</p>
<p>Paradise may simply not suit our nature. We have too much anxiety thrumming through our veins. We get restless, we listen to serpents, we are serpents ourselves, ready to poison and disobey. We bring ‘ourselves’ to Arcadia; that is, all our fretfulness, regret, dissatisfaction, cluelessness and suppressed rage. Those British mutineers ended up killing one another, inciting tribal warfare and, in some cases, going mad. Gauguin tried to slit his throat. It is in paradise that we may feel our inadequacies and melancholy most severely.</p>
