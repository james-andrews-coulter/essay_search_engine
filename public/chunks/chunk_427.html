            <h3>Jobs</h3>
<p>After a downfall, what are we to do with ourselves workwise? If we can get another job, what sort of job should it be?</p>
<p>Usually, in even the noblest minds and most virtuous professions, work is seldom without a degree of vanity. A doctor wants to help their patients, for sure, but they are also quietly pleased when they are noticed doing so by prestigious eyes. A charity worker is concerned with the war-torn country they are helping, but they are forthright when asking for a raise as well. Most jobs allow workers to engineer moments when they can be admired and acclaimed slightly more than would be warranted by the strict needs of the job itself.</p>
<p>This, of course, is impossible – and sickening – for those who have failed. When we have suffered a downfall, we see work not as a place to stand out, but instead to disappear. Hopes of personal glory are firmly behind us. What we want to be subsumed by is something very distinctive and very wise: problems far larger than our own. As failed people, we are likely to be in the market for the enormous problems of other people; we want to work long and hard at something very serious that leaves no room either for showing off or for thinking of ourselves. We need to find difficulties so urgent, so ghastly, so serious, so indisputably critical that we will – while attending to them – be able to forget who we are and what has happened to us. It really won’t matter that we were sacked or disgraced or humiliated when a house is on fire, when one of the patients in a hospice needs a defibrillator, when we have to get an ambulance up a hillside to rescue a stricken child, when we’re trying to alleviate malaria in an under-nourished population in a war-ravaged country or when we are assisting on a ward filled with people who are seeking to take their own lives.</p>
<p>Such work will leave us feeling exhausted, rocked to the core and sometimes traumatised – but what it will not do is remind us of what we have lost and how much fashionable society once respected us. Indeed, every day, it will only serve to highlight what we still have to appreciate. We may have destroyed our good name and be the laughing stock in our old community, but we can still lay claim to relative good health, our minds still function more or less and we have enough money for food and shelter. Our job can help us to pulverise the ego and provide round-the-clock opportunities for gratitude.</p>
<p>Our new kind of work should ideally also enable us to access a feeling that, in other circumstances, we would have lost entirely: the sense that we can make a positive difference to others’ lives. Of late, we might only have experienced our power to mess everything up. We will have been an exceptional problem to those around us: upsetting friends and family, letting down colleagues, shocking strangers. Our very presence has been offensive to so many. But thanks to a certain sort of job, we can – in a limited way – feel that we are the sort of person that others can call upon for help. It may be a relatively minor intervention, but we can bring water to a cancer patient in a hospice, teach a child how to do their times tables or calm down a suicidal patient in a clinic for troubled teenagers. It really doesn’t matter if the job pays very much and we certainly won’t care if anyone in the wider world knows that we’re doing it; it will offer something infinitely more important than prestige or material reward: a feeling that there’s a reason for us to keep existing.</p>
<p>We are used to career services that tend to the needs of the young. What we need is an alternative service specifically geared to the needs of the failed. Such a career service would take stock of our disaster and try to determine our particular areas of competence and interest. Then it would attempt to match us with an urgent societal problem commensurate in scale with our woes.</p>
<p>A supreme example of an inspiring career adjustment in the wake of failure lies in the life of the British Conservative politician and War Secretary John Profumo, who in June 1963 – at the age of 48 and after a hugely successful career in the military and in the senior ranks of government – had to resign after being caught in an affair with a 19-year-old model, Christine Keeler – an affair which had endangered national security and led him to lie to the Prime Minister, the security services and the House of Commons.</p>
<p>A more complete fall from grace had scarcely ever visited a British politician. Profumo had no hope of returning to his previous life. He was a national disgrace and the subject of taunts and mockery. Rotten eggs were thrown at his car. He had let lust blind him to his responsibilities to his family, his party and his country. For a few months he was entirely despondent. Then, in early 1964, seven months after his resignation, Profumo wrote a letter to Walter Birmingham, who ran Toynbee Hall, a centre for disadvantaged people in Whitechapel, one of the most economically depressed parts of East London. Profumo asked if he could possibly be of any help, even perhaps cleaning the toilets (this was a man who had, a year before, held one of the great offices of state). Birmingham had a noble heart and a keen sense of how people could turn their lives around, whether they were kids just out of prison or a disgraced Conservative minister. So he wrote back to Profumo and asked him to come and see him. The letter saved Profumo’s life. Suddenly, he had a mission to solve problems far larger and more desperate than his own.</p>
<p>The disgraced politician threw himself into his work. He did everything from cleaning to reforming the management structure of the organisation to raising funds for new initiatives. He became an exemplary employee – never complaining, never alluding to his past and treating everyone with exceptional grace and kindness. His ego had disappeared in the heat of his scandal. All he wished to do was serve. Paradoxically, so well did he serve, so uncomplaining was his approach, so uninterested was he in himself, that his example attracted notice from former friends and enemies in politics. In 1975, after multiple recommendations, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. In 1995, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a 70th birthday party at which she sat Profumo next to the Queen. When he died, the lawyer and social reformer Lord Longford remarked that he ‘felt more admiration [for Profumo] than [for] all the men I’ve known in my lifetime’.</p>
<p>A lesson we can all take from Profumo’s life is that he wisely did not attempt a ‘comeback.’ He understood that living quietly for a few years before attempting a return to politics would symbolise a refusal to understand his guilt and a rejection of the opportunities that his downfall had afforded for him: to overcome vanity and to open his heart to the needs of ordinary, desperate people that he had hitherto ignored.</p>
<p>After our own downfalls, we should bring some of Profumo’s humility and acumen to bear on our destroyed lives. We will need to ask ourselves where our particular passions happen to lie – and how we can connect them up with urgent real-world problems. The answers won’t always involve working with poverty in a capital city. Our vocation might be to help blind children to learn to read, or to assist recently arrived refugees, or to tend to elderly prisoners who have been released after serving lengthy terms for sex crimes.</p>
<p>However hard our eventual work will be, it will be doing us the greatest favour: it will show us that we still have a role to play and help us to see that our suffering is neither unique nor uniquely awful. We will hardly need to ask about salaries. Our chief enquiry in interviews will simply be: ‘How great is their pain? How can I help?’</p>
