        <h3>What makes life truly valuable</h3>
<p>Explores and appreciates the small pleasures found in everyday life.</p>
<p>So often, we exhaust ourselves and the planet in a search for very large pleasures, while all around us lies a wealth of small pleasures, which – if only we paid more attention – could daily bring us solace and joy at little cost and effort. But we need some encouragement to focus our gaze.</p>
<p>This is a book to guide us to the best of life’s small pleasures: everything from the distinctive delight of holding a child’s hand to the enjoyment of disagreeing with someone or the joy of the evening sky; an intriguing, evocative mix of small pleasures that will heighten our senses and return us to the world with new-found excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
