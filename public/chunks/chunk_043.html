        <h2>Photos &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>To those sensitive to melancholy, looking though an album of old photographs of ourselves is an especially poignant pastime.</p>
<p>A few pages in, there we are in a large colour portrait: a smiling five-year-old, pulling a gap-toothed smile, extremely proud of having just completed a drawing of a submarine and some very happy-looking fish. We’re wearing our favourite dungarees and our hair is unusually long. We’re also – if we can say it ourselves – very cute.</p>
<p>We may be moved at the sight of this little person, but also – probably – deeply saddened as well. How much of life’s suffering this tiny thing didn’t yet know! How much pain they still had ahead of them! They had no clue – that sunny afternoon in the garden of the old house, a few hours before it would have been time for a bowl of animal-shaped pasta and a strawberry yogurt for tea – what fate had in store. How little they could suspect of the divorce, the move to the smaller house, the bullying, the loneliness, the unrequited love, the guilty feelings around sex, the career mishaps, the trouble with their health, the realities of marriage, the financial anxiety, the romantic betrayals, the tetchiness, the ugliness of age, the persistent anxiety and fear and the troubles of child-raising … to start a list that is in no way comprehensive or even especially ghastly (it can get much, much worse).</p>
<p>We’re likely to realise, as we look at another photo of us attempting a cartwheel by a forest, that part of what keeps us going is the sheer fact of not knowing. We are kept alive by a brute biological appetite reliant on ignorance. But if we imagine being given the option of magically returning to being five again, knowing what we know now, we would most likely say a firm no. We aren’t actively looking forward to death – we haven’t got plans to end things prematurely – but we couldn’t really bear to have our entire life again. Too many of our years have been spent in pain of one kind or another. There have been a few moments of fun and achievement, but, essentially, the score sheet has been too mixed to warrant another whole go. It’s a melancholy realisation. Without our necessarily being fully aware of it, we don’t find a great deal of what happens to us tolerable. There are too many days lost to anxiety and aggravation, self-doubt and alarm, loneliness and longing. We hate our lives more than we perhaps usually acknowledge. We want to go back and hug that little child for all the difficulties heading their way. We want to cry at their joyful innocence in a world which will make them suffer a lot.</p>
<p>Even worse, this retrospective glance can make us question the future. Right now, we still retain certain hopes. We may be trying to make a new relationship work or devoting a lot of effort to a professional project. If the past is any indication, though, within a decade (if we’re lucky enough to have it), we’ll be looking at a photo of ourselves today with some of the same emotions as those we now feel looking back on the five-year-old version of ourselves. We’ll be seeing someone similarly naïve about what is to come, similarly innocent of difficulties, similarly overly excited given what is actually possible, given our nature and the conditions of life. Not only were we innocent in the past, but we are still fairly innocent about the future.</p>
<p>Many photos feel bittersweet; that is, not plain dreadful, but tinged with something difficult or shameful. Take a photo of us with our grandmother. We must be around nine. We loved spending time with her, helping her in her garden and laying out our toys in her front room. We also know that when adolescence came, we stopped going to see her. She seemed embarrassing and we imagined she couldn’t understand much of what we were feeling, though we never tried to explain. When she died, we hadn’t been to see her in over a year. We’re still cut up about it to this day, and ever more so as time passes.</p>
<p>Then there’s a shot of us with our first partner. We’d been lonely for so long and, finally, they’d taken us on. They were very kind to us – and obviously pretty young and fragile themselves. They look lovely, somewhere on the coast, with their hair blown about by a breeze, and their arm around us. We rented a little cabin and went for walks along the marshes. We rented some bikes the day before we left. Yet bitterness dogs us here too. After half a year or so, for reasons we still can’t really understand, we told them it was over – and did so rather horribly. We were too embarrassed to be kind. We hurt them badly through fear. From the evidence on the internet, they seem pretty happily married now. They must hate us a lot. Sometimes, late at night, we wish we could call them up and tell them (though it sounds a bit mad) that we still love them.</p>
<p>Then there’s a shot of us at university with a group of friends. It looks as though we’re having fun. There’s the guy whose name we can’t even remember who was always putting on funny accents and once almost crashed his mother’s car. There’s the gloomy, clever physicist we loved talking to. How little we made of those precious years! We should have been more honest about what we actually felt. We should have dared to be a genuine friend to the others.</p>
<p>We start to realise how much of life has been less than we would have hoped. We aren’t necessarily crying, but as we shut the photo album, we are one thing for sure: sad in the distinctive way we best call melancholy.</p>
