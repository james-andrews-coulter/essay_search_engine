        <h2>IVCommercialisation</h2>
<p>A complaint regularly aired around many careers is that, in order to succeed at them, there is no option but to ‘sell out’. It appears that we will inevitably face a choice between authenticity and penury on the one hand, and idiocy and wealth on the other. We are familiar with this complaint in the arts, of course. But the same dilemma shows up when an interesting restaurant seems unable to make a profit; when a specialist bread company goes into receivership; when a garden supply firm focusing on rare native plants can’t get a foothold in the market; when a sincere news site can’t turn a profit, or when an ethically based investment firm is doomed to operate on a tiny scale in comparison with its less high-minded competitors.</p>
<p>Behind the complaint lies a very understandable but ambitious yearning: that our most passionately held beliefs and enthusiasms should, relatively painlessly, and by virtue of their merits, become high priorities for others. Our instincts lead us to suppose that what we are convinced of should prove equally compelling to strangers.</p>
<p>Young children are particularly prone to this assumption. On meeting a new adult, they may enthusiastically suggest that they join them in playing a favourite game, perhaps brew something on the miniature kitchen stove, or impersonate one of their dolls, which shows how hard it is for a child to grasp how alien his or her pleasures might be to another person. Children aren’t silly; they are just highly attuned to their own natures and are convinced that others will share their tastes. In a naive but representative way, they illustrate an instinct that stays with us all of our lives: the supposition that others will and must be moved by what moves us; that their value systems are, or should be, like ours; and that what we love can automatically be what the world loves.</p>
<p>The reality is often humiliatingly and enragingly different. A novel that is filled with subtle character analyses and that takes inventive risks with plot structure might sell only modestly, while one that pits good against evil in a predictable way, relies on well-tried narrative tricks and arrives at an implausibly happy ending will dominate the bestseller lists. A high-street chain might do a fabulous trade in cut-price dark grey polyester-cotton socks, while a thoughtful, original brand involving striking colour combinations and materials ethically sourced from Peru will fail to find a market.</p>
<p>It is tempting to arrive at a despairing conclusion: that the economy is inherently devoted to delivering a personal affront to the better aspects of human nature. The truth is much less vindictive, but the tendency for the market to overlook or at least remain cool in relation to our more sincere and earnest efforts is nevertheless real – and founded on a raft of identifiable and stubborn forces in economic and psychological life.</p>
<p>One of the most basic of these forces is choice. It is in the nature of a growing, successful economy always to expand the range of choices offered to a consumer, and thereby, always to minimise the a priori claims of any one product or service. We can track the characteristic features of this development in relation to media. In 1952, a BBC radio broadcast of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony attracted an audience of five million listeners – approximately 16% of the UK’s adult population. Today, such a broadcast would claim a fraction of these numbers. What explains the difference is not – as some cultural pessimists might claim – that the UK population has over a few generations become less sensitive to the emotive force of German Romantic music; the fundamental difference is that today’s audience has many more options. In 1952, there were very few competing sources of entertainment. People listened en masse to the classical end of BBC radio because there was nothing much else to do. A producer who worked in the corporation had a great deal more authority than today’s equivalent, not on the basis of superior genius, but because his listeners had few viable alternatives. This, rather nicely, gave certain high-brow things more opportunity to be attended to; but it also meant that many substandard services and products could enjoy a far larger role than their intrinsic merit warranted.</p>
<p>We know from the study of certain natural habitats that in situations of abundant choice (the warm seas around the Seychelles, for example), attention goes towards members of the species that appear colourful, variegated and theatrical. Much the same holds true for companies amid the din and buzz of the human marketplace. What is brusquely called ‘selling out’ typically refers to a series of moves no more and no less sinister than the elaborate signalling to which all living things must submit in their efforts to be noticed. Amid plenty, products and services must throw their qualities into dramatic relief, puff out their virtues, sound more confident than they perhaps are, and lodge themselves in the minds of their distracted audiences with unabashed insistence. It is understandable if those who are committed to higher values may balk at such demands, resentfully condemning the pitilessness of an unfeasibly vulgar system.</p>
<p>There is another reason why modern audiences are likely to sidestep opportunities for high-minded consumption: because they are exhausted. Modern work demands a punishing amount from its participants. We typically return from our jobs in a state of depletion: frazzled, tired, bored, enervated, sad. In such a state, the products and services for which we will be in the mood have to be of a very particular cast. We may be too brutalised to care much about the suffering of others, or to think empathetically of unfortunates in faraway tea plantations or cotton fields. We may have endured too much tedium to stay patient with arguments that are intelligently reticent and studiously subtle. We may be too anxious to have the strength to explore the more sincere sections of our own minds. We may hate ourselves a bit too much to want to eat and drink only what is good for us. Our lives may be too lacking in meaning to concentrate only on what is meaningful. To counterbalance what has happened at work, we may instinctively gravitate towards what is excessively sweet, salty, distracting, easy, colourful, explosive, sexual and sentimental.</p>
<p>This collectively creates a vicious circle. What we consume ends up determining what we produce – and, in turn, the quality of jobs that are on offer. So long as we only have the emotional resources to consume at the more narcotic and compromised end of the market, we will only generate employment that is itself challenged in meaning and compromised in dignity – which will further increase our demand for lower-order goods and services. We seem hampered by our existing conditions of employment from properly developing the sort of temperaments that could strengthen the sincerity and seriousness of our appetites and so expand the range of meaningful and non-depleting jobs we could have access to.</p>
<p>The price we pay for a marketplace that refuses to support high-minded efforts is not just practical and economic; it is also at some level emotional. One of our greatest cravings is to be recognised and accepted for who we are. We long for careful, insightful appreciation of our characters and interests. This was, if things went tolerably well, a little like what happened to us in earliest childhood, when a kindly adult, through the quality of their love, spared us any requirement to impress or, as we might put it, to market ourselves. In those early years, we did not need assiduously to ‘sell’ who we were; we did not have to smile in exaggerated ways, sound happier than we were, put on seductive accents or compress what we had to say into memorable jingles. We could take our time, hesitate, whisper, be a little elusive and complex and as serious as we needed to be – sure that another would be there to find, decode and accept us. Everything we learnt of love ran counter to the mechanisms of commercialisation.</p>
<p>It is no wonder if we harbour within us a degree of instinctive revulsion against commercial strictures. The need not to sell ourselves aggressively was not just part of an earlier, simpler point in the history of the world (as scholars rightly point out); it was, more poignantly, also a moment in each of our personal histories, to which we may always long to return.</p>
