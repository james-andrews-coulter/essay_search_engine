        <h2>Failure Imagined</h2>
<p>We have been looking at how to understand and cope with actual failure: disgrace, scandal, bankruptcy, unemployment, mental illness, family separation, marital breakdown …</p>
<p>However, in considering the subject, we also need to acknowledge a curious phenomenon: that cases of actual failure only comprise a portion – and perhaps the smaller portion – of the nightmare that the topic of failure plunges us into. Most of the failure that ails us hasn’t happened yet – and may never. It is apprehended failure: a failure of what might occur; a feverish deduction from our worst forebodings. We have spent valuable time torturing ourselves with scenarios that didn’t come to pass. We have ruined some of the best days of our lives ruminating on catastrophes that in the end left us untouched. We have worried about the end of relationships that continued, we have panicked about money that didn’t run out, we have feared reputational ruin that didn’t visit us. We have wasted days by the sea on beautiful islands or in exciting foreign cities because in our minds, we were not able to be present at all, because we were rigid with terror, fearing the call of a journalist, a pained apology from a lover, an email from our boss, the collapse of our minds … We may have spent our lives outwardly free, while crouching in a cage of apprehension of our own making.</p>
<p>The fear of failure is every bit as serious and painful as failure itself. Just because an incident doesn’t happen in the three-dimensional world doesn’t mean that we can skirt its ravages. A calamity that is endlessly anticipated is in its way every bit as awful as a calamity that actually unfolds – with the added problem that fears tend to go on far longer than ‘real’ incidents. We might spend three decades ruminating on a fear of something that, if it really occurred, might only spoil a few years. Worries can be yet more destructive than the events they apprehend.</p>
<p>There are two ways of interpreting our fears of failure: that they are entirely made up and a consequence of inner emotional turmoil, or that they have some connection to true dangers but are wildly overblown and would be survivable even if they came to pass. Both cases deserve compassion and curiosity – as well as thorough responses and coping strategies.</p>
<p>What follows is a consideration of the subject, which takes anticipated failure every bit as seriously as its real-world cousin – and which proposes that, just like it, it can eventually be endured and borne … and even leave us alone every now and then to enjoy the view and a little more of our brief and precious lives.</p>
