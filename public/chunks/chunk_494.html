            <h2>Ritual</h2>
<p>Modern culture is very attached to the idea of doing things only once and then moving on to fresh experiences. Novelty and change are centrally prestigious notions; we’re eager to explore new places, ideas and opportunities. This attitude comes into particular focus around the status we accord to ‘the news’, a medium that fundamentally equates novelty with importance.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, we assume there could be nothing more ridiculous than repeating an old idea again and again. Repetition sounds boring and irksome, like the worst experiences of childhood education. But other cultures have taken a different and perhaps wiser view; they have had a high regard for repetition. They have created aesthetically compelling occasions where the same lesson has been rehearsed again and again. Across the globe and through time, it is particularly religions that have been concerned with getting people to repeat ideas. Zen Buddhists have looked at the moon every autumn and written poems in its honour on a set day; Jews will take time to appreciate spring according to a ritual requirement of their holy calendar; Catholics are required to ritually examine their consciences every Sunday; in Russia, orthodox ritual demanded that before a long journey, everyone would meditate briefly on the possibility of never seeing each other again.</p>
<p>What fired the religious devotion to ritual was the realisation that if the goal was to change minds and behaviour (and thereby change the world), once was never going to be enough.</p>
<p>In a secular age, the deep link between religion and ritual has served to cast the very concept of repetition into shadow. This is unfair. In the Utopia, the most important ideas would keep being reinforced via aesthetically compelling rituals. On a regular basis, we would be reminded of the importance of forgiveness, appreciation, self-knowledge and kindness. It’s not that we ever actively disagree with such ideas; we simply forget to act upon them in practice. We need rituals to ensure that we properly listen to the significance of all the old things we half-know already, but avoid properly putting into practice, nevertheless.</p>
