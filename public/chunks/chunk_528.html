            <h2>The Limits of Hard Work</h2>
<p>The Duc de La Rochefoucauld was a seventeenth-century French aristocrat who wrote one of the greatest books of all time, the Maxims, in a few weeks when he was in his early fifties.</p>
<p>The Maxims is an extremely slender book, composed of only around 500 wise and charming observations, rarely longer than 100 words – for instance: ‘If we had no faults we would not find so much enjoyment in seeing faults in others’, or ‘The world more often rewards the outward signs of merit than merit itself’.</p>
<p>Even more remarkably, writing the book did not cost La Rochefoucauld any great effort, as he briefly hints: ‘It often happens that things come into the mind in a more finished form than could have been achieved after great study.’ He wrote most of it during tea parties, and he confessed to being a very lazy person, only writing when the mood seized him; and though he never expected it to sell well, it garnered him immediate respect and enduring fame. Voltaire said it was the most important book in French literature, which still seems just about right as a verdict.</p>
<p>To the bourgeois imagination, this is a scandalous story: La Rochefoucauld didn’t put in long hours, he didn’t work very hard, and yet his little book has been selling well for more than 350 years.</p>
<p>This violates our cult of hard work, and our firm belief that huge and constant efforts are always at the root of success. We can’t bear the idea of the inspired dandy. It’s become standard to hear anyone who wishes to be seen as a good person emphasising how hard they work – as if the sheer quantity of time invested will guarantee the worth of what they are, so laboriously, doing.</p>
<p>We’ve become devoted to the notion that it is only procrastination that is holding us back – and that we would succeed if only we could force ourselves to work harder.</p>
<p>But there is a more disturbing thought that we are thereby keeping at bay: that perhaps simply working hard isn’t the decisive factor, that we might work for years and produce nothing good, or (on the other hand) sit around for decades and then – in a few weeks – do something that changes history. We fetishise the hours of labour to distract ourselves from a very awkward truth: that sheer hard work often isn’t enough and that, when talent is supreme, one can get away with a lot of ‘laziness’.</p>
