<p>When caricatures of old people seem not just tenacious but also inevitable – this is when we need to turn to history. But if we don’t idealize the past, are we really going to feel happier about growing older by learning that the ancient Sardinians hurled their elders off high cliffs, and roared with laughter when they fell onto the rocks below? Or that in remote parts of Japan adults used to eat old men once they’d reached a certain age? Perhaps the point of such grisly accounts is to make us appreciate that, with our heating allowance and free NHS prescriptions to look forward to (always assuming these survive), ours is going to be a pampered ageing, so we should shut up and quit complaining.</p>
<p>No: what history shows us is that attitudes towards old people can and have changed – even if not invariably for the better; there’s nothing immutable or ‘natural’ about them. The more we learn about the historical origins of ageism, the easier it is not to take it personally.</p>
<p>As Simone de Beauvoir pointed out, ‘a man’s [sic] ageing and his decline always takes place inside some given society.’ Looking back and elsewhere reveals how much our opinions and behaviour are shaped by the societies we live in and, even more, by their economies: what ends with a casual expression of ageism – ‘he’s showing his age’ – begins with economic anxieties. Understand this and you have a whole trunk of tools to help combat ageism.</p>
<p>No golden age</p>
<p>Certainly gerontophobia has a long history. Aristotle called old people small-minded, malicious and ungenerous. Plautus practically invented the stereotype of the dirty but impotent old man. Senecide – the killing of old people – was common practise in many cultures. The Hopi abandoned their old in specially built huts. The Samoans buried their elders alive, while the Nambikwara Indians have one word meaning young and beautiful, and another for both old and ugly.</p>
<p>In most traditional societies you were shown respect only as long as you were socially useful. There were practical reasons for this: as the historian David Hackett Fischer pointed out, in groups living close to the edge of subsistence, dependent old people were a heavy burden on their kin. Indeed senecide often exists side by side with infanticide.</p>
<p>Old and powerful</p>
<p>Preindustrial societies certainly weren’t all gerontocracies, where old people ruled. Still, old age, when it was much rarer than now, had a scarcity value and was a far more venerated state: age often conferred prestige and privileges, power and authority. In ancient Greece you couldn’t become a member of the jury until 50. The Roman Senate originated from the word senex, meaning aged. Between 1400 and 1600, the average age of the doges, who held the highest office in the Venetian republic, was 72.</p>
<p>Although early modern Europeans searched obsessively for the Fountain of Youth, the idea that older meant worse was foreign. In the seventeenth century men wore wigs powdered white because they wanted to look old. In eighteenth-century New England, people tried to make themselves seem older than they actually were by adding years to their real age, rather than subtracting them.</p>
<p>The big shift</p>
<p>But the nineteenth century saw the start of a profound change in the way old age was thought about: the idea that ageing was part of the human condition, with its inevitable limits, increasingly gave way to a conception of old age as a biomedical problem to which there might be a scientific solution.</p>
<p>This was reflected in changes to both customs and language. In seventeenth-century America the best seats in meeting houses were reserved for old people. Between 1770 and 1840 they lost those privileged seats, yielding them to the wealthy, and new laws forced them to retire at a fixed age. Before 1780 ‘fogey’ meant a wounded military veteran; by 1830 it had acquired the meaning it has today – a pejorative term for an old, hidebound person. Similarly ‘senile’ was transformed in the nineteenth century from a value-free adjective signifying old age to a medical term conveying the debilitations of old age, most often paired with ‘dementia’. ‘Codger’, ‘superannuated’ and eventually ‘geriatric’ joined them in the lexicon of contempt for the old.</p>
