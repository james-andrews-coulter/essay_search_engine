            <h3>¶ Faulty Walnut, The</h3>
<p>The phrase ‘the Faulty Walnut’ makes affectionate reference to the instrument that sits on top of our spinal cords, an organ that is hugely powerful, inventive, nimble, capable of astonishing calculation and conjecture and – at the same time – dangerously and pervasively flawed. Paradoxically, the way to greater lucidity is not to place ever deeper faith in our walnuts; it is to keep their misleading, exaggerated and deceptive nature constantly at the forefront of our thoughts. Wisdom begins with a recognition of certain of our fundamental inclinations to folly and blindness.</p>
<p>The walnut is marked by a range of stubborn defects that are dangerously hard to extirpate, let alone recognise in good time. It is prone to desiring and fearing without properly assessing reality. It doesn’t understand its own motives or pleasures. It quickly locks onto answers and is vain and squeamish around the arduous business of self-examination. When pressed for clarification, it typically grows blank or aggressive. It is slyly expedient, preferring short-term sentimental peace to hard long-term truths. It is constantly derailed – in ways it haughtily refuses to recognise – by hormones, low sugar levels and tiredness. It doesn’t readily accept its physical nature, and often petulantly resists an imperative to get an early night. It is deeply marked by its early childhood experiences in ways it can’t fathom without many hours of adult introspection (which it is generally disinclined to invest in). It repeatedly transfers emotions from the past onto the present, where they don’t quite belong, and thereby over- or under-reacts to situations in the here and now. It is structurally unable to count its own blessings and is overwhelmingly focused on the future. It is wired for perpetual anxiety and nagging dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>All the more pity then, that we inhabit an essentially Romantic culture that proclaims its awe of the power of our brains and is reverent towards their first verdicts and schemes – what we call our ‘instincts’. We hear that it is good to ‘trust our feelings’, that reason is ‘cold’ and that there are dangers we might end up ‘thinking too much’ (rather than, as is always the case, merely thinking very badly, which is a different thing).</p>
<p>When we follow our walnuts’ instinctive promptings, our lives threaten rapidly to come undone: we don’t pay sufficient attention to our biases and blindspots; we become entangled in relationships that repeat harmful childhood patterns; we pursue careers unsuited to our true yet unknown natures; we waste a lot of time on things that don’t properly satisfy us …</p>
<p>Compensation for the flaws of our minds is the task of Culture. Culture, which includes the arts, education and politics, can be in a position to counter-balance the eccentricities and foolishness of our walnuts. Culture can alert us to our flaws, make us cautious around our instincts and instil better habits of thinking and feeling. It should endlessly, and with great charm, tug us away from our first, emotional responses and guide us seductively towards wiser, more patient, attitudes.</p>
<p>The art of living lies in knowing how, at an individual and societal level, to manage the melodramas and whims of the Faulty Walnuts through which we wonkily apprehend reality.</p>
