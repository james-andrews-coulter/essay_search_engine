        <h2>2. How to Furnish a Home</h2>
<p>Make a camp. Go on: just like you’re five years old again.</p>
<p>Think of an occasion to justify it: perhaps you’re having a party, or perhaps it’s just Sunday evening and you’ve got a school-night feeling and you’re sitting at home.
  Take the furniture, get a few blankets out, and start off by sitting under the kitchen table. You don’t need to do it for very long – long enough to finish a bottle of wine, perhaps
  – or if you’re feeling really keen, spend the night. Take photographs of your camp – and, if you can, of yourself in it, too.</p>
<p>What room did you make your camp in? What pieces of furniture did you use? How did you misuse them: did you turn them upside down, or back to front? And when you were finished, did you put
  everything back in the same places as before?</p>
