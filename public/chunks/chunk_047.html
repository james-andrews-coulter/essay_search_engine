            <h2>REFLECTIVE LISTENING</h2>
<p>Life constantly brings us into contact with people we care about who—for a range of reasons, perhaps some of them having to do with us—have grown immensely angry or profoundly distressed. We would very much like to calm them down and relieve them of their symptoms, but our techniques for doing so tend to badly miss their targets. When we try to tell them “not to worry,” they slide into even greater panic. When we say that, all told, “it doesn’t really matter,” their irritation heightens. When we explain to them in a warm voice that they could afford to calm down, they pick up a pencil and snap it in two in frustration.</p>
<p>We would at such points be advised to lean on a technique pioneered and much favored by psychotherapy known as “reflective listening.” The theory behind it is that an important share of our most serious problems have no solutions in any practical sense. There are simply no “answers” to losing lots of money, being excluded from a social circle, or failing in a job. Of course, there might be a few steps that could be taken—applying for a loan, throwing a party, or going on a training course—but these are unlikely to be things that we have not thought about before or that could, if implemented, shave off more than a fraction of our pain.</p>
<p>What psychotherapy realizes is that, in our agony, what we desire more than anything, more than we usually even understand, is companionship: for someone else to know that we are suffering and to feel a measure of our pain more or less as we experience it. We yearn to feel that another person appreciates the scale of our despair and the magnitude of our sense of injustice, while at the same time being deeply suspicious of, and alert to, anyone who might too hastily be trying to make our distress go away. “Answers” and “solutions”—because they seek to remove a problem at speed—may in our panicky moments seem indistinguishable from being asked to shut up and talk about something else.</p>
<p>Having fathomed our longing, psychotherapy introduces a key innovation: it proposes a way of behaving around a person who is incensed or sad that can give them a strong feeling that they are being understood. Saying “I know” or “oh yes” won’t—as psychotherapy knows—be quite enough. What we need to do instead is to paraphrase what our ailing companion has said, to build sentences that repeat back to them the essence of the difficulty they have expressed but in different words. This form of precis deftly signals two things: first, that we have precisely grasped what they have gone through, and second, that we have been doing more than listening passively. We haven’t dumbly and distractedly echoed their exact language, as a recording device would; we’ve taken the trouble to find a fresh set of words for the same story. Their woes have passed, and been sympathetically filtered, through the distinctive channels of our own minds.</p>
<p>An episode of reflective listening might go like this. We hear them say: I hate the bloody lecturers at university so much. They ramble and make no sense. I’m taking on huge debts to be there and I might as well be asleep for all the good it will ever do me. To which we might respond: I’m hearing that your course is proving deeply disappointing. You’re finding it hard to understand what’s really going on. And the faculty don’t seem in any way interested in explaining things properly. You’re worrying about how much all this is costing and what contribution, if any, this is going to make to your career goals.</p>
<p>Or someone might tell us: I don’t see why you jump to such unfair conclusions about me. Why can’t you believe that something just slipped my mind? You’re always accusing me . . . To which a reflective listener might answer: I’m sensing that you don’t feel trusted. You think I don’t have enough faith in your good nature and intentions.</p>
<p>The genius of reflective listening is that, on the basis of paraphrasing alone, we can leave our speaker appeased and becalmed. Without anything ostensibly changing, the incensed or sad person’s levels of fear and irritation ebb. The squall passes; hope returns. This teaches us just how much “solutions” may ultimately be overrated. All that we are chiefly in search of when we are at our lowest point is evidence that we are in company.</p>
