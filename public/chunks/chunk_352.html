        <h3>— Apologise</h3>
<p>It is not – in general – that we hate apologies; we are merely terrified of articulating one in a situation where it threatens to make everything worse, where it will immediately be attacked for being inadequate and where it will unleash further rage and blame. But – so long as another might listen – how ready we would be to say that we are deeply sorry. Indeed, those in the confessional were apt to reveal so much because they knew their listener had a patient and generous heart.</p>
<p>If only we could be freed from self-hatred and the fear of retribution by a kind ear, we would find ourselves in a place where we could own up to the full panoply of our errors: our selfishness, short-sightedness, greed, lust, gluttony and arrogance. We could try to explain why we acted as we did and why we were cruel, hasty, irrational and without empathy. We could seek a personal meeting with those we had harmed and offer them every restitution we could – while they, alert to their own fragile and erring natures, would understand their role in resolving the cycle of agony through forgiveness.</p>
