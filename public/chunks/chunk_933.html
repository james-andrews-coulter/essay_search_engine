        <h3>5. Earnestness vs Irony</h3>
<p>The Romantic’s attention is fixed on their search for the ideal relationship; they like to think that anything that bothers them about their partner can be changed. They therefore resist the deflationary call of ironic humour (which says in many different guises – ‘of course we’re both pretty messed up really’) because it seems defeatist.</p>
<p>The Classical conviction is not that their relationship (or their partner or indeed their own personality) is already wonderful; far from it. But rather what they sense is that a cheerful mood is a good starting point for coping in a radically imperfect relationship, which they accept as pretty much the only kind of relationship there really ever is. The priority is not to get everything perfect, and not to give up, despair or run away. Ironic humour is a standard recourse for the Classically minded lover because it emerges from the constant collision between how one would like things to be – and how it seems they in fact are. These types appreciate quite a bit of gallows humour around their relationships.</p>
