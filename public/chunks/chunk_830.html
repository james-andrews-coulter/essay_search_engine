        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>They used to love us. We used to have a future. We would fall asleep in their arms.</p>
<p>We shared our fears and gave them a map to our insecurities. We loved their sense of humour and perspective on our lives. We travelled with them, understood their feelings for their parents, perhaps even decorated a home together. They were our best friend.</p>
<p>And now we are devastated.</p>
<p>We dignify this special pain with a powerful name: heartbreak – because it simply feels as if something essential, something fundamental in us has shattered. We struggle to describe quite what we are going through. Sometimes, for a few hours, it seems we will almost cope. Then we are abruptly reminded that everything good has gone from the world. What we feel most of all is alone – alone with the sadness and confusion, the anger and the incomprehension.</p>
<p>One of the biggest ambitions of art has been to meet us in the dark, to join us when we’re broken and lost – and to remind us of things which, at this moment, we find hard to see: that our pain makes sense, that we are still viable, loveable people, that we will recover and that, however individual the precise details of our suffering may be, we are in fact participating in a sorrow that is common to many.</p>
<p>Everyone we admire, everyone we find interesting has had, or will have, their heart broken. Our heartbreak seems to cut us off from the rest of humanity – secretly it brings us closer together.</p>
<p>What follows is a journey around the universal story of heartbreak.</p>
