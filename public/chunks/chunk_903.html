        <h3>There will be complications everywhere</h3>
<p>If we had been properly forewarned, we would know how practically anything – however innocent it might seem – may turn into grounds for misery. And so we would be a lot less panicky around the horrors we did run into. Three days of sulking? Of course. A threat of divorce? Naturally. An affair (on both sides)? Why not? We would – with resignation and something close to dark glee – be expecting something ghastly every new day.</p>
<p>Maybe a difficult clash of opinions could emerge around car insurance or how much bottled water it is appropriate to drink. A walk to the shops might unleash an episode of resentment about who should be responsible for the heavier bag. There might be an argument about what it means to brush one’s teeth for too long.</p>
<p>We’d imagine that a weekend away together would probably involve a row, a hotel that was not quite as nice as it looked in the photos, a dinner with awkward stretches of silence between us – but maybe also, hopefully, an afternoon walk when we really did talk properly and just maybe (but perhaps not) a drowsy, comfortable morning in bed together.</p>
