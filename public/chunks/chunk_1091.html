        <h3>1The challenge of reciprocation</h3>
<p>Ostensibly, we all want love – but when love actually starts to be reciprocated, it may prove intensely alarming. We can start to think very badly of the person we liked only a little time before. We typically accuse the now-reciprocating lover of two things.</p>
<p>We feel they are naive in finding us wonderful. They like us only because they don’t know how to read human nature. They are gullible and too easily taken in by people. It’s hard to respect seducers who are so psychologically unastute. They are too intellectually limited to ‘read’ us properly. They don’t perceive the less appealing, more disturbed, darker aspects of who we are. Their affections therefore seem precarious and dangerous: they would surely cool if they discovered the truth about us, which is frightening. Therefore, we take extra care to give little away. We feel lonely because, despite the love, big parts of us aren’t in any position to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Also, we accuse these partners of being ‘needy’.They start to rely on us and want us a lot – and, in the process, appear weak and not quite grown up. We wonder why they can’t stand on their own two feet, like a normal adult.</p>
<p>We’re accusing the lover of being in the wrong. But really, the problem almost certainly lies with us. We should consider what is causing us to resort to the words ‘naive’ and ‘needy’. Their alleged naivety is our doing. They think us wonderful, but only because this is the way we have presented ourselves. We have been extraordinarily successful at hiding all our shadow sides from them. It is not they who are naive, it’s we who are good liars. It is normal, during seduction, to throw the light on the more positive aspects of our characters, but there is a phenomenon that goes beyond this, an extreme seduction, where we assiduously hide everything problematic in our characters. What lies behind extreme seduction is self-hatred. We think that, at heart, we are unacceptable people, that no one could really love us if they saw our true selves, and therefore we develop great skill at camouflaging ourselves. This works, at a price of devastating loneliness.</p>
<p>The solution isn’t to blame the other person for naivety; it is to learn to show others who we truly are, on the basis of loosening our suspicion of ourselves. We need to make the initially implausible leap of faith that we might be acceptable to someone else who knew us more completely; we don’t necessarily have to lie in order to deserve love. Furthermore, perhaps the lover isn’t naive at all. They can see us for what we are: they have noticed the nervous efforts at seduction, the manic attempts to please, the shame about our true nature. And they don’t mind; they know we’re not quite who we say we are, but they know we’re not so bad either – and the reality is, they aren’t wrong. So it’s not that they are naive about us, but that we’re naive about them; they’re not the simpletons we judged them to be. They know human nature. They know that, of course, everyone has shadow sides. They’ve made their peace with theirs. They would like us to make peace with ours. Ahead of us, they understand that both they and we are worthy of love. We give up on extreme seduction and learn the art of intelligent self-revelation: the art of gradually and honestly unfolding our complex humanity to a generous witness.</p>
<p>As for ‘neediness’, the term can all too quickly summon up an image of disreputable figures with a lack of boundaries and an insatiable, unwarranted appetite for our time. Perhaps they call us three times an hour to ‘check in’ or get nervous if we go into the next room. There are, of course, a few pathologically dependent people at large, but a lot of the time – far more than is generally accepted – the person who has the problem isn’t the ‘needy’ person, it is us: the ones who are doing the accusing.</p>
<p>We will feel that someone is sickeningly ‘needy’ when we don’t see ourselves as appropriate targets of someone else’s need. Somewhere inside, we don’t trust that we are reliable, strong, dependable, admirable or decent; we aren’t quite grown-up – and so those who need something from us therefore come across as deranged and fitting targets for mockery. At the first sign that someone is becoming reliant on us, we flinch. We suspect that someone who needs us enough to depend on us for a pleasant weekend or a Tuesday evening must be diseased.</p>
<p>However, the solution isn’t necessarily to try to change the lover by telling them to stop asking so much. They most probably aren’t asking too much at all; they are just strong enough to reveal that they aren’t invulnerable. Showing need is a precondition of strength rather than weakness. We should revise our view of ourselves, to see ourselves as more or less plausible people for someone else to stand in need of. The fear of ‘needy’ people is only a species of self-hatred rippling outwards to tar our lover.</p>
<p>A reduction of self-hatred does not depend on self-boosterism (telling ourselves how great we are). We should learn to tolerate ourselves, not by believing we are wonderful, but via a secure realisation that everyone is both OK and sometimes a bit awful. We can be cured of our uncommonly vicious self-suspicion by a more accurate vision of what constitutes normality. Of course we are a bit weak, a bit sly and a bit foolish, to put it gently. But so is everyone. We are no more idiotic or wayward than the next person. We can embrace a person’s hopes for a close and deep relationship with us simply on the basis that we are all a bit odd and broken. The need that the lover has of us is not delusional; it is an accurate request that any flawed human might make of another comparably damaged example.</p>
<p>To cope better with the challenges of reciprocated love, we need to nuance what we believe love means. We are appalled by reciprocated love when we operate with a background idea of sentimental love. This states that loving ourselves is what we can do only when we are totally pure, and that loving another is what we can do only when someone is perfect. Yet we are, of course, all deeply flawed.</p>
<p>The origins of a sentimental interpretation of love usually lie with parents who could not tolerate their children’s shadow sides. Somewhere in the past, a child had to be perfect in order to deserve affection. Tantrums, bad habits and nasty thoughts had to be banished. The child became outwardly ‘good’ and inwardly ashamed and lonely. We need to move towards a more humane and mature model of complex love; a love that tolerates imperfection and ambivalence, that accepts that we can have faults and love ourselves and can see the faults of another person and still love them.</p>
