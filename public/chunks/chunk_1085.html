        <h2>Utopia</h2>
<p>Some of the most important places we could visit are those that exist as yet only in dreams: speculative landscapes and cities summoned up by utopian thinkers who have tried to imagine how we should ideally live, how our houses should ideally look, what we should ideally value and how we should ideally love. The places may not be real, but they are something more important still: they excite us to want to alter present reality in the name of a more tolerable and fulfilling future.</p>
<p>The utopian French 18th-century architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux dreamt of cities that would be better than those where he had lived and worked. He wanted to create places that would be harmonious, sociable, egalitarian and elegant, and over a number of years designed an ideal settlement, which he pictured taking shape in the wooded region of Chaux, near Besançon in eastern France. He mapped out spacious residential avenues, inspiring public squares, a House of Union where people could meet in the evenings, and a Temple of Memory where they would commemorate the dead and celebrate the changes of the seasons. The Chaux city never came into being, but its example provokes us still to ask ourselves — amidst our own urban mess — what cities should be like and what we could improve if we were not so inert and in thrall to traditional arrangements.</p>
<p>An accusation of ‘utopian thinking’ can sound like an insult; we are meant to pride ourselves on being grounded, realistic and sober. Insofar as we dare to imagine the future, we do so with one peculiar tic: we cautiously ask ourselves what the future will be like on the basis of current trends. We almost never ask the one big, philosophically minded question: what should the future be like? We proceed as humble futurologists, viewing what is to come as something to be guessed at, rather than as bolder and more directive utopian philosophers, laying down a blueprint for what we want to happen.</p>
<p>Or else we believe that because we cannot master all the practical challenges in the way of a better future, we have no right to dream of it. But that is to give too privileged a place to obstacles and too small a role to the imagination, which must always come prior to, and can be independent of, the subsequent work of realisation.</p>
<p>We should dare to open up a utopian strand to our reflection — and to our mental travels. We should clarify our dissatisfactions with what exists by asking ourselves in detail: what sort of better world can we journey to? What would the streets be like there? How would marriage be arranged, how would children be brought up, what would mass entertainment promote?</p>
<p>We almost certainly have all the ingredients of our own utopias present in our minds already, but a shyness holds us back from focusing on them to the extent that they might evolve into a plan. We mustn’t only sigh about how things are. We should travel in our minds to how they should, and could one day, be.</p>
