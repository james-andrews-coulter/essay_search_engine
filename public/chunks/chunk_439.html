        <h3>History</h3>
<p>Comparable relief can also come from the reading of history books, so we would be wise to make these central to our schedules. To abstract us from our circumstances, we can lose ourselves in the history of the Norte Chico civilisation, which formed in what is now Peru in around 3500 BCE, or the exploits of Mesopotamian culture in the Ubaid period (c. 5900–4000 BCE), or the rise and fall of the thirty-one kings of China’s Shang dynasty between 1600 and 1046 BCE. We can hold up for our contemplation the battered crowns of forgotten Norse kings, the earrings of long-dead Roman noblewomen or the burial hoard of once-terrifying Mongol leaders.</p>
<p>We are usually taught to read history books in order to discover other peoples and times, but we can do so just as usefully – given our condition – to drive home the message that no peoples and no times ever resist the forces of entropy and oblivion. History, even the most well-recorded kind, is filled with raided tombs, empty caskets, lost books and indecipherable texts. Most of what mattered then doesn’t endure; almost all that was once deemed important is trampled underfoot or buried beneath a car park. We can read history as a promise – an advance notice – that we will one day also, thankfully, be forgotten.</p>
