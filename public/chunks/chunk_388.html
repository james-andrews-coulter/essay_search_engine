        <h2>2. Do Something Enjoyable Alone</h2>
<p>In addition to looking at how you spend your leisure time, it is also interesting to look at your own ‘maintenance’ time. This is partly because household
  maintenance is something that not only can be, but often is, done alone. If you are trying to find time for solitude you may already have it if you stop seeing vacuuming as a disagreeable task and
  see it instead as a period of peaceful solitude; since it has a clear purpose and a definite point of completion, it may even turn out to be a very easy and unscary way of being alone.</p>
