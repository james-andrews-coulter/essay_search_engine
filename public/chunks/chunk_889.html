        <h3>There’s something we really want to do in bed but we feel we can’t possibly ask our partner</h3>
<p>With unfortunate encouragement from our societies, friendship groups and upbringing, we develop the idea that there are certain specific ways to get respectably excited in bed – and that there are, by contrast, a hinterland of ‘taboo’ fantasies that only hugely weird or sick people would ever find thrilling.</p>
<p>But because something in this taboo area excites us nevertheless, we may have a constant anxiety around how our partner would react were we to be honest. We anticipate humiliation and rejection from the person who knows us best at a moment of maximal supposed authenticity. And so sex (however good it may be in other respects) can become an arena of pain, shame and sullen anger.</p>
<p>The solution is to burn a fundamental truth into our minds: sexual desire is inherently strange and we are not responsible for any of its oddities (the only caveat being that we mustn’t hurt any unconsenting people with our wants). The idea of there being a limited ‘good’ way of having sex is a local, recent (and very unkind) invention – not a reflection of reality. The person who insists that only ‘normal’ sex is acceptable isn’t an ideal representative of sanity; they are almost certainly someone in denial about their own more deeply hidden, but equally exotic, fantasies.</p>
<p>What we have to keep in mind – when we falter in the face of admitting a desire to our partner – is that there is a very reasonable and standard story to be told about why we have ended up with the particular kink we have. We need first to trace that story for ourselves, piecing it together in sympathetic steps from childhood onwards – and then dare to tell our partners without shame or judgement. This is just who we are, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>We should introduce our partner to the less familiar zones of our excitement not when we are actually in bed with them and urgently wanting to do something – the point of maximal urgency is, strategically, the least suitable moment for revelation – but at a time when we can interest them in the story of our life.</p>
