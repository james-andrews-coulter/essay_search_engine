        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>1.     Collect your courage and write down (in invisible ink if need be) something you feel inwardly awkward about in yourself, something you can’t bring yourself to confess to a potential partner – even though it isn’t, in fact, any kind of betrayal. It’s embarrassing, but for no good reason.</p>
<p>2.     Write down – at as great a length as possible and going into maximum detail – the actual story of how this ‘oddity’ emerged in your life.</p>
<p>3.     Polish your oddity, organise it, focus on the key points. Practise saying it. Rehearse it in front of the mirror. Be completely solid in knowing that it deserves to be sympathetically grasped by someone you are interested in.</p>
<p>4.     Tell them. Early on.</p>
