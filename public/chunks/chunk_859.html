        <h2>20 TYPES OF ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p>Some of the reason why we argue so much and so repetitively is that we aren’t guided to spot the similarities that run through our arguments; we do not have to hand an easy typology of squabbles that could be to domestic conflict what an encyclopedia of birds is to an ornithologist.</p>
<p>What follows, therefore, is a description and diagnosis of twenty of the most common forms of arguments that unfold between couples.</p>
<p>Though fights can, from the outside, look generic, with similar displays of agitation and aggression, we should come to recognise the very distinct kinds of rows in operation. Each type listed here foregrounds a particular way in which we typically fail to communicate a vital and intense truth to a partner.</p>
<p>By examining them in turn, we may gradually assemble an understanding of some of the obstacles we face in relationships, and greet moments of dissent with a little less surprise and rather more tolerance and humorous recognition. We will be reminded once more that love is a skill, not an emotion.</p>
