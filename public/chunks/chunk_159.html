        <h2>7.The Importance of the Sun</h2>
<p>We’re supposed to be serious people with important things on our minds. But we can admit it without guilt: seeking sun is one of the central, and most important, motives behind going travelling.</p>
<p>We have, after all, been cold for so long. For months, we have been fending off wind, rain and despair. Through the impossibly long winter and freezing spring, we have been swaddling ourselves in layers. We hardly ever see our own legs – beyond a reluctant glance at their pallor in the bath. We have eaten for comfort. And it shows, a bit. But deep within us, we know we are essentially made for sunny mornings, hot lazy afternoons and warm nights that echo to the sound of cicadas.</p>
<p>On the beach, there are recliners under big straw sunshades. The water is warm. The heat envelops us and warms us to the core. Every day, the sky is perfectly blue and unclouded. From the hotel balcony, we can look out onto a succession of arid and scrubby hills; we love the sight of the baked and cracked earth because it speaks of weeks upon weeks of hot, dry weather.</p>
<p>It can suddenly seem inhuman that our species has so cleverly managed to sustain itself in places that are windswept, wet and dreary for almost the whole year. We have made good lives for ourselves up there – in Wiesbaden, Trondheim, Hyvinkää and Calgary. But at such a cost.</p>
<p>Sunshine isn’t merely ‘nice’. It has a profound role in our lives. It is an agent of moral qualities: generosity, courage, the appreciation of the present moment and a confidence in our surroundings. We can feel our character changing in the sun: becoming something we like a lot more. When the world seems bountiful and easy (as it does in the heat), material accumulation looks less impressive or necessary. When we can have so much pleasure from sitting in a T-shirt and shorts and feasting on a feta and tomato salad, competing wildly for promotion loses its point. When it is so hot, there is no point even trying to read – or think too much.</p>
<p>The sun can correct our usual vices. The ways of the north are liable to be overly dominant and entrenched in our lives. We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and cautious.</p>
<p>It is a deeply noble search for wisdom and balance (which are the ideal goals of art, civilisation and travel) that has led us here – to an enchanting world of sun cream, dark glasses, recliners and vividly coloured cocktails by the pool.</p>
