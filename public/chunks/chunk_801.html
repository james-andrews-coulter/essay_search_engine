            <h2>IV : Freedom</h2>
<p>There are few more emotive or beguiling words than “freedom.” Even without examining it very closely, and perhaps especially then, the term tends to evoke something especially honorable, enticing, and good, of which we would always want more and could never stand to be deprived.</p>
<p>In our societies, the word has been especially resonant at the collective level, so much so that when we nowadays think of freedom, it is first and foremost political freedom that we might have in mind. It’s in the name of political freedom that millions have marched, chanted, and risked their lives in demonstrations and struggles over the centuries: in Paris in 1789 and Bucharest in 1877, in Lima’s Plaza Mayor in 1885 and Leipzig’s Karl-Marx-Platz in 1989.</p>
<p>The freedom that we can, in certain parts of the world, now take for granted—the right to own property, to express negative opinions about the government, and to live without fear of arbitrary arrest—is the result of five hundred years of fearless effort on the part of the defenders of liberty. It is because, in the cities of northern Italy and the Low Countries, medieval merchants rose up against their tyrannical feudal overlords, because seventeenth-century political theorists carefully took apart the claims of absolutist monarchies, and because groups of determined students in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Europe refused to kowtow to the rule of dictators that we can nowadays lob sarcastic remarks at our mediocre rulers and look at the security forces without fear.</p>
<p>But if politicians know that they can always be sure of drawing a powerful response from their audiences by brandishing the word “freedom”—and labeling their opponents as its enemies—it is in part on the basis of a subtle emotional sleight of hand. We are open to being mobilized by a promise of freedom in politics because it is a quality that, even if only in a semiconscious way, we long for in our personal and psychological lives.</p>
<p>Even when, at the level of the state, we have all the freedoms we need, we may lack freedom of the spirit. We might be free but not feel free. Without there being any formal chains around us, we may have an impression of being hemmed in or uncomfortably observed. We may be afraid of departing from convention and of doing things that our friends or people we went to school with wouldn’t approve of. A sense of inward freedom turns out to be in its own way even more complicated than political freedom—and its enemies more subtle.</p>
<p>Were we to draw up a charter of what we can call psychological freedom, we might need to include some of the following constituents:</p>
<p>freedom from fear of judgment</p>
<p>freedom from the weight of public opinion</p>
<p>freedom from society’s ideas of normality</p>
<p>freedom from society’s definitions of a good relationship</p>
<p>freedom from standard beliefs about status</p>
<p>freedom from expected consumption patterns</p>
<p>freedom from fashionable opinions</p>
<p>freedom from the pressure to be normal, ambitious, or optimistic</p>
<p>All these will contribute, in their absence, to much more elusive forms of enmeshment than those we know in the political sphere. The prohibitions are much harder to track—and the forms of suffering they generate more insidious in their effects.</p>
<p>We lack the iron-clad reliable vocabulary open to those who seek to defend political freedoms. We know the importance of “freedom from arbitrary arrest”; we’re still at the dawn of appreciating what it might mean to be free enough not to consult social media or to resist the pressure to parrot fashionable opinions—let alone take off for a hut in the woods, flout the latest shibboleth on relationships, or never go to another party again.</p>
<p>We are still feeling our way to an understanding of what a genuinely free life would be like: what we could refuse, who we could stop listening to, what we could dare to focus on if we were brave enough to take our own consciences and sensations as our lodestars. We may remain, in our hearts, every bit as unfree as an unbeliever in a totalitarian religious regime or a dissident under observation of the state apparatus. We can be no less fearful, our choices just as constrained, our ability to roam as we would wish equally compromised.</p>
<p>We have been fighting for liberty from state control for centuries. The quest now is to identify and then more robustly hold on to the key ingredients of psychological freedom. For this, we need humbly to accept how still relatively unfamiliar we might be with the idea of being free in and of ourselves. We should concede that shackles and obedience come to us far more readily than do indiscipline and the solitary path. Though we may flatter ourselves through identification with lone rebels and renegades, we are by nature docile, pliable, accommodating herd animals with a ready appetite to go meekly wherever our shepherds might dictate.</p>
<p>We need—though the phrase may sound peculiar—to learn to be free, to rid ourselves of the invisible hierarchies in our minds and the fears bequeathed to us by our histories. We need to lean on examples of once-timid people who grew into themselves, discern the bars of our cages, and properly identify who and what is wasting what remains of our years. We may have loved the idea of freedom for a long time already; now come the challenge and opportunity of leading a life that is truly our own.</p>
<p>1 Sonnet 29 and Failure</p>
<p>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast state,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,And look upon myself and curse my fate,Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,With what I most enjoy contented least;Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,Haply I think on thee, and then my state,(Like to the lark at break of day arisingFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;</p>
<p>For thy sweet love remembered such wealth bringsThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>
<p>Sonnet 29, written around 1592, finds William Shakespeare, then in his late twenties, in a highly fragile state. He is worried about failure. He is contemplating a future in which he will be a social pariah, his mention enough to provoke revulsion. He will be in agony, pondering his stupidity and bad luck. He will lament that he can’t practice the job he most enjoys—and he will look around and feel desperation and envy of all those who remain so much more successful than he is and who will still enjoy esteem and their good name.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a paradox that the most acclaimed writer in English literature should have worried so acutely about failure; that he should have been so like us in fearing that he would one day—through a mixture of his own idiocy and unfortunate outside events—be a disgraced nobody. Then again, “greatness” in literature doesn’t come from living pompously among high-flown abstractions; great writers are ultimately simply those who know how to speak with special honesty about the panic and sadness of an ordinary life.</p>
<p>What had brought Shakespeare to this anxious, vigilant state? Why was he so afraid he was going to lose it all? Partly, it was because he was not yet very well established. He’d written only Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI. In the coming years, he would write—in quick succession—A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night. But as yet these would have been mere sketches in his mind. There was another problem. Shakespeare had a famous and very vicious enemy who was spreading rumors about him and seemed determined to bring him down. He was a fellow playwright called Robert Greene.</p>
<p>Greene loathed Shakespeare. He wrote an open letter warning that “There is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers heart wrapt in a Players hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you.” He nicknamed him “Shakescene” that is, a show-off and a popularizing fool—and, to further rub in how untalented he was, a jack of all trades or “Johannes Factotum.” In different circumstances but with equal unfairness, we all have Robert Greenes around us. The world abounds in them and makes life a good deal more terrifying and nasty than it should be.</p>
<p>The London theater world was small, mean, and very gossipy. This kind of review from a respected playwright was intended to damage and it would have done huge harm. One can imagine Shakespeare, still young and finding his feet in the capital, panicking at how bad the sniping was getting, worrying that such insults would never stop, knowing how many people had had a mean laugh at his expense, fearful that his good intentions would never surface and that he would for ever be known as a cheap, unscrupulous idiot.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bubonic plague had returned, as it did continually to England in the Elizabethan age. The year before Shakespeare’s birth, an outbreak had killed 80,000 and now it was back. Between August 1592 and January 1593, 20,000 people died in the southeast of England, 15,000 of them in London. There was rioting in the streets and Queen Elizabeth moved out to Windsor Castle for her safety. The government shut down all pubs and theatres for six months. Every actor and playwright was out of work. Not only was his name being trashed, Shakespeare was facing financial ruin.</p>
<p>How to bear the terror of failure? With Shakespeare as our guide, though the impulse may be to turn away from fear, what can calm us down is to sit with what scares us most. We should dare to investigate the terrifying scenario so as to drain it of its strangeness and stop apprehending it only through the corners of our eyes in shame. Shakespeare openly meditates on what might happen: He pictures the worst that could unfold in order to see how it might be borne. He also renders himself cathartically vulnerable in the process; he makes no bones about his suffering to us in the future and, we can imagine, to the people more immediately around him. He is going to admit just how bad things are for him in order to break his isolation and sense of unacceptability. He will try to universalize what could otherwise feel like only a very personal and embarrassing affliction. He will dare to see if anyone else has ever suffered as he has—and hold out an imaginary hand of friendship to all his readers, as writers will.</p>
<p>But then comes the core of the consoling process. He recognizes implicitly that what is driving his wish to be successful is the desire to be respected and liked. It might be money and fame that he is drawn to, but beneath these there is another hunger: to be treated well and to avoid humiliation. There is a quest for love hiding within the drive to be somebody. Once that idea is established, a deeply redemptive maneuver comes into view. We don’t actually ever need the whole of society to love us. We don’t have to have everyone on our side. Let the Robert Greenes of this world—and their many successors in newspapers, living rooms, and social media down the ages—say their very worst and nastiest things and be done with them. All that we need is the love of a few friends or even just one special person and we can survive.</p>
<p>The love of a single sensitive and intelligent being can compensate us for the loss of love from the world and with such a gift we can, as Shakespeare says, be in a better place than “kings.” Popular success is an unreliable goal, at the mercy of fickle fortune. There are so many jealous people and we are prone to make mistakes that they can use to bring us down. What we must therefore try to do is cultivate—and look forward to leaning on—the affection and regard of sympathetic companions. Others may be scoffing, others may sneer every time our name comes up in conversation, but we will be secure. We will be somewhere far from the gossipy and plague-ridden city, living quietly with those who properly know us and for whom we won’t need to do anything more to deserve a place in their hearts.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s Sonnet 29 has been prized for four centuries because it latches on with such sincerity to an anxiety that afflicts us all—and proposes a solution that we know must be correct. In the end, things may turn out all right: the plague may recede, business may pick up, the rumor mill may die down and leave us alone. But if none of this happens, if it does all go wrong and we become a definitive byword for awfulness, then in our moments of high anxiety, especially late at night, we should know the fallback: a few generous, sincere, emotionally mature souls who know about forgiveness and kindness, sympathy and charity, who won’t reduce us to one horrid nickname, who will love us with the complex regard that a parent might bestow on a child or a god on its creations. Love will redeem us. We may well fail, but we don’t need to fear it will be hell—and so we can afford to approach challenges with a little more freedom and light-heartedness. The cleverest and most humane writer who ever lived knew as much; in our panic we should trust him.</p>
<p>2 How to Live in a Hut</p>
<p>There’s a dread that we normally keep at the far edges of our minds but that occasionally—particularly at three o’clock on a restless night floods our thoughts: If we don’t constantly strive to achieve, if we slip up, or if some new catastrophe strikes the economy, we’ll lose pretty much everything and we’ll end up having to live in a caravan, a tiny one-room apartment or—God forbid—a hut in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>The bleakness of this image spurs us to ever more frantic efforts. We’d settle for almost anything to avoid it: oppressively long working hours; a job that holds no interest; risky money-making schemes; a loveless marriage that keeps us in the family home; or, maybe, decades of suffering the whims of a grim relative for the prospect of an inheritance. The hut is a symbol of disaster and humiliation.</p>
<p>It’s in this fear-laden context that we might consider the case of a man called Kamo no Chomei, who was born in Japan around 1155. His father was the well-to-do head of a prominent religious shrine near Kyoto, which was then the capital, and Chomei grew up in luxurious circumstances. He received a refined education and in the early part of his adult life had an elegant social circle. When he was still in his twenties, his grandmother left him a big house and his future looked bright. But then it all started to go wrong. He made enemies and was sidelined in his career; he got into financial difficulties and, by the time he was fifty, he had alienated his former friends, had practically no money left—and was going bald.</p>
<p>Chomei was forced to reform his existence and survive on the most slender material base. Far out in the country, where no one else wanted to live, he built himself a tiny hut—just ten feet by ten. It was, he reflected, one hundredth of the size of the mansion in which he’d grown up. It wasn’t even a permanent structure; his situation was so precarious he had to ensure that his home could be dismantled and carted away.</p>
<p>A modern reconstruction shows just how small and basic it was, but doesn’t convey its isolated position in the hills at Toyama, which was considered the back of beyond. Rotting leaves collected on the roof, moss grew on the floor, and the water supply was just a rickety bamboo pipe leading from a nearby stream to a little pool by the door. Chomei cooked outside, though eventually he rigged up a small awning to keep the rain off in wet weather. He slept on a pile of bracken on the floor, he had no furniture, and he lived mainly on nuts, berries, and wild root vegetables which he foraged from the woods—and quite often he went hungry. The only people he saw were a family of peasants who lived at the foot of the hill whom his former grand friends would have dismissed as lowly rustics. He could afford only clothes made from the coarsest cloth and they soon became mere rags, leaving him indistinguishable from the beggars he used to see in the city. It was here, in this way, that Chomei lived for fifteen years, up to his death in his mid-sixties.</p>
<p>Kawai Shrine within the Shimogamo Shrine, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, Kinki Region, Japan.</p>
<p>It was also here that he wrote a short book, The Ten Square Foot Hut, one of the great masterpieces of Japanese literature. It’s not—as we might expect—a lament, poring over the misfortunes and betrayals that led him to this degraded condition. Instead it’s full of good cheer, happiness, and pleasure. The most touching line in the whole of the essay is the simple affirmation: “I love my little hut, my simple dwelling.”</p>
<p>What, we can ask, was it that enabled Chomei to find fulfillment in such an apparently unpromising place? It wasn’t that he was naturally drawn to a minimal material life: No one who’d known him earlier, in his days of prosperity, would have imagined that he could thrive under such circumstances—least of all himself. He wasn’t someone who for years had been hankering after the simple life. He moved to the hut in desperation and against his inclinations; it was only once he was there that he discovered that he liked it—that it was in fact his ideal home.</p>
<p>Chomei was guided by a distinctive philosophy. And this is a principle of hope, for we can’t magically take on another individual’s personality but we can understand, and perhaps come to share, their ideas. Temperament may be fixed but philosophy is transferable. From his book, we can identify four crucial ideas that together transformed what could have been a purely grim experience into one of deep and tranquil satisfaction.</p>
