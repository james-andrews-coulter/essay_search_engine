            <h2>II : Love</h2>
<p>Central to the process of overcoming mental turmoil is learning more about what love really is, so that we can detect its absence in the way we treat ourselves and start to nurture and honor its presence in those we decide to be close to.</p>
<p>We are often sold a fundamentally and unhelpfully romantic view of love, which proposes that love is the reward given to a person for their strengths: it is what someone can expect to receive when they are supremely beautiful, rich, impressive, or popular. The most lovable person on earth is—according to this philosophy—simultaneously the most gifted and consummate one.</p>
<p>But there is another, broader, nobler conception that understands love not as a reward for strength but as a sympathy for, and commitment to attending to, weakness. Love is what we feel when we see a small baby, helpless before the world, reaching out for our finger, clasping it tight and pulling a frail and grateful smile. Love is what we register when our partner, usually composed and competent, comes to us with apology and confusion, begging for our help.</p>
<p>However impressed we may be by beauty and flawless achievement, what we should truly love is vulnerability. We begin to love, rather than merely admire, when others no longer have to exhibit perfection to seem worthy. Simultaneously, the people we should put our faith in are those who do not recoil from us in our frightened or hesitant moments, those who don’t just want to clap at us and be awed by our triumphs. They are those who can be moved by our crises, who are on hand in the dark hours, who will still be around when the rest of the world is jeering.</p>
<p>Similarly, the properly self-loving person isn’t the one who congratulates themselves when they have pulled off an astonishing feat; it’s the one who knows how to speak to themselves in a kind voice when everything has gone wrong, who can remain kind in the face of ill fortune, who doesn’t have to berate or criticize themselves without mercy. We should feel proud of having attained a capacity for such love. It isn’t weakness or charity; it is an achievement founded on the most dignified understanding of what we must do to accede to our full humanity.</p>
<p>We will have finally learned to love ourselves and others when fragility and imperfection touch us and incite our desire to assist, to understand, and to console.</p>
<p>1 Learning to Love</p>
<p>To begin with the love of others . . . A melancholy paradox lies at the heart of modern relationships: We know that to thrive emotionally must involve love, but on the ground contented unions are dauntingly rare. It is tempting to believe that those for whom love works out have been granted a form of divine favor. But we cannot build a decent life on the hope of randomly distributed heavenly munificence.</p>
<p>There is no need for superstition or despair. Good relationships are neither mysterious nor random. There are solid, rationally structured explanations for why some people do well together while others, despite powerful initial hopes and touchingly idealistic intentions, do not. Success seems random simply because we have to date operated with an insufficiently firm grip on the actual mechanics of true love.</p>
<p>There are, in reality, only a small number of fundamental factors that account for the well-being of every robust, loving couple. Though relationships might seem infinitely varied, whether they succeed or fail comes down, in essence, to the presence—or absence—of five anchors.</p>
<p>(I) NON-DEFENSIVENESS</p>
<p>However sweet and fascinating two people might initially be, it is inescapable that they will also with time, and the birth of true intimacy, stumble upon aspects of one another’s characters that cannot help but generate difficulties and a degree of dismay. Each partner could be determined to be only kind, but the way that they shell an egg, leave the bathroom, deal with their suitcase on returning from a trip, handle the household keys, or tell an anecdote will gradually unleash powerful degrees of frustration or puzzlement in those they must share their lives with.</p>
<p>One of the most basic features of our natures is that we are defensive. That is, we seek to ward off psychic pain and defend ourselves against perceived attacks. Our minds are squeamish. We try to uphold a bearable picture of ourselves in the face of any possible insights or criticisms that others may direct toward—us or that could emanate from the more perceptive recesses of our own minds. We are not keen on feedback. Our defensiveness is a profoundly understandable tendency, yet it is also behind a predominant share of the failure of all relationships.</p>
<p>The problem starts when we, as partners, venture to air what we have noticed. We might start out politely and tentatively, gently mentioning the strands of hair in the basin or the muddled telling of anecdotes in front of strangers. But thoughtful receptivity can be hard to come by. Our partner is in danger of treating our remarks as if they were a direct attack, as something no sound adult could ever really be bothered by; they might go strangely quiet or immediately accuse us of being hugely unkind or malevolently judgmental. Or they might slyly turn the tables and start listing—with less and less good humor—certain things that they find awful about us and that they have been holding on to privately for a long time. Whatever strategy they adopt, the underlying meaning tends to be the same: that being found in some way imperfect is entirely unacceptable and deeply contrary to the spirit of true love.</p>
<p>“Love me for who I am” is the fateful rallying cry of all lovers headed for disaster. It is in reality a monstrously unfair—though entirely understandable—demand to be loved just as we are, with our panoply of faults, compulsions, neuroses, and immaturities. But with a modicum of self-awareness and honesty, we should only ever expect to be loved for who we hope to be, for who we are at our best moments, for the good that lies in us in a latent and not-yet-realized state.</p>
<p>The spirit of true love should require that whenever there is feedback, we turn gratefully to our partner and ask for more, that we continuously search to access a better version of ourselves, that we see love as a classroom in which our lover can teach us one or two things about who we should become—rather than as a burrow in which our existing errors can be sentimentally endorsed and encouraged.</p>
<p>In order to overcome defensiveness, we need to understand its sources; we have to think about defensiveness not in its obdurate, dismaying present manifestations but in its greatly more benevolent and engaging origins. Defensiveness is almost invariably founded on an intimate history that no defensive person consciously chose and that, compassionately recounted, might move us to tears. Defensiveness is a legacy of early pain. There might have been a shy six-year-old with a robust, confident parent who was ashamed of their timid, lonely child. No one much seemed to care for this soft-cheeked, large-eyed creature at home. There were criticisms and hints that another sibling was favored. Love, as this poor soul encountered it, was a scarce, easily lost commodity. For anything to be pointed out to them was, as they came to think, a harbinger of fresh contempt and renewed exclusion from everything sustaining and kind. Or else a parent was intermittently admiring and then terrifyingly angry at their offspring if there was the slightest drop in performance at school. Defensive people did not magically acquire their ferocity in relation to our comments, but rather suffered from some form of early neglect or encounter with unsteady, fluctuating warmth. No wonder that such a person might respond with alarm, even viciousness, when the slightest negative thought about them rears its head in a lover they felt ready to entrust with their whole being. There could, in the mind of the unfortunate sufferer, plainly be no such thing as affectionate criticism, no such thing as helpful feedback, no possibility of being at once adored and upbraided. Love cannot be conceived of as coexisting alongside occasional moments of evaluation. It is on the basis of such awkward, emotionally scarred internal associations that defensiveness is built.</p>
<p>A less-defended attitude isn’t a random gift; it is something we can aim for every bit as much as we can aim for a flatter stomach or a tidier house. Even if we didn’t have an ideal introduction to life, we can access ideas that dismantle the equation between love-worthiness and untouchable perfection. We can begin to become less defensive when we take some of the following on board.</p>
<p>Our early experience isn’t a guide to the present</p>
<p>Our defenses were the best we could do in the face of early harshness. We were confronted with problems and demands far beyond our strength. But a decent partner, if we let them know our background troubles, will be moved by our tender desperation and hasty fear. And they can, so long as we master our panic, help us to see that the thing we should be afraid of now is not criticism but an inability to accept its occasional kindly manifestations.</p>
<p>By the background standard of the defensive person, no one could ever be loved</p>
<p>If love really required an absence of even the most minor flaws, no one could possibly qualify for a relationship. Yet in reality, we are love-worthy not because we are perfect, but because none of us ever can be.</p>
<p>Irritation isn’t objective</p>
<p>We need not feel overly targeted by criticism. Every partner has their own particular fixations and preoccupations that make them latch on to certain features of another’s character. That a partner is annoyed with us over something is no sign that we are doing anything appalling per se, so we can afford to feel unpersecuted by their judgment. Some people wouldn’t mind a messy cupboard; not everyone cares about a lengthy anecdote. An issue can be worth discussing amicably not because it is a fundamental failing but simply because it happens to bother someone we love.</p>
<p>Love isn’t fragile</p>
<p>In the defensive person’s mind, the least comment is like the small rockfall that announces an avalanche. There seems no way to trust that it really is just about how long pasta should be cooked or the right way to make a bed. The underlying intention seems always to be to inflict a devastating wound and speed the entire relationship to a close. The defensive person has not had a chance to experience the robustness of love—how it is possible to call someone the worst names in the lexicon and then, ten minutes later, want to lie softly in their arms, tenderness having been renewed and reinvigorated by an opportunity to purge frustration. There can be ruptures—and repair. True love is resilient. It is not destroyed by a detail but only ever by the way that a detail can’t be acknowledged or processed.</p>
<p>Defensiveness can be outgrown. We can learn to measure in our hearts the difference between a complaint and an existential rejection. We can come to hear a criticism without connecting it to damnation. That love once seemed fragile doesn’t mean it must be today. We can trust that we may on occasion irritate a partner without concluding that they will for that matter hate everything about us unto eternity.</p>
<p>When searching for a partner, we need to look out for someone who can join us in the noble quest to recognize and overcome defensiveness. We might even raise this ambition on an early date—“I’d like one day to move to the country, learn Spanish and, with a lover’s help, get over my defensiveness,” we might declare by way of introducing our goals. We could frame the attempt to listen to criticism without fury or hurt as belonging to one of life’s mightiest challenges—alongside sporting excellence or business success. Eventually, with a lot of effort, we would hope to reach the stage when a partner could point out with tact and humanity that we had bad breath or that our shoes didn’t match our sweater and, rather than reacting as we have grown up to do, we could simply turn to them, smile benignly and say what flawed humans should always respond with when another member of the species deigns to help them to grow into a better version of themselves: Thank you.</p>
<p>(II) VULNERABILITY</p>
<p>There’s a second criterion crucial for relationship success: The person who is good at love is good at being vulnerable.</p>
<p>We make ourselves psychologically vulnerable whenever we let a partner know some of the ways in which we are weak, needy, scared, immature, incompetent, or just plain odd—that is, some of the ways in which we are human. To be vulnerable is to dare to take off the usual cloak of normality and sensibleness with which we navigate the world and, for once, to show someone who we really are, with all the fragility and unusualness implied. We might, as vulnerable people, admit to having unsteady minds; to being prone to terror, despair, paranoia, and self-hatred.</p>
<p>It’s a hugely complicated step to confess—especially in front of someone we fundamentally want to impress and secure the affection of that there are basic ways in which we fall short of what a sane adult is meant to be like. A certain kind of no-nonsense partner might well tell us sternly to grow up, complain about us to their friends and make hasty moves to end the relationship.</p>
<p>As a result, we often lie, not for advantage or thievery, but in order to keep hold of a love we desperately want to rely on. We pretend to be strong and unafraid. We disown our needs and longings. We put on a show of being someone else. Such acting works in many contexts. An uncomplaining, breezy competence and unemotive intelligence probably make for an ideal employee, an admirable committee member, and a thoroughly respectable citizen of the modern world. But in an intimate relationship, this form of barricaded caution is fatal. Our fears and inadequacies don’t vanish because we have hidden them; we don’t get any less childlike or odd because we have learned to appear sensible. We simply end up making it impossible for a partner to know us—and, because they are likely to take their lead from our own reserve, they will be unable to show themselves to us in turn. We enclose ourselves in the high walls of our deceptions.</p>
<p>To dare to be vulnerable involves a faith that whatever we are inwardly most afraid and ashamed of in our own natures must have counterparts in other people. We cannot be alone in our oddities and our symptoms. The only people we can assume are “normal” or “sane” are those we don’t yet know very well. But once we are past the flawless exterior, every person we meet—and especially the person we are now dating—will have their share of follies and tender spots: they will be unable to temper their panic, they will fear disgrace, they won’t remember how to soothe themselves. We are guaranteed not to be alone in our terrors and neediness. And what is more, it’s only on the basis of mutual disclosure of susceptibility that a true bond can be built. We may admire paragons of strength and stoicism; we can never properly love them.</p>
<p>To be vulnerable is in essence to let a partner catch sight of a side of us that dates back to childhood: the distant time when we feared Mommy would never come back, when we cried and no one comforted us, when Daddy shouted at us and we were frozen with dismay, when a rough friend told us we were a baby for still loving our stuffed elephant, when no one wanted to play with us in the playground, when we tried and tried to explain but Granny was still angry. To be properly, fully vulnerable is to take the other into the frightened, small places of our past and let them see that we’re still in significant ways the little, distressed people we once were. Honest, vibrant love is an encounter between two vulnerable children who otherwise do a very good job of masquerading as adults.</p>
<p>What makes people reject the offer of vulnerability? The strength they insist on displaying to the world is an indicator of how punishing they have had to be toward their fragile inner selves; it’s a measure of how fast they have had to grow up. If Mommy dismissed their night-time fears they will have had to try to tell themselves desperately that Mommy was right and that crybabies really are disgusting. They perhaps deflected the rough boys’ taunting of Minko, who had been knitted by Granny while they were still in the womb and whose trunk had half disintegrated under the intensity of their hugs, by throwing the little soft toy in the bin. They managed their traumas by siding with those who had hurt them. They focused on keeping their room tidy, passing exams, and learning how to do business. And so they came to fear the very thing that they now most need: an enfolding, restorative, and profoundly understanding tenderness toward their traumatized early selves. In a grim paradox, to have words of empathy whispered to them lovingly in the dark only reinforces their deepest fears; their protective shell snaps ever more tightly shut at the approach of sympathetic love; they respond to their own needs with panic and self-disgust.</p>
<p>We learn to be vulnerable by understanding that those who conveyed the imperative of a tougher—non-crying, non-fragile, loving—self were profoundly incorrect and, in their own way, deeply traumatized. Mommy was dismissive of our fears not because she was impressively astute in her theories of human development but because she was struggling with her own history of unattended need. The anti-Minko “friend” wasn’t showing us the real path to being a grown-up but inflicting on us some of the unkindness that had in other contexts been directed at them. We need to go back and convince ourselves—perhaps with a touch of anger—of how misguided the agents of our “growing up” really were.</p>
<p>Finding a partner with whom we can be vulnerable constitutes a supreme act of restoration. After a lifetime of denial and false strength, we stand to find in another the sympathy that was sorely needed but unavailable to us in the past. The old wounds can be gently tended; we become stronger by learning to speak the language of weakness. By letting our hurt, mentally fragile selves into the relationship, we open the way to a more nuanced, fruitful, creative, and accurate way of being an adult.</p>
<p>(III) TENDERNESS</p>
<p>Love has a third important but not always easily recognized ingredient: tenderness. Tenderness often gets overlooked because what it really involves is compassion at the very moment when compassion isn’t obviously deserved. Relationships succeed when it is precisely a partner’s less edifying and unworthy behaviors that remain capable of arousing, alongside a deep sigh, doses of unearned redemptive empathy.</p>
<p>In theory, we all have plenty of time for compassion, but we tend to have some specific notions of where and when this quality should really be deployed. We typically reserve it for the most obviously blameless candidates: those who are sad but entirely good, those who have lost their livelihoods through no fault of their own, those who were born into unfortunate circumstances, struck by lightning or rendered homeless by earthquakes.</p>
<p>What we find much harder to do is to forgive someone who appears to be behaving suboptimally on purpose, who seems to have made an active choice to mess things up, who looks as if they have taken a negative path out of wilfulness, idiocy, or nastiness; someone who had options to be successful or respectable, calm or grown up, but instead—for reasons we have no energy to investigate—decided to shout, to be mean, to respond ungratefully or to display immaturity. We know we are kind people, but we surely cannot be expected to love where love is undeserved.</p>
<p>And yet that is exactly where love should and must be deployed if relationships are to survive. True love cannot be directed solely toward those who are admirable and virtuous. It has to soften our judgments in relation to people who are at points undeniably maddening and plainly wrong.</p>
<p>A way to conceive of love is as a willingness to look beyond the obvious damning grounds for bad behavior in search of deeper, more forgivable reasons why someone messed up. We see this most clearly in the way that a good-enough parent loves a child. When a three-year-old throws a tantrum and pushes their dinner plate on the floor, scattering pasta everywhere, a parent knows not to slap their offspring and declare them “evil.” The parent will search for reasons why their child acted as they did. Perhaps they have sore gums. Maybe they are extremely tired. Perhaps their rivalrous feelings toward a sibling have reached a pitch. The parent searches for something other than sheer “badness” to explain a departure from good sense and decorum.</p>
<p>A little of this curiosity and empathy should, with caveats and boundaries, enter our adult relationships as well. Here, too, there will be plenty of occasions when we cannot easily imagine why our partner acted as they did: their moodiness seems to have no rationale; there can be no blameless explanation for the way they spoke to our friend; nothing seems capable of excusing their persistent lateness . . .</p>
<p>But though outrage may feel liberating, it is no friend of love. In order to stand any chance of working, a relationship has to involve—on both sides—a continuous attempt to drill beneath difficult words and actions in search of their more complicated, and occasionally touching, origins. Perhaps our partner is feeling sexually insecure; maybe they are unduly threatened by a friend’s financial success because they were never allowed to believe that they could matter in themselves. It’s possible that persistent lateness is a protest against a bullying, coercive, time-obsessed parent . . . Someone may often be a pain—and yet still be worthy of a lot of thought and kindness.</p>
<p>At the core of the tender person’s outlook is a simple-sounding but love-sustaining fact: they treat the other as no less fragile, flawed, and sensitive than they remember themselves to be—only around slightly different things. Tenderness taps modestly and perceptively into self-knowledge.</p>
<p>When love is tender, two partners can together develop an impetus for change: the most easily bruised parts of who they are can dare to be exposed because they know that the other’s touch will be gentle. The things we despaired of anyone understanding about us become, at last, possible to admit to. The strange, sweet aspects of our complicated, troubled minds open up to being explored and accepted in all their lonely oddity and shame.</p>
<p>(IV) A THERAPEUTIC ATTITUDE</p>
<p>To state it boldly, and to risk sounding a bit strange, all good lovers are in a way good psychotherapists: that is, the success of modern romantic relationships critically depends on the degree to which both partners can, at crucial moments, adopt a therapeutic attitude toward the other’s compulsions, blind spots, rages, and eccentricities.</p>
<p>This sounds odd to say because we usually see therapy as something only a professional could do in a consulting room after years of training, not as anything that we and a partner might be able to offer one another in the kitchen, the bedroom, or over a cocktail in a small but rather elegant bar.</p>
<p>Yet if we drill down into the true nature of psychotherapy our perspective changes. At base, the discipline relies on a theory about how emotional life works. Powerful emotions, therapy says, are triggered in the present by traumas and difficulties that began in a distant and usually largely forgotten past.</p>
<p>The essence of psychotherapy lies in a willingness to get systematically interested in why we constantly respond in the bizarre and uncalled-for ways we exhibit. It asks by what sequence of formative experiences an otherwise perfectly decent and intelligent person could be led to sob on the floor or threaten to jump out of the window after an argument. It’s less disturbed by a tantrum, a sulk, or a cold withdrawal than curious about where such over-or under-reactions might be coming from.</p>
<p>In therapy, there is always a good—and often moving story—about why someone ends up shouting “Fuck off” to the person they most love or gets icily dismissive when another is pleading for warmth. Perhaps far back, in the old house decades ago, there were genuine, urgent emotional terrors that had to be countered by aggression or evaded by massive psychological withdrawal. While the body has grown, the deep patterns of the mind have stayed the same, so that one now reacts not to what is presently happening but to an old threat that has been unknowingly re-evoked. The brutish words or cold facade are, when the logic of the mind is properly disentangled, directed not at a partner but at a carer, parent, or rival in a now hazy, convoluted back story.</p>
<p>In the consulting room, disturbed feelings can gradually be repatriated so that we no longer unleash them, haphazardly, on whomever happens to be most prominent in our lives. We grow appropriately therapeutic when we can be genuinely interested in the long history that might be standing behind the least alluring and at times appalling emotional conduct of which we and our partners are capable. As therapeutically minded lovers, we no longer always ask why they are being so horrible to us, we try to work out what other people might long ago have done to and around them.</p>
<p>We realize that we’ve come along late in the history of others’ souls. They are fighting emotional battles that commenced many years before they could have suspected our existence. They had dug themselves into defensive positions or honed their offensive tactics—to which we are now exposed—by the time they were mastering the eight times table. It isn’t their fault. They didn’t ask to have the childhood they did, they coped as best they could, and now we are simply the haphazard targets for their largely unconscious, albeit often genuinely off-putting, strategies of defense.</p>
<p>Along the way, psychotherapy teaches us that direct confrontation is seldom a good idea. A therapist might know, pretty much from day one, what a client is suffering from. They might have a solid thesis that the client is mentally scrambled because their mother’s abundant love carried with it a secret command that they must never acknowledge any sexual feelings. Or that they are paranoid because of their father’s displays of violence and cruelty. What counts, though, isn’t that the therapist has developed an accurate diagnosis but that the patient is allowed to recognize it for themselves, by a process of carefully designed prompts, in a way that they can absorb without fear, in their own time. That is why therapists tend to proceed via gentle questions—“I wonder how it felt when Mom went away”—instead of blanket assertions: “Let me tell you why you are so messed up.”</p>
<p>In relationships, too, therapeutic kindness should mean avoiding direct lectures on the issues we sense in our partners. We try—on a good day—not to say: “I’ve seen through you, I know what’s wrong with you—and why you are running away from me as you are.” And we strive instead to nudge the other toward greater self-knowledge at a pace they can benefit from. There are no prizes for trying to initiate others into varieties of self-awareness they have no strength for.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in relationships that work well, the burden of analytic interpretation never falls on only one person; we’re both prepared to see each other through an even-tempered therapeutic lens. We can mutually promise: “I’ll be less frightened of what’s disturbed yet disguised in you, if you can begin to imagine doing the same for me and my foibles.”</p>
<p>Everyone, during the close-up, prolonged inspection all relationships entail, is sure to reveal themselves as being substantially disturbed. Which is why we so much want and need to be with someone who grasps, with reference to the complexities of our early emotional lives, the essential normality of our oddities. They might win our hearts by saying, on an early date: “I’ll tell you about how mad I am, and where it all began, if you’ll tell me how crazy you are, and how Mom and Dad messed you up.” We’ll thereby be deploying the possibilities of a therapeutically minded perspective to help secure the long-term sympathetic love we are looking for.</p>
<p>(V) ENTHUSIASM</p>
<p>When relationships start, enthusiasm for our partners tends to be at a pitch. We think of them constantly, we want only to spend more time in their company, we delight in their many skills and accomplishments. We can’t quite get over the way they know how to glide on a dance floor, prepare such tasty soups, read interesting novels, sweet-talk our hard-to-please mother, or calmly perform a life-saving operation on an ailing horse or poodle.</p>
<p>But this early phase of powerful admiration and longing rarely lasts. A few years in, our partner may still be an administrative whizz, a stylish dancer, a good cook, a knowledgeable thinker, a fixed favorite of our mother, or a superlative vet—and yet we now find it hard to feel or express too much wonderment. A sullenness has taken hold of us that does not lift. There is, somewhere deep inside us, a gigantic, stubborn “but . . .”</p>
<p>The corrosion of romantic enthusiasm is one of the grand, intimate, tragic, and rarely told stories of love. It seems to happen almost without our noticing; we gradually slip into a position of no longer being able to admire very much. With time, we may feel loyal to the union we’ve built; we may harbor a deep friendship toward our partner—we’d give them a kidney; but we can’t relish and celebrate their merits as we once did.</p>
<p>The world often explains this cooling as a sheer and inevitable result of exposure. It is, they say, typical to neglect what is always around. But the true reasons seem more complicated, more psychologically rich and, in their own way, a lot more hopeful.</p>
<p>If we stop admiring, it is not because we are ever really bored or because it is “normal” to take someone for granted; it is chiefly only because we are, at some level, furious. Anger creeps into love and destroys admiration. We cease to delight because we unknowingly grow entangled in various forms of unprocessed annoyance. We can’t cheer them on because, somewhere deep inside, we are inhibited by trace memories of certain let-downs, large and small, of which they have been guilty without their knowing. Perhaps they caused us immense difficulties around a work crisis—and never apologized. Maybe they flirted with a friend of ours—and left us feeling tricked and unsure. They may have booked a vacation without asking us—and then insisted that they’d done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>None of these infractions was, on its own, necessarily particularly serious, but taken cumulatively a succession of minor disappointments can acquire a terrible capacity to dampen and ultimately destroy ardor. Yet it is not the simple fact of being let down that counts very much; the true problem is created when there hasn’t been an opportunity to process our disappointment. Irritation is only toxic when it hasn’t been extensively and thoughtfully aired.</p>
<p>Perhaps we tried to explain what was wrong but we got nowhere. Our partner lost their temper and we gave up. Or, more subtly, we might have felt unentitled to make a fuss over so-called “small things” and therefore stayed silent even though, in our depths, the small things mattered immensely to us. With great unfairness to our partner, we may have forgotten to admit to our own sensitivities even as we developed a steady burden of resentment against their unknowing offenses.</p>
<p>What follows from such buried anger is something that can be mistaken for lack of interest but is in substance very different. We no longer want to celebrate their birthday, we withhold sexual attention, we don’t look up when they walk into a room. This could seem like the normal impact of time and proximity. But it is no such thing. It is evidence of cold fury. We do our anger an honor, and can start to dismantle its deleterious impacts, when we recognize the full impact of unexamined frustration on our emotions. We never simply go off people; we only ever get very angry with them. And then forget we are so.</p>
<p>To refind our instinctive enthusiasm for our partner, we need to accurately locate our suppressed distress. We have to allow ourselves to be legitimately upset about certain things that have saddened us and then raise them—for as long as we need to—in a way that lets us feel acknowledged and valued. Because anger inflicts an ever-increasing toll the longer it is left unaddressed, a good couple should allow for regular occasions when each person can—without encountering opposition—ask the other to listen to incidents, large or small, in which they felt let down of late. There might be an evening a week left free for this form of “processing.” The mission should be bluntly known to both parties: an opportunity to pick up on areas in which we feel let down—not, we should add, in the name of killing love but rather to ensure its ongoing buoyancy. It goes without saying that we might not immediately see why a given thing should matter so much to our partner; but that isn’t the point. The object of the exercise is not to listen to complaints that seem utterly relatable to us; it is to let our partner know that we care because these are problems to them.</p>
<p>To ensure that our desire never suffers, this kind of hygienic ritual might be placed at the center of every relationship. If couples too often ignore the requirement, it is because they operate under an unfair burden of bravery: they are far more susceptible than they let themselves think. They assume that it cannot be sane to get “upset” so often, to experience so much hurt, to be so easily ruffled. They can’t summon the courage to make a complaint about things that they don’t even admit to themselves have caused a sting—and so stay silent until it is no longer possible for them to feel. Wiser couples know that nothing should ever be too small to cover at length, for what is ultimately at stake in a marathon conversation about a single word or a minuscule event in the hallway can be the fate of the entire relationship. These lovers are in this sense like wise parents who, when a child is sorrowful, are patient enough to enter into the imaginative realm of the child and take the time to find out just how upsetting it was that there was a loud bang in the street or that one of Nounou’s eyes came off. They will devote three and a quarter hours to understanding why a partner got silently immensely upset by the way we said the word “ready” to them at breakfast the day before or how it felt to them when we were a touch slow at laughing along with a mildly unfunny story they shared about a train and a suitcase at dinner with our aunt. The gratitude that will flow from such an effort to understand them will be amply repaid the next time we feel abandoned because they forgot to put the lid back on the olives or omitted to add a second x at the end of an email.</p>
<p>To complain in love is a noble and honorable skill very far removed from the category of whininess with which it is sometimes confused. The irony of well-targeted and quickly raised complaints is that their function is entirely positive. Honesty is a love-preserving mechanism that keeps alive all that is impressive and delightful about our partner in our eyes. By regularly voicing our small sorrows and minor irritations, we are scraping the barnacles off the keel of our relationship and thereby ensuring that we will sail on with continued joy and admiration into an authentic and unresentful future.</p>
<p>2 Love and Psychotherapy</p>
<p>Lovers and psychotherapists might, at first glance, seem to have very little to teach one another, but an unexpected way of helping our relationships to flourish can be to study how therapists speak to, and approach the troubles of, their patients. The truths of psychotherapy don’t belong only to clinical practice; they have widespread application in the bedroom and especially outside the bathroom door at midnight during heated arguments about ostensibly very little. When relationships get difficult, as they invariably will, therapeutic ideas can give us ways to understand and cope sympathetically with many of the stranger parts of ourselves and our partners.</p>
<p>The following therapeutic ideas can prove of particular relevance.</p>
