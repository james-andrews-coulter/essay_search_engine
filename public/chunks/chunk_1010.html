        <h2>THE PARTY</h2>
<p>It is an option to throw a great party to say thank you to those who have come and witnessed the wedding. But it’s not only a thank you – the point of the party is to help embed the principles of a good marriage, for yourselves, and for everyone who attends.</p>
<p>i. Conversation menu</p>
<p>When the guests are seated, they should be invited to have a special kind of conversation. Instead of simply chatting, they should discuss the nature and purpose of love. A conversation menu is provided alongside each plate. Every guest has to ask and answer the menu with at least one of their fellow guests.</p>
<p>Candid answers are almost certain to reveal how normal it is for good relationships to be difficult: this will help correct an overly rosy sense of what is usual and create a more reliable benchmark for our own experiences.</p>
