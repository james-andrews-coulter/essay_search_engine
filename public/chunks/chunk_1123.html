        <h2>Paris</h2>
<p>One of the finest therapeutic activities we can undertake in cities is also one of the simplest and the most readily available: going out for g walk. In mid-19th-century Paris, this activity was for the first time accorded a name. To wander the city was to be a fldneur, someone who ambled down boulevards and explored side streets, not to get anywhere in particular, but for the sheer pleasure of being able to see their fellow citizens, of all ages and classes, running errands, taking children to school, meeting business associates and perhaps conducting a love affair or plotting a murder. The fl@neurs were protesting against the pressure to look vacantly down at their feet and pretend that they were all alone in the city: their curiosity was correcting the alienation of our hurried, solipsistic modern age. At the very dawn of the mass entertainment industry, the flaneurs were insisting that nothing could rival the novelistic pleasures of discreetly studying strangers in the street.
Paris lent itself particularly well to the wanderings of the flaneurs. Its broad boulevards, pavement cafés, covered arcades and compact parks immediately brought them into contact with a varied cast of characters around which speculations could take form. In the 1960s, the flaneur acquired a camera: what became known as ‘street photography’ added a recording mechanism to capture the contingent beauty and interest of the urban theatre. In 1969, Garry Winogrand, arguably the greatest street photographer the world has yet known, made a trip to Paris from his native New York. His image of a café in Montparnasse immediately invites us to imagine the stories that might be at play. The man in the polo neck, the Pampered son of an industrialist doing a degree in hermeneutics at the Sorbonne, has just asked the woman in white, who was recently left by her Dutch boyfriend and had solemnly taken a decision not to trust men for a long while, if it would be OK for him to sit next to her, The woman on the right has pretended not to notice and doesn’t often get approached by men (but might be off to meet her civil service lover, twice her age, in an apartment nearby). The waiter, an excitable man who could have been a boxer when younger, chiefly doesn’t want trouble, unless we’re looking for a table?
We don’t need very much to start the game: a face is enough, and no more than a few seconds. Some of the pleasure comes from a recognition that we are not alone with our dilemmas and sufferings. Alone in our room, we may feel like the only ones in trouble; out on the street, we see that life spares nobody their share of anxiety and disarray. We are drawn out of ourselves; our problems diminish in scale, relativised by the old man crossing the street painfully slowly or the disabled woman patiently feeding a pigeon. There are multiple opportunities, too, to fall in love; not the sort of love that will result in marriage and children and long domestic evenings squabbling about where to spend the holidays, but the idyllic, weightless, boundless sort of love that comes powerfully to mind when we pass a beautiful, intelligent face at a junction and imagine being allowed up to their apartment and there coming to understand the origins of their sadness, stroking their arm gently as they describe the early death of their beloved father and their aspirations to paint abstract canvases or write a book of poems.</p>
