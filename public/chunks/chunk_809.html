        <h2>REPETITION</h2>
<p>Our minds don’t just need good lessons, they need to learn good habits: that is, they need to fashion routines in which helpful rituals, activities, and ideas are repeated until they become second nature. Like someone learning a new language, we need to go over certain points again and again, rehearsing notions of self-love, self-forgiveness, kindness, and self-acceptance on a daily basis. Things are so slow because we aren’t just trying to acquire intellectual concepts—something that might need only a minute—we’re trying to alter our personalities. It will be a life’s work.</p>
