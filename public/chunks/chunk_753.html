        <h3>Awe at the complexity</h3>
<p>The more we have imbibed an impression that a good relationship is a birthright, the more we will be catapulted into frustration by whatever struggles we encounter. And yet the more we can have faith that this is – at times, by necessity – a nightmare for everyone, the more we will be kind to ourselves and our maddening partners and may, eventually, laugh. We need not compound our problems by believing that they are – on top of everything else – unusual. They are par for the course. We are stumbling around, lost and furious, hurt and sad, exactly the way we are meant to. There was never going to be an alternative. Our problems aren’t a sign that we have made a mistake; they’re evidence that we’re properly engaging with the process. This is love. The songs and the movies have got it very wrong. Only a few books will ever dare to whisper how it is.</p>
<p>A serious relationship is an attempt by two people to be happy together forever. Simply rereading that sentence should make us laugh (sometimes scream). If there were a god above able to listen to our blather, they would guffaw or send us a few hurricanes to tame our hubris. What cosmic impudence! What profound misunderstanding of the material of which we’re made! Most of us can’t manage fifteen minutes of satisfaction on our own; and somehow we have managed to hallucinate that we might double up and bank forty-five years of contentment side by side, perhaps with two children, a dog, a cramped home, a busy career and a range of ever-increasing physical ailments. We are truly being very nasty to ourselves.</p>
<p>We would have a lot more reason to smile if only we could be more pessimistic. There should be lessons in melancholy about love in primary school. We assess how we’re doing at any task relative to an overarching sense of how complex it might be. If we think a journey should take half an hour, we go half wild with frustration when we’re still only at the starting gate at lunchtime, but if we imagine the trip will take an entire day, maybe two, we’ll be delighted by the incremental progress we’re making. An ideally wise society would constantly correctly signpost the arduousness of love: a relationship would be framed as the almost impossible task of coordinating the emotional and practical existences of two necessarily insane individuals of different backgrounds, tastes, ways of thinking and patterns of feeling, both attempting to grasp for satisfaction against the mutual clash of their complex, demented histories and the ticking of the clock towards painful eternal demise.</p>
<p>There will be no way this will ever go smoothly just because we have (at key moments) been very fond of one another. Wedding speeches should resemble send-offs for adventurers about to cross Antarctica or colonise Mars; ritual wailing and lamentation would most rightly accompany all announcements of marriage.</p>
