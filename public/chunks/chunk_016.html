            <h3>3. Shyness</h3>
<p>One of the great errors we can fall into when we set out to make friends is to trust that the way people first present themselves to us – in those tense early moments at a party or in the workplace, in a holiday resort or a lecture hall – is the sum total of who they are.</p>
<p>We start to get shy and unnecessarily inhibited when we assume that a social front – a construct marked by a blend of seriousness, optimism, stiffness and fakery – is the truth about what other humans are actually like; when we side with the outward presentation of others over what we know of ourselves, namely, that we are within our depths all highly vulnerable, silly, funny, weird, desperate and sad creatures longing for affection and never far from chaos.</p>
<p>We cease to be warm or authentic when we double down on efforts to fit in with a model of decorum to which we see others subscribing. We get locked into interactions in which everyone’s presentational self is taken by others to be the truth of who they are. Everyone lies and, even worse, everyone gets taken in by everyone else’s lies – and eventually even their own.</p>
<p>Often, no one is having a good time in their relationships – and yet somehow everyone colludes to suggest that there might be such a thing as happy love. Everyone is miserable at work and yet everyone is busy sharing stories of their latest triumphs and progress, and thereby denying public recognition of the universal compromises and pains of careers. Everyone is breaking down in tears and crying wildly into their pillows at night, and yet still the chatter is about options for happiness and success. In a more minor key, everyone is sitting down for a tedious three-course meal when, in reality, it would be so much more fun to cook some scrambled eggs and go dancing.</p>
<p>The person who founders in friendship goes along with the lies. They assume that what they feel has no echo in others. They imagine that other people inside are the way they come across outside. They don’t keep faith that these companions have just fallen into a straightjacketed way of living and are longing to be released, if only they knew how.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the bold acquaintance, the person with a natural manner and a gift for friendship, uses themselves as a guide to social reality and conduct. They know that they are bored at the dinner party – and dare to guess that on this basis many other people will be too. They know that the prizewinning novel was pretentious and they have the wherewithal to assume that they won’t be the only ones to feel this way. They operate with the idea that most of what is going on in them will, despite an absence of immediate evidence, be going on inside other people too. They know they cannot be the exceptions; they refuse to trust – where it counts – in their own originality. They know that their madness and silliness, playfulness and impatience belong to everyone.</p>
<p>Their honesty can lend them a gift for comedy. They smoke out others’ secrets when declaring their truths – and generate relieved laughter in the process. They say that they fancy the president or the shopkeeper and everyone giggles because their own unacknowledged desires have been tickled along the way. They express hatred for a fashionable political cause – and allow everyone to admit that they have long felt this way too.</p>
<p>Like a shy person, a socially liberated one knows they are odd. Where the latter differs is in being sure that everyone else is as well. The art of making friends is based on a sure sense that others are not as alien as they might seem; on losing some of our shame and more boldly picturing that our unusual-sounding insides have corollaries in strangers; on accepting that we are, in the best and most redemptive of ways, far from unique.</p>
