            <h4>2. Do Something Enjoyable Alone</h4>
<p>The most commonly offered reason for not doing something like regular exercise is ‘I don’t have the time . . .’ Often this is a pretty transparent excuse
  (‘I don’t have time to go to the doctor, but I do have time to play computer games’). But in fact many of us do live extremely busy and pressured lives, and particularly if we
  share a home with others, find it difficult to see where yet another clump of hours can be fitted into a life which feels, and perhaps is, already short of them.</p>
<p>This is a genuine difficulty in relation to solitude, because it is too easy to think of it as a ‘new’ sort of time, which will have to be carved out of other activities. Usually we
  cannot choose whether we are alone at work, so if we want to experiment with solitude it seems as though it will have to be in our ‘spare’ or leisure time. But as a society we have
  constructed leisure as predominantly a communal activity. People who indulge in solitary hobbies are treated as ‘odd’, if not contemptible: ‘geeks’, ‘nerds’,
  ‘anoraks’ – trainee ‘loners’, in all likelihood!</p>
<p>There are some popular leisure activities which cannot be enjoyed alone – team sports are an obvious example, as are Scottish reel dancing, board games and gossip. The activities that can
  only be enjoyed alone form a smaller but significant group – reading being perhaps the most obvious one. But there are a very large number that can be, and often are, done either in a group
  or alone, like listening to or making music, walking, gardening and watching TV.</p>
<p>It is interesting, occasionally, to look in detail at how one does actually spend one’s leisure time – within the working week, during non-working days like weekends and on holiday.
  Such a list, made honestly, usually shows us just how much time we waste doing nothing in particular at all – ‘neither what we want nor what we ought,’ as C. S. Lewis described
  it. But more importantly it reveals that most of us have a pretty clear division between ‘work’ and ‘leisure’. This distinction is a strong feature of post-industrial
  societies and simply did not exist before that. It is a common belief that so-called ‘advanced societies’ have more leisure than people used to have – but anthropologists now
  recognize that hunter-gatherer societies have the most leisure and that ‘down time’ is one of the biggest losses of modernity. Even in mediaeval Europe the peasant had far more holidays
  than a middle-class salaried worker has now.</p>
<p>As well as reducing our leisure hours, modern societies have also massively increased the amount of ‘maintenance’ time we feel is essential for all that washing and cleaning and
  grooming and decorating – ourselves and our homes. This is partly because we have separated ‘work’ and ‘maintenance’: a great deal of necessary maintenance now takes
  double the time to perform, because first we have to work to earn the money that enables us to do the task. If you are living by subsistence agriculture you might barter to some extent, but you
  never need to go shopping. It is also partly because over the last couple of centuries we have raised and elaborated our ideas of necessary maintenance: far from providing more leisure
  time, labour-saving domestic devices have made a higher standard of cleanliness obligatory – a daily bath or shower, daily clean underwear, regular changes of bedding, frequent hair-washing
  and so on – unknown to even prosperous households a century ago.</p>
<p>But the real reason why maintenance takes more time is because we own so many more things, all of which need maintaining. We work longer hours to buy the things, and then we spend more hours
  managing and looking after them, and so as we become money-richer we also become more leisure-poor.</p>
<p>We are leisure-poor, then, because the combined burden of work and maintenance takes up so much of our time and because we have compartmentalized the three activities. Moreover, in addition to
  compartmentalizing them in time, we have also divided them in space – we use an increasing amount of our day to move between the locations where the three things take place. There are other
  ways to be.</p>
<p>I live on a high moor in south-west Scotland. Not much flourishes here except black-face ‘free range’ sheep. Like many infertile upland areas it got left behind in the years after
  the 1939–45 war. There was no electricity until 1972; the thirteen miles of un-metalled single-track road between one village and the next had thirteen gates which had to be opened and
  closed. Each farm was isolated from its neighbours – and most people worked alone. Every summer, though, they had Common Shearing: five or six farms would get together and shear all the
  sheep, farm by farm; the shearers sitting in a circle on shearing stools, chatting and singing as they worked. The whole family from each farm would come, and whosever farm the shearing was at that
  day fed everyone. All the older people in this glen remember Common Shearing as a social activity, even though hand-shearing is hard work and an economic necessity. Electricity, as well as a
  sharply declining population, ended Common Shearing – power-shears are too fast and also too noisy for sociability. Work and leisure are no longer seamless.</p>
<p>Even in mediaeval Europe the peasant had far more holidays than a middle-class salaried worker has now.</p>
<p>Life patterns like this have had a long-term influence on our ideas about ‘leisure’. When people worked alone, or with a tiny and unchanging group like the family, and leisure and
  work were more closely entwined than they now are – markets (work) were also fairs (leisure) – hours spent not alone were social occasions in predominantly solitary lives. So leisure
  became associated with group activities and with sociability. Most of our team and competitive sports evolved from local and traditional games; much of our preferred music (the orchestra, the
  group, the choir) likewise emerged from communal activity. Even the word ‘holiday’ is derived from the concept of Holy Days, when mediaeval peasants did not have to perform work duties
  but did have to go to church – a profoundly corporate event.</p>
<p>Now most of us do not work alone. We do not even work in the noisy dangerous places that so isolated individual workers in nineteenth-century factories. But still when we think about
  ‘leisure’ in our time-stressed, noisy lives, we tend to think of social rather than solitary activities; and think there is simply no space, once we have built in work, maintenance and
  ‘leisure’, for time to be alone.</p>
<p>This is why it is worth rethinking the leisure you already enjoy and seeing if there are ways of increasing your time alone within that framework. This has the additional advantage of relieving
  some of the anxiety about solitude by associating it with an activity you already know you enjoy.</p>
<p>Common Shearing was a social activity, even though hand-shearing was hard work and an economic necessity.</p>
<p>Running alone can allow you to hit the mute button on the world [. . .] and take full advantage of exercise’s stress-busting benefits. ‘Running alone can be a
    meditative experience where you get to really think and concentrate or completely clear your mind and zone out,’ [a psychotherapist, Michelle] Maidenberg says. [. . .] ‘You have to
    practise letting go of the inner chatter that can get in the way of what you want to accomplish,’ [sports psychologist Cindra Kamphoff says]. ‘And that’s something you have to
    do on your own.’</p>
<p>(Runner’s World, March 2013)</p>
<p>Jogging as a physical discipline was really only established in the 1960s. (1968 saw the first use of the noun ‘jogger’, in New Zealand.) This may explain why it is
  one of the few leisure activities that it is normal to see people doing alone: it was a response to the symptoms of modernity I have been describing, and so free of the residual ‘leisure as
  social’ culture that preceded it. But in fact it is perfectly possible to do many other activities – outdoors and in – alone: go to the cinema, an art gallery or up a mountain;
  fishing, gardening.</p>
<p>Reading and listening to music (or even playing an instrument) are obvious leisure activities which people do alone; but they do present an odd question. When you read, are you alone? When you
  listen to music – particularly vocal music – is that a solitary activity? Or is it something you are doing in the company of the writer, the composer or the singers?</p>
<p>Sara, coming home.</p>
<p>And above all, walking. For me, solitary walking, especially but by no means exclusively in wilder places, feels like a necessity as well as a joy. Solitary walking is a profound image of
  independence and personal integrity. This makes it a good way to start exploring solitude; it is hard, when walking, not to feel good about yourself and about your capacity to be alone. In addition
  it is available to almost everyone (you just walk a shorter distance if you are less fit), extremely cheap and embellished with happy associations with creativity, health and pleasure.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that doing things alone intensifies the emotional experience; sharing an experience immediately appears to dissipate our emotional responses, as though
  communicating it drained away the visceral sensation. I walk a good deal alone and my own experience is that this is very different from walking – even the same walks – in company. I
  see and notice more and experience both the environment and my physical response to it in a very clear direct way. I also like walking with other people and do that too. The freedom to walk alone,
  to eat alone, to travel alone, gives at the very least a wider potential pleasure. I would feel deprived if both were not possible for me.</p>
