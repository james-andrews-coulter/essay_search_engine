        <h2>Pills &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Our culture is not only keen for us to find happiness, but it is also – on many occasions – distinctly intolerant of sorrowful moods. If we start to get down, it may seek to change the subject, recommend a thrilling film, encourage us to go skiing or show us something sugary or shiny. And if our state of mind were to remain gloomy, we would then be directed towards a psychiatrist who would play with our serotonin levels and aim to return us as quickly as possible to a state in which we would be able to join in with team sports, go to the office and honour our families and our duties to the state.</p>
<p>Psychiatric drugs have – in certain circumstances – offered major breakthroughs. The worry is not so much a society that wants to help us with our sadness as one that cannot, beneath the surface, abide that we should sometimes legitimately need to weep.</p>
<p>One of the routine assumptions made about babies is that they should always and invariably be up for a laugh. A certain kind of stranger who visits may, therefore, rigidly try to get a giggle out of them, by jangling keys, pulling extreme faces or starting a game of peekaboo. It seems a well meaning thing to do, but babies – like adults – often have weighty and serious things on their minds. They might, at a given moment, be missing the womb or wondering when the next feed might be, trying to work out what a leaf is or reflecting on how a button is held in place. A ‘jollying’ grown-up isn’t simply happy; their particular sickness is that they cannot tolerate unhappiness in others, even an eight-month-old, because it threatens to highlight areas of grief that they have not processed or learnt to absorb in themselves. The baby’s thoughtful face is at risk of evoking for them important people they have lost and regrets they have never come to terms with – and so the keys get jangled with ever greater ferocity.</p>
<p>A whole culture can, at scale, fall prey to a form of denied pain that passes itself off as good cheer. It may spend its time promoting vigour and triumph and leave aside how much in the life of everyone is also about loss, vulnerability and regret. In its eagerness to present a smiling face, a culture can fail to nurture rituals in which sadness can be mutualised, periods of nationwide mourning where a lot that is individually difficult can find collective expression and catharsis.</p>
<p>For example, birthdays shouldn’t be framed – at the group level – purely as occasions for joy. They should be moments when what is incomplete can be confronted and sympathised with, in company. Mother’s Day or Father’s Day shouldn’t be about sheer gratitude and delight; these days must also allow for ambivalence and anger (sometimes even fury), for only thereafter can expressions of love feel genuine. Likewise, family holidays should never be presented as moments of total festivity; they are times when we must be able to squabble, sulk and face up to what is radically imperfect about where we have come from. Rather than being squeamish about difficulties, an intelligent culture holds our hand through, and helps us to name, the sad regions of life.</p>
<p>Zacharias Dolendo,Saturn as Melancholy, 1595</p>
<p>By being too quick to prescribe pills for sadness, a culture is at risk of missing the necessary nature of melancholy. The melancholic doesn’t need ‘solutions’ to their pain so much as an opportunity to share its details with people who are kind, non-judgemental and a little broken themselves. They want pain to be normalised; company around sadness is the chief ‘solution’ they need. Pills deny the melancholic the chance to address the isolation that lurks behind their sad moods.</p>
<p>By framing the melancholic as ‘ill’ and separating them from the rest of humanity, medical culture offers no lasting help to those it seeks to treat. Previous eras, though they might have been less medically gifted, were more psychologically canny. In a charming and emotionally intelligent fable, they allowed those subject to black moods to tell others that they had been born under the sign of Saturn and, because of the influence of this planet, would not always be up for joining in the singing, coming out to parties or chatting merrily. They weren’t ill, and they weren’t mad. They were just in a ‘saturnine phase’ and hoped to feel a bit better soon.</p>
<p>By avidly prescribing pills for sadness, we are hinting that sadness does not belong within a decent life. Far more than any pill, what we crave in our melancholy state is a warm-hearted community that understands the sorrows of life and is kind enough to allow us to sit with our feelings for as long as they may require to pass.</p>
