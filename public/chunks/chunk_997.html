        <h4>4. Not Choosing</h4>
<p>I believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more so, if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor, upon a due consideration of characters and
      circumstances, without the parties having any choice in the matter.</p>
<p>(ATTRIBUTED TO SAMUEL JOHNSON, BOSWELL, THE
      LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON)</p>
<p>If you agree with Samuel Johnson, you’re in a minority. Most people deeply believe that the best life outcomes are created by active and informed decisions. More, that if
  we ourselves don’t make those decisions, we give up the chance of those best outcomes; we surrender control, cede responsibility and in so doing resign ourselves to compromise – as well
  as tacitly admitting that we’re not up to the task of managing our own lives.</p>
<p>But let me argue the opposite. Maybe Johnson is right, and letting go of choice is a good idea. It’s not just that love is one of the few areas in modern society where we may still cling
  to romantic notions of fate determining our future. But also, by handing over control to others, we might avoid repeating past mistakes or making new and future ones. When dealing with
  ‘winged Cupid painted blind’, as Shakespeare put it, taking our own blind prejudices out of the equation may be no bad thing.</p>
<p>Heads or tails?</p>
<p>Opt to step back from active decision-making, and the first possibility open to us is to toss a coin. When it comes to deciding a lifelong commitment, doing that literally may
  not seem wise, though devotees of the I Ching might disagree. A friend of mine did once use the system to decide whether to marry her boyfriend; the coins said ‘no’, which in hindsight
  proved to be excellent advice. And in Luke Rhinehart’s The Dice Man – as its title suggests, a novel about a man who makes all choices thus guided – several
  partner-decisions are made that way. The result is whole-scale erotic abandonment under the absolving aphorism ‘Who am I to question the dice?’</p>
<p>Let’s consider next the American psychologist Barry Schwartz, whose work focusses on the reasoning behind choice. His argument is that randomness is a ‘good enough’ option.
  Once certain standards are met – we like each other well enough, we have similar life goals, we’ve checked issues such as substance abuse and criminal record – there are really no
  good reasons to discriminate between one suitor and the next. Chance, Schwartz suggests, might well be the ‘most efficient’ but also the ‘fairest . . . most honest’
  option.</p>
<p>Interesting ideas, though most of us are wary of making key life decisions with so little information. Which is why I don’t advise either coin-tossing, dice-throwing or absolute
  randomness. But I do suggest that to circumvent our biases and introduce a little serendipity, daters should, online, approach one random person in every twenty profiles they access, and offline be
  open to the occasional blind date, opportunity dinner from a colleague or fortuitous encounter at the supermarket checkout. Randomness certainly can open a different, less blinkered and therefore
  sometimes better door.</p>
<p>Destiny vs growth</p>
<p>The issue of fortuitous encounters brings us to an interesting double standard here. We may recoil in horror at the thought of haphazard chance determining our future life
  partner, but label that chance ‘destiny’ and we’re entranced by the prospect. On the one hand we feel the need to be in control of our romantic choices; on the other hand the
  thought of losing control can be hugely seductive.</p>
<p>Enter Professor ‘Chip’ Knee of the University of Houston, and his work on ‘destiny love’, his term for the conviction held by some couples that kismet rather than
  coincidence brought them together. Believe this, and we are likely to feel strongly and instantly attracted to a partner, the relationship is likely to be passionate and intense, and a magical
  certainty of success is likely to hover over the whole enterprise. As a perfect example, see that scene in the film Sleepless in Seattle where Sam Baldwin describes meeting his first wife,
  speaks so movingly of taking her hand to help her out of a car, and – just with that initial touch – realizes ‘we were supposed to be together . . . and I knew it.’</p>
<p>Sam Baldwin was lucky – thanks to a good scriptwriter creating the traditional rom-com happy ending – his ensuing marriage worked well. But the ‘destiny’ assumption may
  not survive the cold light of real-life daily commitment, because it comes with certain built-in structural defects. The problem is, if fate has generously provided us with a predestined partner,
  there may seem no need for effort to make the relationship work – and if effort is needed then that particular romance is clearly not as predestined as we thought it was and probably needs to
  end forthwith. Professor Knee’s work suggests that those who believe in destiny love are likely to react badly when things go wrong, likely to exit relationships lightly, likely to move on
  quickly – to their next destiny.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast couples convinced of what Knee calls ‘growth love’, who see partnerships as developing slowly over time, with any glitches along the way meaning nothing
  sinister, but simply indicating a need for more effort. Growth love couples tend to get involved more gradually, have lower expectations, but are more capable of the long haul. It is certainly
  worth remembering that while belief in fate-determined love – whether on our side or on a partner’s – might add a breathless magic to romance, belief in growth-based love might
  mean the difference between a ruby wedding anniversary and being left at the altar.</p>
<p>Arranged</p>
<p>Letting destiny decide partner choice may seem like giving away control, but at least destiny (or fate or God or Providence) is all-seeing, all-knowing and infallible. Letting
  other, all-too-human beings decide partner choice seems a far worse bet, for ordinary folk are all too capable of confusion, ignorance, error and their own personal prejudices. Which is why, while
  accepting support on partner choice from friends and family may be helpful, it’s usually better to block one’s ears and step away. ‘You should’ and ‘you must’,
  even when voiced by onlookers with the best of intentions, should not govern partner decisions.</p>
<p>What does have a place, and a long history of some success – it’s even mentioned in the Bible – is allowing others to ‘arrange’ possibilities which we can veto, or
  from which we make our own pick. Don’t forget that until very recently, especially if a partnership was the way to cement political alliance or unite feuding families, it made perfect sense
  for elders rather than the happy couple to make the courtship decisions. In Britain, for example, it is only the last two generations of the monarchy that have had any kind of genuine personal
  freedom over marriage choice. (When certain of those love marriages failed, there was in some quarters a general feeling of ‘Well, what did they expect?’)</p>
<p>If done well, ‘arranged’ can triumph, delivering the objectivity of chance, the reassurance of destiny, the pragmatism of growth. Like chance, an externally determined partnership
  can avoid personal bias or the temptation to let lust dictate terms. Like destiny, it can remove the burden of choice, allowing us to relax rather than agonize about our own responsibility. Like
  growth-love, ‘arranged’ can mean we don’t demand instant compatibility, or call foul if things don’t prove perfect always and for ever.</p>
<p>But there does need to be a high level of competence here. Matchmakers – whether they be friends, family, the Jewish Shadchanim or the upmarket urban introduction service –
  need to know us at least as well as we know ourselves, need to know our partners well enough to judge the fit, and need to have a deep understanding of how relationships play out. The problem is
  that this level of wisdom is unusual in today’s society. Few people witness others profoundly and consistently enough to judge what is needed in a mate. Few relationships are sufficiently
  exposed to public gaze to deliver a real understanding of partnership dynamics. Which is why, though popular, modern matchmaking services can be infamous for high prices but low results. That said,
  in the right context and if the arranger is insightful and practised, ‘arranged’ can work well.</p>
<p>Let us be grateful we don’t live in 1917. Herbert Rawlinson and Alice Lake in the one-hundred-year-old black-and-white film Come Through.</p>
<p>A quick note on the extreme of ‘arranged’, those serried ranks of mass marriages where hundreds of couples meet for the first time on their wedding day, their partner choice made
  entirely by religious leaders. For most of us, this is somewhere between incomprehensible and appalling; how on earth does it ever work? The answer is that spouses’ contentment with the
  arrangement is constructed on their deep belief that they have the blessing of the deity; that their culture, community, family and religion will support them; and that love grows over time rather
  than instantly strikes. Despite individual horror stories, that’s a pretty big resource to bring to the table.</p>
<p>Online choice</p>
<p>Does online dating take control out of our hands? At first glance, no; we seem to have a multitude of options. But look more closely and we see that what we get is pre-sorted.
  Most sites cherry-pick attractive users and profile them on the home page to catch incomers’ attention. Many sites also highlight profiles of particularly popular users and present them as a
  separate and therefore more noticeable subcategory. We’re getting a choice, but only after the site filters have done their secret work.</p>
<p>And then there are the algorithms. It was way back in 1959 that a group of Stanford University maths students working on a final class project programmed their IBM 650 computer to pair up
  forty-nine men and forty-nine women according to their answers to a questionnaire; the result was one marriage and a deserved A-grade for the dissertation. More than half a century on, and that
  early study has led to a billion-dollar industry; almost every online dating site has a visible ‘questionnaire’ and they all have hidden algorithms to guide us firmly towards matches of
  our age, location and gender of preference. Choice is, if not taken out of our hands, at least slightly compromised.</p>
<p>There’s also another problem: dating sites only do the top level of the job. Yes, most sites match those who, on tick-box criteria, are similar, which replicates the surface-level criteria
  that attracts us to a mate; some sites then aim for more, with personality questionnaires or hormone-based matching systems. But while these matching systems maintain that the criteria for
  compatibility are well-established and that it’s therefore possible to predict relationship success, in fact ‘neither of these assumptions is true’. (I quote here from a recent
  research review of studies of online love-search by Professor Eli Finkel of Northwestern University, Illinois.) By allowing sites to try to match us, we are not only limiting our own options, not
  only failing to take into account the deeper compatibility factor, but also entrusting our fate to completely unproven systems.</p>
<p>Trusting chance</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that abandoning choice altogether is either a good or a bad idea. But it is a possibility. What you may find useful is to think about what degree of
  abandonment you’ve used in the past without even realizing it. Have you ever started chatting to someone near you at the theatre, during a party, on a train – then spent a delightful
  half-hour even though that didn’t lead to romance? Probably. Have you ever met a partner by chance, circumstance or sheer happy coincidence? Again, probably. Have any of your intimate
  relationships been 100 per cent predetermined and predicted? Probably not. Start to gauge the extent to which you’re comfortable with serendipity and you may feel more inclined to accept it
  as another tool in your decision-making kit.</p>
<p>Coin-tossing, random chance and a belief in fate are all quite risky. But handing over some of the burden to others is certainly worth considering – so perhaps let online dating sites
  screen the undesirables or let matchmaking services do the legwork. Allowing ourselves to widen our initial love-search beyond our personal preference is also useful – so perhaps make a
  deliberate effort to contact (or start talking to, or agree a date with) someone who on the surface doesn’t seem like a possible. Gathering emotional support is vital to get us through the
  process – so perhaps actively enrol trusted friends and turn to them for guidance, consolation and celebration.</p>
<p>Above all, when it comes to choice, be prepared to occasionally take a risk, accept uncertainty, let go of control. As ex US president Jimmy Carter once said, ‘Go out on a limb.
  That’s where the fruit is.’</p>
<p>From time to time, they both wondered what the next forty years of marriage would bring.</p>
