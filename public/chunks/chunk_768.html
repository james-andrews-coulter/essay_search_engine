        <h2>TRUE AND FALSE SELVES</h2>
<p>The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott made a distinction between what he termed a “true” and a “false” self. In order to be healthy, a baby and developing child needs to be allowed to express and experience its true self: that is, it has to be honest about its actual wishes and desires, without fear of censorship or any pressure to compromise. If it is feeling furious, it should have a tantrum. If it’s sad, it should weep. If it’s envious, it should gnarl. It should be allowed the luxury to express its genuine emotions in all their raw intensity. Later on, of course, the child will have to be taught about manners and the feelings of others. Gradually, but only gradually, it will be shown the way to adopt—at points—a false self that knows how to smile, say thank you and not let on about its disagreements. But only if the true self has had its say for a good long while can development be healthy—and Winnicott knew that too many of us are wandering the world without having had the chance to be appropriately awkward and tricky with others before the demand to be polite set in. Going “mad” for a while may be our attempt to return to some of the feelings that we had to surrender too soon in the name of not angering or upsetting parental figures. Therapy can offer us a second chance to recover contact with the true self and rage and cry as much as we need to.</p>
