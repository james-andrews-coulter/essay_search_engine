        <h2>3. Embracing Age</h2>
<p>George E. Vaillant’s Aging Well (Little, Brown, 2003) is full of fascinating life histories showing how people have overcome or transformed their early experiences. Zalman Schachter-Shalomi’s From Age-ing to Sage-ing (Grand Central Publishing, 1998) is as New Age as its title suggests, but still uplifting: the story of the Zen master in my Conclusion comes from here.
