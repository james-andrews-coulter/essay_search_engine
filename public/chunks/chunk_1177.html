<p>Time to drop in again on Gina’s parents, Sara and Clive. Sara isn’t quite as sanguine about getting older as she was when we last saw her. She’s gained some weight, which she thinks is ageing, and has started to worry that wearing her skirts short makes her look like ‘mutton dressed as lamb’. But then she wonders if sheep are an entirely female species, since Clive and his mates happily wear the same T-shirts and chinos as their 20-something sons and never fret about their resemblance to meat. Sara is contemplating having a facelift – only because, she says, she thinks she looks permanently ‘tired’, and wants how she feels inside (‘I don’t feel old’) to match her outside (‘but I’m beginning to look it’).</p>
<p>His and hers</p>
<p>Is Sara suffering from what Susan Sontag, in a major essay published in 1972, called ‘the double standard about ageing’? Sontag argued that a woman’s birth date was her dirty secret. Getting older, she claimed, was ‘less profoundly wounding’ for a man than it was for a woman because, for women, beauty was always identified with youthfulness. Older women, therefore, wanted to continue to look like girls, since those who could ‘pass’ as younger were still admired. But the bodies of old women who couldn’t were regarded as obscene.</p>
<p>The result of all this, Sontag suggested, was that women became ‘sexually ineligible’ much earlier than men: if a man were widowed in his forties or fifties he almost invariably went on to remarry someone younger, but this was rarely possible for women. And women, she lamented, acquiesced in it all, ending up full of self-hatred.</p>
<p>Sontag was clearly addressing her own anxieties – those of a classically beautiful woman approaching 40 (her essay was published four months before her birthday). She was prey to almost pathological anxieties about ageing, many of them social in origin, but others personal to her. She also seemed not to notice her own ageism.</p>
<p>Yet she made important observations about the gendered nature of ageing. How true are they forty years later? And do they give us any help in the business of ageing? In answer to the first question, over the intervening four decades the experience of ageing for women and men has become worse, better and different – all at the same time.</p>
<p>Worse because, in an era that’s so obsessed with the body and so permeated with visual images, appearance has assumed unprecedented importance. We’re now expected to scrutinize, discipline and beautify our bodies throughout the life course – you’re never too old to improve yourself, and never too young to start.</p>
<p>Although this often dresses itself up as a question of health, pull off its outer layers and underneath you find a preoccupation with youthfulness. What would an old, disabled but healthy and beautiful body look like? It’s a question we can’t answer today because those qualities seem mutually incompatible – that’s why the ‘but’ is there.</p>
<p>Of course stereotyping and prescriptive ideas about gender limit us at every age. A large survey of women conducted by a fashion company in 2011 came up with something it called ‘Midlife Mirror Angst’: women who were so uncomfortable with their reflection that they avoided it. Just 9 per cent of those over 50 felt happy with what they saw in the mirror, compared with 43 per cent of 20-somethings. It’s hard to decide which of those two percentages is the more depressing. Whichever, it suggests that the majority of women are unhappy about the way they look.</p>
