            <h1>7. The Genogram Exercise</h1>
<p>This exercise can take anything from a couple of hours to a week, depending on how much time you give it. It is best not to rush it, so attempt it when you have the time to do it justice. The genogram is probably one of the most comprehensive tools to aid self-awareness that exists, giving you nearly as much insight into yourself as you might get from a good therapist. But it comes with a warning. Look after yourself while you do it. Listen to your instinct. If you feel overwhelmed by the information you are uncovering, take that feeling seriously and take a break or stop. You can always come back to it later, or when you have more support.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>In the centre of a massive piece of paper draw a horizontal line. At each end of it put a very short vertical line – to a small square for your father on one end and, on the other end, to a circle for your mother.</p>
<p>If you were brought up by a gay couple, that would be two circles for two women or two squares for two men. Put their names next to their symbol and their birth date. If either one of them has died put an X through the circle or square and put in their date of death. If there has been a divorce or a separation mark the date of that with a double dash through the horizontal (marriage) line.</p>
<p>ii.</p>
<p>Next, put yourself and your siblings on the map, squares for males, circles for females. Put a star in your own circle or square, because you are starring in this exercise. Put in any miscarriages as a little dot.</p>
<p>iii.</p>
<p>Now put in your grandparents. Put in your aunts and uncles, in the right birth order. I’m not saying this is an easy thing to do, but keep at it. It’s at this stage I usually start again, on an even bigger piece of paper. Now you’ll have a map of your closest relatives, parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles.28 Now add your relatives by marriage and any additional blood relatives – your children, your nephews, cousins, nieces; include them all. Pick five adjectives to describe each person – get other members of your family to help you, but avoid sentimental nostalgia and be realistic.</p>
<p>iv.</p>
<p>If an individual has had more than one marriage or live-in partnership, show this by extending the marriage lines. Put in any non-relatives who lived with your family, such as a lodger or anyone who was especially important to you or your family – maybe with a line of a different colour.</p>
<p>Here are all the symbols you need on the maps. As you can see, you use different lines between two people to show if a relationship was close or conflicted, violent, loving, and so on.</p>
<p>As you create the family genogram, what are you noticing? What are your feelings? Are you fascinated or do you want to push it away? Try not to interpret or give explanations for the feelings straight away, but stay with those feelings. By doing this exercise you will be recovering impressions, memories and associations. Invisible messages, such as who you feel able to confide in and who you do not, will be filtering down to you as you create the genogram. You can keep all of these overt and hidden messages in mind and decide which you need to maintain and which you want to become more aware of, so that you can understand the impact your family or origin are having on your life now.</p>
<p>Think about the important choices you have made about wanting, or not wanting, to be defined by what you experienced and noticed in your family. Make a list of these things. Have these choices changed since you first made them? Which ones still operate in your life? Looking at these past relationships, can you trace how they may be affecting your current relationships?</p>
<p>Here are some further questions which you may wish to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which family member or members are you most similar to? Which of their qualities do you closely identify with?</li>
<li>Think about the earliest messages you got from each family member. What do you think is important in life? Where have your rules for living come from? For example, how much do you feel you can reveal about yourself to other people? Where does your openness, or your reserve, come from?</li>
<li>How is love expressed in your family? How is caring shown? What happened if someone needed extra help in your family? Who did they go to, and how did they get support? When you need support how do you get it?</li>
<li>How were emotions expressed in your family? How were emotions contained in your family? How were emotions repressed in your family?</li>
<li>How were the children treated and brought up? How were they disciplined?</li>
<li>What is your fantasy of a happy family? How does this compare to the reality represented in the genogram?</li>
<li>What did your parents get right?</li>
<li>How have the various family members related to each other, and how has that affected your life?</li>
<li>Look for family crises. Is there a pattern? Have there been any complete breakdowns of contact between siblings, for instance? Bankruptcies? Other disasters? Can you identify patterns of blaming? What are the patterns for chaos in your family?</li>
<li>What are the patterns for divorce in your parents’ family? What are they in your family?</li>
<li>Look at the patterns of the relationships between all the people on your map. Who got on? Who was estranged? Is there always someone who seems to have to play the role of the scapegoat – the outcast? Is there a culture of favouritism, too?</li>
<li>Who has had mental-health problems in your family? Looking at the mental-health problems through the generations, does it seem to come from family traits or from outside events? What evidence is there of the effect of traumatic experiences being passed down generations?</li>
<li>Look at your own relationship between you and your mother. Look at her relationship with her own mother. Do the same for your father and his father. Look at their relationships with both their parents.</li>
<li>What is the pattern of the relationship to authority in your family? What were your grandparents’ individual relationships with authority like? Your parents? Yours? How have their relationships with authority impacted upon yours? Repeat this question with regard to the opposite sex, ethnic minorities, poor people, rich people, foreigners, etc.</li>
<li>How did the patterns you have noticed help to shape your character, your identity?</li>
<li>What are the beliefs about the ‘right way’ of doing things in your family? What is the right way to make small talk or embark on a romantic relationship, for instance? What are the shared values, spoken and unspoken?</li>
<li>Do you feel in debit or credit, as far as affection and attention go? Do you feel understood by or unknown to your family of origin?</li>
<li>How were the expectations you have of relationships formed?</li>
<li>Are there any jobs or occupations that each generation seems to take up? What feelings do you have about the passing on of hobbies or professions?</li>
<li>How do the people on the genogram talk about the other people on the genogram? Have you noticed that before? How has it influenced how you talk about other people?</li>
<li>What was it like to be with your siblings when your parents were not present? Who played what role? Were you dismissed or valued? Who held the limelight? Who disappeared into the shadows? How has being a member of all these different-size groups affected you today? Do you feel there is safety in numbers? Or do you feel cowed by large groups? Are you fine being with one other person while feeling threatened in a three? If it is hard for you to be in a group today, can you trace where this came from by looking at your family genogram?</li>
<li>What are the stories that the older generation frequently told the younger generation? Are you passing them on in your turn? Are there similar rhythms to the stories you tell each other? Do you tell no stories at all?</li>
<li>How did your parents use television? Has this been passed down? Think about how food has been eaten in your family. Sitting around a table as a group? In front of the television? Or are family meals never taken?</li>
<li>What has been your ancestors’ attitude towards religion? How has this affected you?</li>
<li>How open or how secretive has your family been? With each other? With people beyond the family? What is your own attitude towards secrets?</li>
<li>What is the emotional legacy you have inherited? Which ways of believing, behaving, thinking and feeling have you inherited from your ancestors?</li>
<li>What has been your conditioning as to the right and wrong ways of doing things?</li>
<li>Was thinking more highly regarded than feeling or doing in your family? Or was being able to emote or to act given more approval? What is the legacy of this for you?</li>
<li>What stands out as the most important (positive and negative) things you have learnt from being in your family?</li>
<li>What are the male and female attitudes to work in your family? To money? To sex?</li>
<li>What part does immigration or emigration play in your family? Or staying put? How does this affect you today?</li>
<li>How are you tackling this exercise? How do you imagine your ancestors’ attitude towards it would have been?
These questions are not exhaustive. If other questions and lines of enquiry have come up for you, pursue them. These are just examples of questions you can answer more fully with the help of your genogram. Draw and write on it. You may want to create several with different themes.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the genogram you may be able to remember stories and family legends that are not toxic, but that nurture and nourish. Every family is a mixed bag and it’s important not to throw away the good as we pick out the less helpful myths we have overtly and covertly been told.</p>
<p>I compare this exercise to clearing out a cupboard, one I may not have looked into for a long time. Each object may have an emotional charge, but I need the space for new things; so, rather than keep everything or chucking away the lot, I need to be with each object, decide how I feel about it and either keep it or let it go.</p>
<p>This is a small sample of the exercises you can do to develop and maintain self-awareness. Some people might do them with a therapist or in a therapy group, but you can also do them on your own or with friends. Doing these exercises, like the job of staying sane, is an endeavour that is never finished. I have done the genogram many times and always find something new. I practise the 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise and the Grounding Exercise as part of my daily routine. I go through phases of keeping a diary and I like to keep the expansion of my comfort zone in mind. I would not claim I feel completely sane at all times but I feel this practice helps me in my efforts to achieve this.</p>
