        <h3>¶ Good Nationalism</h3>
<p>To many people, Nationalism sounds suspicious – dangerously close to jingoism and racism. But the desire to feel proud of one’s community is a natural and noble impulse. We just need sophisticated ways of directing our urge for pride.</p>
<p>Collective pride is important because there is never enough to be proud of in a single life. Nationalism takes the pressure off us to be individually accomplished and admirable. It lightens the oppressive responsibility we might otherwise feel to ensure that our own lives could always be stellar and heroic; that’s why patriotism often appeals to those who have the narrowest opportunities.</p>
<p>In an ideal, utopian society, nationalism would be a powerful sentiment, but it would be focused on things that don’t normally figure in national anthems or patriotic speeches. In the future, the nationalist might love their country for things such as: the general elegance and harmony of cities; the way you don’t have to be rich to live in a gracious neighbourhood; the low divorce rate brought about not by sullen resignation but because of the collective investment in the stages leading up to marriage, and the sophisticated support provided by the state when things get tricky in families. People would be proud that, in their nation, they consume a lot of elderflower cordial rather than alcohol; have a public honours system that rewards displays of wisdom; that the richest person in the country is a psychoanalyst; and that they have a global reputation for being tactful.</p>
<p>What we worry about isn’t, in truth, pride in a country but vanity about things that aren’t truly admirable. The solution to nationalism isn’t to abolish it (which isn’t viable anyway), but to create in a society things in which wise people could rightly take pride.</p>
