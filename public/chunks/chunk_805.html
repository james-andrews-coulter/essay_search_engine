        <h3>6We don’t go to schools of love</h3>
<p>The time has come for a third kind of marriage: the Marriage of Psychology, where one doesn’t marry either just for practical reasons (land, money, etc.), or for intuitive reasons (‘strong feelings’), but where our aspirations are properly submitted to examination and soberly understood, over many months, in the light of the daunting complexities of our respective psyches.</p>
<p>Presently, we marry without any information. We almost never read books specifically on the subject, we never spend more than a short time with children, and we don’t rigorously interrogate other married couples or speak with any sincerity to divorced ones. We go into it without any insightful reasons as to why marriages fail – beyond what we presume to be the idiocy or lack of imagination of their protagonists.</p>
<p>In the long-gone age of the Marriage of Reason, we might have considered the following criteria when marrying:</p>
<p>– who are their parents?</p>
<p>– how much land do they have?</p>
<p>– how culturally similar are they?</p>
<p>In the Romantic age, we might have looked out for the following signs to determine rightness:</p>
<p>– an inability to stop thinking of the lover</p>
<p>– a sexual obsession</p>
<p>– a belief that they are an angel</p>
<p>– a longing for constant contact</p>
<p>For the age of the Marriage of Psychology, we need a new set of criteria. We should wonder:</p>
<p>– how are they mad?</p>
<p>– how can we raise children with them?</p>
<p>– how can we develop together?</p>
<p>– how can we remain friends?</p>
<p>– how can we accommodate our competing needs for extracurricular sex on the one hand and loyalty on the other?</p>
