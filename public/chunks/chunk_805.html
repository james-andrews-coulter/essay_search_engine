        <h2>V : Hope</h2>
<p>For most of our lives, the majority of us don’t require anything as specific and formal-sounding as “reasons” to keep living. We take hope for granted, rising out of bed with purpose and direction; we may be preoccupied by this or that challenge, but the business of existence as a whole is never in question.</p>
<p>Then there are other moods, more somber and confused in nature, in which what we are doing on the earth comes to seem like a far more doubtful and painful matter. An accumulation of reversals—some perhaps minor, others more severe—undermines our will to endure much longer; the automatic reflex of living escapes us. There seems no point in getting up, we have no will to eat, we fall into a reverie halfway through pouring a glass of water, there is nowhere we can think of traveling, there is no one we want to talk to. We are going through the motions, but our spirit is elsewhere.</p>
<p>In our sad state, we can’t any longer say why we should take the trouble to get dressed or shower, why we should go to work or utter a word—or in fact take another breath. None of it seems obvious in the slightest. We might look around us in the park—at parents with children, pensioners with their dogs, or planes crossing the skies—and wonder by what peculiar, deluded and mysterious forces the whole vainglorious show is kept in motion.</p>
<p>It isn’t as if, when we are feeling purposeful and optimistic, we necessarily have a conscious grasp of the reasons why we have a taste for life. We have our reasons but we don’t have any need to identify them. They are so much in our command and are so many in number, we don’t single them out. We think it’s life itself we love, so don’t pay homage to any singular set of ingredients: for example, our health or our friends, our good name or our prospects of promotion. But when despair strikes, we can’t any longer be so casual about what might have the capacity to buoy us up.</p>
<p>We must learn to think through in rigorous ways what we had been accustomed to locate by reflex. We have to go in careful search of reasons why we should be. We have to ask ourselves, in a way the blessed never have to, how we are going to get through the coming years—or why we should bother, given the pain involved.</p>
<p>What follows is a set of small essays to assist us in our search for hope. They seek to lay before us some representative reasons why, despite everything, we might continue with tomorrow. Some are deliberately dark: It isn’t always optimism that best cheers. Our spirits can be sunk by a punishing impression that everyone else is content and that we are alone in our misery—and accordingly, there can be relief in learning that sadness is in fact very widespread and that there are solid grounds for why life is often hellish.</p>
<p>But we also need thoughts that can restore perspective and situate our woes in a larger context of time and space. Finally, we can shift to some positive pleasures that, like the caress of morning light on the blind in the convalescent’s room, await the recovering soul.</p>
<p>If we are to make a sustained recovery, we need to work our way toward our own well-defined list of arguments for pushing back against the forces of depression. The making of a list of hopeful things begins here.</p>
<p>1 The End of the Macrauchenia</p>
<p>Given the scale of the perils that face humanity, it is hardly surprising if serenity and peace of mind are hard to come by. Reasons to panic are daily brought before our eyes by the ever-inquisitive and always alarming modern media: There are wildfires raging across South America and Australia, currency manipulation is rife, people smugglers are working with impunity in Eastern Europe, bureaucracy is stifling innovation across the prosperous world, the air in large cities is more polluted than ever, soon there will be no more snow leopards, orangutans, or leatherback sea turtles, and there’s a gigantic new kind of pink seaweed threatening the health of the southern oceans. It’s a wonder we ever sleep.</p>
<p>At moments of particular alarm, we might turn our thoughts to the Macrauchenia. For millions of years, these delightful camel-sized animals flourished across what we now call South America, being found in their largest numbers in the north of Argentina. They were placid herbivores, with an endearingly droopy nose, a soft fleecy coat, and warm, contemplative eyes. They lived in small family groups, browsing inoffensively on the leaves of the jacaranda tree and in the evening trooping down to the many shallow lakes of the region to bathe.</p>
<p>Though the Macrauchenia had a very good run, they sadly didn’t make it in the end. They flourished from the Late Miocene period, about 7 million years ago, but then their fortunes ran out. The species was decimated by newer, aggressive creatures that came down from North America during the Great American Interchange, after the establishment of the Central American land bridge. The last Macrauchenia are estimated to have died—probably in the jaws of some kind of prairie dog—about 10,000 years before the arrival of stooped early humans at the end of the Pleistocene period. It was Charles Darwin who, on a short stopover in Puerto San Julián in Patagonia in 1834, uncovered the first Macrauchenia skeleton and it was given this name by Richard Owen in 1838.</p>
<p>The Macrauchenia would have been charming to get to know and deeply helpful to the farmers of South America—as well as its tourist industry. But their loss was not unusual. Some 99.9 percent of all organisms that have ever existed have been wiped out across the five mass extinctions of history. Five times over the last 500 million years life has more or less had to begin again from scratch. It is hugely unlikely that any of the species we are currently so attached to, and worried about—the Bornean elephant, the Ganges dolphin—will make it in the long term.</p>
<p>Macrauchenia. This extinct prehistoric mammal lived 7 million to 20,000 years ago (the Late Miocene to the Late Pleistocene).</p>
<p>Our own fate necessarily hangs in the balance as well. It would take a resolute optimist to venture that we will not in time follow the example of most of our forebears, including the narrow-nosed rhinoceros, the flat-headed peccary, and the dwarf hippo. This might seem like an entirely tragic thought, but it has its relieving aspect as well. We are commonly overburdened by a momentous sense of responsibility for what is to come. We worry about peace conferences, the path of gas pipelines, the vagaries of unemployment insurance, and the levels of nitrogen in the soil. These are fine ways to mop up anxiety but, in the grander scheme, we might as well be weeping over the long-distant demise of a friendly South American odd-toed ungulate.</p>
<p>The news constantly provides us with a ringside seat at the most compelling and horrendous issues of our times, which feed both our outrage and our sense that there must be something we can do to try to prevent disaster. But in the process, we forget the radical limits on our powers to intervene effectively in pretty much any of the dilemmas that bedevil our species. It is our particular historical fate to know more than we have ever done about the troubles of our fellow humans and yet to remain almost wholly ineffective at finding solutions, not because we are uncreative or lethargic but because we have been granted, at best, a teaspoon with which to drain an ocean. Our planet is shaped by gigantic forces—financial, political, biological, extraterrestrial—against which our individual wills are doomed to be substantially powerless. We have about as much chance of altering the dynamics behind our catastrophes as we have of shifting the orbital patterns of the moons of Jupiter.</p>
<p>There may be a few steps we can take to dampen our crises, but they will tend to be close to home and to concern the welfare of only a handful of people. We should not be harsh or unjust toward ourselves. We didn’t personally make the world and we aren’t individually responsible for its fate.</p>
<p>As we contemplate the extinct Macrauchenia, we are seeing an image of our own small innocence and admitting a liberating truth: A great many things, fortunately, are not really for us to try to control or feel in charge of. A few of the more nervous, fretful Macrauchenia might once have worried about the survival of their race as evening fell and giant anteaters rustled in the bushes, but the truly wise and contented ones would have loved their families, planned the evening meal for the little ones, and refrained from fretting too much about what was to come over the next million years.</p>
<p>2 After the Catastrophe</p>
<p>It’s been a lovely day with Grandfather. Aunts Tricia and Julie came by with their children, Christopher and Jennie.</p>
<p>It’s all pleasantly normal and average, except that the grandfather is Richard Nixon and he used to have the nuclear codes in his office and he engineered the end of the Vietnam War—and in 1974 he would have been put on trial for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and sent to prison, if he hadn’t received a pardon from his successor as president of the United States, Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>We’ll never face the level of condemnation that he did; no disgrace of ours can ever match his. And yet, after years of soul searching—and with the sheer passage of time—Richard Nixon was able to pull together a worthwhile existence. It was eventually possible to take pleasure in digging the garden, in spending the afternoon with the family, and in catching up with old acquaintances.</p>
<p>For many people, of course, Nixon was simply an appalling man utterly undeserving of sympathy. But we might be tempted to think of him in a different light when we—in our own way—have badly messed up and earned the contempt of others. Nixon is then, for us, not just a famously bad person but a version of our own flawed selves. Nixon’s failings were played out on the largest scale; our own disasters are more modest and local, but we too have—very often—been the shamefully guilty party.</p>
<p>What Nixon is sending us, via an ordinary family snap, is a message about the possibilities of recovery. He wasn’t an adept apologist, he didn’t make a grand return, he never shook off the widespread conviction that he was a devious character. But he was able to adjust and still find genuine sources of goodness and contentment in existence. What makes his example all the more touching is that he did this without being in any way specially skilled at redemption. He was still a flawed, awkward man. He wasn’t coming to the task of recovery with better chances than we have. At a dark moment, the image is speaking to us of our own future: modest, ordinary, but genuinely OK—which at troubled times seems almost more than we can dare to hope for.</p>

<p>3 The Bones of the Chief</p>
<p>In life, he was a great chieftain. After the withdrawal of the Roman army from Britain, he and his clan carved out a kingdom for themselves in the area that today lies just west of London. He led his people on daring raids on villages across the river. They sang his praises as they caroused around the campfire at night. He was a tall man for the time, evidently a ferocious fighter. He was famous and feared in the surrounding lands.</p>
<p>When he died, they buried him with all possible honor on a small hill overlooking a bend in the River Thames: the strategic center of their territory. Even in death, he would be the one to guide and protect them. They laid him out in his grave with his great sword and his treasured glass beaker—a prestigious rarity—beside him. The women wailed for days; the men lit funeral bonfires.</p>
<p>And then time passed. His kingdom was conquered and his Anglo-Saxon people became serfs to the new invading masters, the Normans. Quiet tenant farmers grazed their sheep on the lands he had won in battle. A railway line was constructed nearby, suburban villas sprang up, and, on tranquil evenings, retired solicitors and affable bank clerks and their wives would walk their dogs on the springy turf above his grave. The Winter Hill golf club laid out its fairways and sand bunkers where he had once mustered his loyal troops. A branch of a major supermarket chain opened within sight of his resting place and, on windy days, families would come over to fly kites, not realizing that they were standing just a few feet above the fragments of his skull.</p>
<p>All carried on as normal until, in 2018, a couple of local amateur archaeologists, armed with a metal detector, decided to explore the field. Alerted by the beeping of their machine, they began to very carefully remove the topsoil. His fine sword was half eaten away by rust and its beautiful leather scabbard had all but disintegrated; worms and beetles had consumed his flesh. Most of his bones had disintegrated and the roots of a gorse bush had grown through his ribcage.</p>

<p>There’s a shocking, poignant contrast between what he once was and what became of him. His status, his possessions, and his strength were entirely forgotten. The pagan gods he worshiped were replaced first by Christianity and then by an indifferent atheism. But, of course, this is not a fate peculiar to him. With time it will happen to every one of us. All the great people of today will eventually be forgotten. Their graves will be lost, the entire culture which gave them their prominence and rich rewards will disappear, and archaeologists will one day strive to decipher the identities of people we now find it unimaginable not to know.</p>
<p>It’s an oddly comforting thought. The distinctions and achievements which seem to matter so much in life will eventually lose their meaning and an ultimate equality of neglect will unite everyone. It won’t matter who was the chief and who the pauper. Even better, we don’t have to wait centuries for this sense of equality to take hold: We can summon the inevitable future into our imaginations right now. The youthful billionaire, the celebrity athlete, the handsome entrepreneur, the glamorous socialite—all will be returned to unity with us. As we look at their faces in a magazine or watch them on our screens, it is as if we can already see the future in which they will, like us, be crumpled anonymous bones in a forgotten patch of our gloriously indifferent earth.</p>

<p>4 Mick Jagger and the Jesuit Priest</p>
<p>One of the great moments of television history occurred in July 1967. Mick Jagger—then at the height of his fame and cultural influence—was helicoptered into the gardens of a large country house in the southeast of England to discuss his views on modern life with a group of distinguished establishment figures. The producers had picked these for one provocative reason above any others: they knew nothing about Jagger or his music.</p>
<p>One of the desperately out-of-touch interlocutors was a Jesuit priest and former master of an Oxford College, Fr Thomas Corbishley, SJ—seen in the center of the picture in his round clerical collar. He immediately admitted that not only did he know nothing about the Rolling Stones, he’d never heard a single song by any modern band. But he was extremely interested in Mick Jagger nevertheless and, in a patient and kindly way, probed the star to reveal more about his positive beliefs rather than saying what he was against.</p>
<p>To the many millions of people who watched the show, Corbishley must have seemed comically out of touch, a ridiculous antiquarian relic cut off from the atmosphere of freedom, authenticity, and liberation of modernity. But in his own way, the priest was the truly heroic and independent figure with much to teach his own times and our own. He had opted—against massive societal pressure—not to follow the herd and to pursue issues that were dear to him instead. Whatever the widespread enthusiasm for “Sympathy for the Devil” and “Honky Tonk Women,” Corbishley’s interests lay elsewhere: he had translated the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius Loyola, written commentaries on St Augustine, published a biography of the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and, in a number of books, explored what it meant to be a Catholic in the wake of the Second Vatican Council.</p>
<p>Mick Jagger, during the filming of World in Action, July 31, 1967.</p>
<p>The priest was pursuing what one might term a strategy of voluntary exile from the current preoccupations of his society. He didn’t feel any need to keep up with the flotsam and jetsam of contemporary culture. He felt closer to what was happening in Paris in 1254, when Thomas Aquinas wrote De Ente et Essentia (On Being and Essence) in defense of the Dominican community, than what was unfolding in Mary Quant’s store on the King’s Road in London in October 1965, where the first batch of miniskirts had just been launched. Corbishley was content to be thought ridiculous because he had his own well-defined concept of seriousness to hand.</p>
<p>We may not quite realize the extent to which we have mortgaged our inner lives to received ideas that are grievously alien to our true selves. We start to be free when we can dare to become—in selected areas wilfully ignorant, when we no longer have to know the names of certain musicians that everyone esteems, when we don’t feel compelled to read particular books that have won prizes, when we are left cold by vacation destinations, clothes, foods, exercise regimes, political scandals, and ideas that are dominant, when we can stay home rather than attend parties with people we dislike—and when we can hear of a celebrity and genuinely wonder who they might be. It is hard enough to have to exist in any given era; we don’t in addition have to mold our souls in its image.</p>
<p>5 The Aztecs and Tezcatlipoca</p>
<p>At the height of the Aztec Empire in the late 1400s, a major, daily preoccupation for a great many people involved worshiping and placating the god Tezcatlipoca. He was a one-legged divinity of smoke, darkness, hurricanes, and destruction—and a great many darkly beautiful representations of his head were made by affixing precious stones to the skulls of people who had been sacrificed in his honor.</p>
<p>It was believed that when an earlier version of human society had failed to worship him appropriately, the god had flown into a rage and unleashed a titanic storm that had annihilated everyone on earth. To avoid such a catastrophe ever recurring, every year a young man—selected for his supposed likeness to Tezcatlipoca—would be sacrificed to the god and his remains eaten by priests and royalty. The testy deity would then be induced to send benign rains to end the dry season and implored to resist his more apocalyptic instincts.</p>
<p>These were deeply and sincerely held beliefs, propounded by the most learned people of the day. To doubt or disregard them would have been reckless. Of course, dangerous questions must, in secret, sometimes have crossed people’s minds: How do we know Tezcatlipoca really exists? How do we know that he wants us to do these things? But to utter such heresies aloud would have been to invite imprisonment and death.</p>
<p>Today Tezcatlipoca has no power to frighten anyone: he’s a carefully labeled exhibit in a museum and a point of reference in obscure academic treatises on the history of weather deities. Our own attempts to predict rainfall involve sober investigations of surface ocean temperatures and the intensity of the currents of El Niño.</p>
<p>The beliefs about Tezcatlipoca have no possible basis in reality, but the Aztecs were not unusually credulous in holding them. On the contrary they were, measured against the broad span of history, entirely normal for doing so. All societies have collectively clung to highly peculiar ideas that in time have been revealed to be deeply mistaken and—often—close to insane. It would be impossible if the same were not true of our own times. The focus of mass delusion may change, but the phenomenon of delusion never abates. Central elements in what is now popularly taken to be the truth are almost certain to be mistaken—because crowds, almost by definition, are not out to discover the actual dimensions of reality. They don’t get agitated by subtle lapses in reasoning; they don’t urgently demand higher standards of evidence; they don’t march through the streets insisting on more thorough research. They merely want to find a sense of reassuring togetherness while demonizing and shaming those who disagree with them.</p>

<p>Far from clearing the air, modern democracy plays straight into this tendency in our nature, equating the majority view with justice and righteousness. Markets, too, emphasize the primacy of popular sentiment by rewarding companies that have no inclination to disabuse their customers of their errors of taste. It’s our strange fate to be born into an age of crowds in which the best, most precise thoughts are unlikely ever to meet with popular recognition.</p>
<p>Such an aristocratic attitude can sound absurdly outdated, but it offers us something that remains vital—and has nothing to do with genealogy or connections to the landed gentry. It’s the idea of being convinced from the outset that a popular outlook will frequently be riddled with errors and at odds with the beliefs of a thoughtful few, and that sanity must involve a willingness not to be ashamed, embarrassed, or even much saddened at being repeatedly out of sync with the dominant culture.</p>
<p>By understanding, without rancor, why most people subscribe to the myths of any age, we are released from waging a hopeless and dispiriting struggle against public opinion. We don’t expect our reasoned mentality to spread or to be easily absorbed. We know that most people will—as a matter of course—worship whatever version of Tezcatlipoca happens to be in vogue. We don’t have to blame them; we can just—quietly—keep to ourselves and hope never to end up on the wrong side of a sacrificial frenzy.</p>
<p>6 I Will Survive</p>
<p>In October 1978, one of the greatest pop songs of the twentieth century was heard for the first time: Gloria Gaynor’s eternal assertion of defiance: “I Will Survive.” It was initially released as a B-side but it quickly became one of the bestselling singles of all time thanks to its power to touch something universal in the human soul.</p>
<p>Gloria Gaynor hadn’t written the song herself. The words had in fact been penned by Dino Fekaris, a rather successful but temporarily disgruntled professional songwriter who’d just been sacked by Motown Records.</p>
<p>The song is in part a recollection of being trampled upon, of being taken for granted, but it’s not really about the wrong others have done to us; it’s an honest appraisal of the way we have let them do these things to us, because we have been insufficiently on our own side.</p>
<p>The other has undoubtedly harmed us, but the deeper problem is that we have not known how to esteem ourselves highly enough to stop them doing so. If they thought that we would crumble and lie down and die they did so for a good reason: because that is what we did so many times before. The beauty of the song is that it doesn’t deny that we have been accomplices to the bad treatment that we have traditionally been accorded. We identify with its heroine because she is frank enough to admit that she has been the architect of her own humiliation.</p>
<p>Gloria identifies with the overcompliant, fearful part of ourselves. But it’s because she understands our submissive tendencies so well that her deep encouragement to say a resolute “fuck off” to the world is so rousing. This is not the voice of someone who has never been put upon, it is that of a weak and timid being who is no longer going to let her fears rule her life.</p>
<p>Gloria Gaynor, 1979.</p>
<p>Defiance doesn’t mean asserting that I know I will survive. At the moment when we belt out the song on the dance floor or—more likely—in the kitchen, we don’t really know what will happen to us: our fears are still raw. We may have been bullied throughout our childhood or our relationships, we may only recently have instructed a lawyer to initiate divorce proceedings or written an email to a colleague. When we join in joyfully with the chorus, we’re making a great and precious leap of faith. We’re finally insisting that our ability to cope is greater than our past has traditionally led us to imagine.</p>
<p>Gloria is backing us up to attain what we might term emotional escape velocity. She’s instilling—with the encouragement of deceptively simple yet mesmerizing chords—the state of mind in which we can bear to take on those who have injured us.</p>
<p>An attitude of defiance is never the whole of what we need. For things to go well, we also have to call on reserves of conciliation, compromise, acceptance, and tolerance—the mature virtues by which genuinely good things are kept afloat in an imperfect world. But that’s not where we are right now. At this point, we still need to gird ourselves for a fight. And this is when the voice of Gloria Gaynor is not just a magnificent instance in the grand history of pop but for us—in a way that might feel embarrassing to admit to anyone else—what our soul needs to hear to save us from the weak but agonizingly familiar side of our nature that has so often given up so soon, too soon, on our hopes of freedom.</p>
<p>7 Budai</p>
<p>Buddhism gives every sign of being an unremittingly pessimistic philosophy: It loses few opportunities to remind us that life is suffering, that disappointment is the rule, and that we are fated to witness all our hopes and aspirations destroyed with time.</p>
<p>It can therefore feel a little paradoxical to come across the cult of Budai, a Chinese monk who became a saintly figure within Buddhism in the tenth century and is frequently represented in statues and on wall hangings, celebrated for his laughter, quick wit, and large belly, which he loved to rub while throwing back his head and chuckling warmly. What is a portly comedian doing in this religion of lamentation and sorrow? Why should we want to laugh, given what Buddhism has to tell us about our earthly prospects?</p>
<p>The paradox is only superficial. In essence, Buddhism wants to shake us from our pretensions, our complacency, and our misplaced perfectionism—and if these are its goals, then it sees no logical reason why they might not be accomplished as much via a set of witticisms as via a funereal lament.</p>
<p>Buddhism cannily understood that most humor arises from the omnipresent gap between our hopes and the available reality. We laugh not because things are happy but precisely because we have been helped to recognize that they are so damnably and incorrigibly sad. Our laughter represents a release of tension at the awfulness of everything.</p>
<p>We might laugh darkly at a joke that tells us that going on vacation will offer us a chance to be unhappy somewhere else with better weather. Or that celebrates marriage as an institution that generously offers us one very specific person to blame for all of our hitherto free-floating misery. Or that describes adolescence as a phase kindly designed by nature to ensure that we won’t end up overly sad that our children are soon going to be leaving home. Laughter is an involuntary spasm provoked by a pithy and skilful assessment of the fundamental misery of existence.</p>
<p>Importantly, we tend to laugh in company. Humor is a social activity. Dark truths that we had contemplated alone, with embarrassment and a sense of having been persecuted by fate, are given a chance to be shared among friends. That we are all laughing together is proof that we are not—whatever our suspicions—actually alone. We are fellow suffering humans facing up to similar sources of frustration and grief. We have not been accorded an especially unpleasant destiny. It turns out that everyone is crying—and therefore laughing—about careers, marriages, ageing, money, and children.</p>
<p>The secular West has traditionally relegated comedy to the realm of “entertainment”; it is “just” for laughs. Buddhism has been more ambitious. It understood that trying to elicit laughter can be the most effective means of prompting people to confront their pain and isolation. It isn’t a diversion from so-called serious things but rather the most graceful and kindly way of helping us to acknowledge and make our peace with them.</p>

<p>8 Cultivate Your Own Garden</p>
<p>It is crucial to note the subtitle of Candide, eighteenth-century Europe’s most famous novel, which was written in three inspired days in 1759: or Optimism. If there was one central target that its author wanted satirically to destroy, it was the hope of his age, a hope that focused on science, love, technical progress, and reason. Voltaire was enraged. Of course science wasn’t going to improve the world; it would merely give new power to tyrants. Of course philosophy would not be able to explain away the problem of evil; it would only show up our vanity. Of course love was an illusion, power a chimera, humans irredeemably wicked, and the future absurd. Of all this his readers were to be left in no doubt. Hope was a disease and it was Voltaire’s generous goal to try to cure us of it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his novel is not simply a tragic tale; nor is his own philosophy mordantly nihilistic. The book ends on a memorably tender and stoic note. The tone is elegiac and we encounter one of the finest expressions of the melancholic viewpoint ever written. Candide and his companions have traveled the world and suffered immensely: they have known persecution, shipwrecks, rapes, earthquakes, smallpox, starvation, and torture. But they have, more or less, survived and, in the final pages, find themselves in Turkey—a country Voltaire especially admired—living on a small farm in a suburb of Istanbul. One day they learn of trouble at the Ottoman court: Two viziers and the mufti have been strangled and several of their associates impaled. The news causes upset and fear in many. But near their farm, Candide, together with his friends Martin and Pangloss, pass an old man who is peacefully and indifferently sitting under an orange bower next to his house:</p>
<p>Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what the name of the strangled Mufti was. ‘I don’t know,’ answered the worthy man, ‘and I have never known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I have no idea what you’re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.’ Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee . . . – after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers’ beards. ‘You must have a vast and magnificent estate,’ said Candide to the Turk. ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings . . . I also know,’ said Candide, ‘that we must cultivate our garden.’</p>
<p>Voltaire, who liked to stir the prejudices of his largely Christian readers, especially enjoyed giving the idea for the most important line in his book—and arguably the most important adage in modern thought—to a Muslim, the true philosopher of the book known only as “the Turk”: “Il faut cultiver notre jardin” (“We must cultivate our garden”) or, as it has variously been translated, “We must grow our vegetables,” “We must tend to our lands” or “We need to work our fields.”</p>
<p>What did Voltaire mean with his gardening advice? That we must keep a good distance between ourselves and the world, because taking too close an interest in politics or public opinion is a fast route to aggravation and danger. We should know well enough at this point that humans are troublesome and will never achieve—at a state level—anything like the degree of logic and goodness we would wish for. We should never tie our personal moods to the condition of a whole nation or people in general, or we would have to weep continuously. We need to live in our own small plots, not the heads of strangers. At the same time, because our minds are prey to anxiety and despair, we need to keep ourselves busy. We need a project. It shouldn’t be too large or dependent on many. The project should send us to sleep every night weary but satisfied. It could be bringing up a child, writing a book, looking after a house, running a small store, or managing a little business. Or, of course, tending to a few acres. Note Voltaire’s geographical modesty. We should give up on trying to cultivate the whole of humanity; we should ignore things at a national or international scale. Take just a few acres and make those your focus. Establish a small orchard and grow lemons and apricots. Dig some beds and grow asparagus and carrots. Stop worrying yourself with humanity if you ever want peace of mind again. Who cares what’s happening in Constantinople or what’s up with the grand mufti? Live quietly like the old Turk, enjoying the sunshine in the orange bower next to your house. This is Voltaire’s stirring, ever-relevant form of horticultural quietism. We have been warned and guided.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Voltaire put his lines about the cultivation of the garden into the mouth of a Muslim. He had done a lot of reading about Islam for his Essay on Universal History, published three years before, and properly understood the role of gardens in its theology. For Muslims, because the world at large can never be rendered perfect, it is the task of the pious to try to give a foretaste of what is to come in the afterlife, which can be seen as a well-tended garden—and where that is not possible, in the depiction of a garden in a rug. There should be four canals that allude to the four rivers of paradise, in which were said to flow water, milk, wine, and honey, and where they intersect represents the umbilicus mundi, the navel of the world, where the gift of life emerged. Gardening is no trivial pastime. It’s a central way of shielding ourselves from the influence of the chaotic, dangerous world beyond while focusing our energies on something that can reflect the goodness and grace we long for.</p>
<p>Emperor Babur overseeing his gardeners, c. 1590.</p>
<p>We melancholics know that humans—ourselves foremost among them—are beyond redemption. We melancholics have given up on dreams of complete purity and unblemished happiness. We know that this world is, for the most part, hellish and heartbreakingly vicious. We know that our minds are full of demons that will not leave us alone for long. Nevertheless, we are committed to not slipping into despondency. We remain deeply interested in kindness, in friendship, in art, in family life—and in spending some very quiet local afternoons gardening.</p>
<p>The melancholic position is ultimately the only sensible one for a broken human. It’s where we get to, after we have been hopeful, after we have tried love, after we have been tempted by fame, after we have despaired, after we have gone mad, after we have considered ending it—and after we have decided conclusively to keep going. It captures the best possible attitude to pain and the wisest orientation of a weary mind toward what remains hopeful and good.</p>

<p>9 The Hotaru</p>
<p>One of nature’s odder creatures is the firefly, a soft-bodied beetle that emits a warm yellow glow from its lower abdomen, typically at twilight, in order to attract mates or prey. Though relatively rare in Europe and North America, the firefly is a common sight in Japan, where it is known as the hotaru. Hotaru are at their most plentiful in June and July and can be seen buzzing in large groups around rivers and lakes. The glittering light is so enchanting, the Japanese have traditionally held firefly festivals—or hotaru matsuri—in order to watch these creatures caper and to recite poetry in their honor.</p>
<p>Something more magical has happened to the firefly in Japanese culture: it has become philosophical. Zen Buddhist poets and philosophers—the two terms are largely interchangeable—have urged us to look at fireflies as sources of a distinctive wisdom and serenity. What we are truly being invited to see in the firefly is not an insect but a version of ourselves. We too are tiny against the darkness, we too have no option but to put on a desperate light show in the hope of enticing possible partners, and we too won’t last very long: Fireflies all die within three weeks.</p>
<p>Importantly, the metaphor is a generous one. We aren’t being likened to rats or flies, with whom we have a few less flattering similarities as well. Fireflies are graceful and mesmerizing. They appear bold and touching, protesting bravely against the blackness in the limited hours afforded to them.</p>
<p>Kobayashi Kiyochika, Fireflies at Ochanomizu, c. 1880.</p>
<p>Many of our mental troubles spring from an overambitious sense of who we are. We ascribe to ourselves an importance that the natural world and our fellow humans turn out not to recognize. We protest in a bad temper at our puniness and lack of agency.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the firefly bids us to loosen our hold on arrogance and irritation. We should not complain at our slightness but submit to it with wonder and poise. It isn’t a personal curse that we aren’t going to live very long and that our actions are but a short merry dance. We should know and accept our nature: A firefly does not mistake itself for a lion or a tortoise. We can imagine our cities from outer space looking much like the frantic swirls of fireflies across a lake: touching, absurd, beautiful, and minuscule within the order of the cosmos.</p>
<p>The art of locating important philosophical themes in the natural world is one that Zen makes repeatedly: for example, in relation to bamboo, which is evocative of resilience; water, which is a symbol of patient strength, capable of wearing down stone; and cherry blossom, which is an emblem of the brevity of happiness. Zen seeks to hang its ideology on to everyday things because it wants to make use of what is most ordinarily in our sight to keep us tethered to nourishing truths.</p>
<p>It also imbues its lessons with poetry. In a legendary haiku, the great seventeenth-century poet Matsuo Bashō attempts to quieten our egoistic ambition by focusing on a firefly, through which we may grow more attentive to our own finitude:</p>
<p>Falling from</p>
<p>A blade of grass, to fly off –</p>
<p>A firefly.</p>
<p>On its slender wings, the firefly is an ideal carrier of Zen reminders of the need for dignified resignation in the face of the mightiness and destructiveness of the natural order. Kobayashi Issa, an eighteenth-century Buddhist priest as well as a haiku master, wrote 230 poems on fireflies. In one of the most celebrated, he captures a moment in high summer when time is momentarily stilled as the insects put on their show:</p>
<p>The fireflies are sparkling</p>
<p>And even the mouth of a frog</p>
<p>Hangs wide open</p>
<p>It is a tiny moment of satori or enlightenment. The frog is as wonderstruck as the poet at the movements of the brave, doomed fireflies—much as we should fairly be amazed, grateful, and ultimately joyous to have been allocated a few brief moments in which to dance and give off a burst of light against the darkness of an always largely impenetrable universe that is already 13.8 billion years old.</p>
<p>10 The Emperor’s Giraffe</p>
<p>We may be sad because we think we know it all, because everything has grown stale and familiar—because we have, for very understandable reasons, lost the ability to wonder.</p>
<p>Yet the world is always stranger and more unexpected than we can bring ourselves to believe in our depressed moods. Zhu Di, the Yongle Emperor, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty (r. 1402–24), had by middle age grown tired of his role as royal intermediary between heaven and earth. He had a thousand mistresses, he’d conquered Vietnam and tamed the Mongols, and he’d commissioned the largest book ever written, the Yongle Encyclopedia, which explained every element in the history of Chinese civilization. But, weary in his soul, the Emperor made a move that none of his predecessors had ever attempted. He sent some ships to explore the wider world. Chinese rulers knew their country to be the most interesting and blessed on the planet and therefore generally felt no need to go elsewhere—beyond at most subduing a near neighbor. Yet Zhu Di asked his explorer and mariner, the eunuch Admiral Zheng He, to venture out and make a thorough survey of all the barbarian lands he could find. With a more or less unlimited budget, Zheng He had a vast fleet built in the Longjiang shipyard near Nanjing and, after a banquet presided over by the Emperor at which sacrifices were made to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors, China’s largest-ever expeditionary force set off. It dropped in on Brunei, Java, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India before crossing to Arabia and Africa, stopping at Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi.</p>
<p>Along the way, the admiral picked up a panoply of gifts and treasures that he hoped would amuse and delight the Emperor: manuscripts, sculptures, clothes, gold, palm and date trees, figs, all manner of spices, a few slaves, and many new concubines. But what Zhu Di really loved was animals and the admiral picked up a veritable zoo-full that had never been seen before in China: lions, leopards, dromedary camels, ostriches, zebras, a rhino, and antelopes.</p>
<p>One animal in particular took the Emperor’s fancy: a giraffe that his admiral had bought from a couple of intrepid Kenyan traders in eastern India. Laying eyes on it for the first time, he stroked the animal’s hide, marveled at its long neck and graceful but slightly awkward way of walking—and gave it his blessing. His spirits having lifted, Zhu Di invited the entire court to take a look. He had an enclosure especially built for the giraffe in his palace and often took walks with it around the grounds. Unsurprisingly, he asked his favorite artist to capture his new friend, an honor he did not bestow on any other foreign animal.</p>
<p>We probably all had some of Emperor Zhu Di’s excitement when we first laid eyes on a giraffe, at the age of three. We too would have marveled at that long neck and admired the bright patterning and strange gait. But somewhere along the line, we stopped wondering—about giraffes and pretty much everything else as well. The world became familiar and then stale.</p>
<p>We should not, perhaps, have given up so easily. Giraffes remain hugely odd and importantly wonderful. We do not live on a dull planet, but we have allowed our sorrows to drain our capacity for joy. We should, when depression weighs us down, strive to remind ourselves that the world remains full of giraffes and what they symbolize: renewed charm and creativity, new opportunities for interest, and fresh reasons to keep going.</p>

<p>11 An End to Suffering</p>
<p>Hinduism is both salutary and original in proposing that there is nothing especially noble or interesting about being alive. Once we look at matters dispassionately, a lot of what we have to go through is misery and suffering: we need—with great effort—to grow up, to assume responsibilities, to master a profession, to have a family, to take our place in societies full of backbiting and hypocrisy, to watch those we love get ill, and eventually to succumb to old age ourselves. To think highly of life is, through a Hindu lens, a fundamental intellectual error.</p>
<p>As Hinduism sees it, our real purpose is to be done with life for ever. That is the true summit of existence. Hinduism reverses the Western equation: The sinful and blinkered are forced to live for ever, while the righteous and awakened are privileged enough to be able to die. If we are not careful, if we do not show sufficient mercy and imagination toward others, we may well—Hinduism suggests—be subjected to the ultimate punishment: We will have to carry on into eternity.</p>
<p>The symbol of this ghastly ongoingness is the eight-spoked wheel of samsara, the most commonly depicted element in the religion, which evokes the pitiless and unceasing nature of life—to which we are committed unless we take a disciplined series of averting actions that together comprise the central components of Hindu ethics.</p>
<p>Hinduism does not suggest that we will carry on for ever in our own bodies. According to the process of samsara, we are reborn into a succession of different outward envelopes, each of which is eroded away and disintegrated by time. Because samsara is at work across the whole animal kingdom, we might find that our enduring atman or soul transmigrates at our death into the body of a woodlouse, a pelican, or a house spider, though we might also be reborn as a paediatric nurse or a president. What determines the quality of the migration is the degree of karma or virtue that we have accrued in our lives. Among the many reasons we might have to be kind to others is an awareness that unkindness might leave us having to suffer a cycle or two of life as a cockroach or a naked mole rat.</p>
<p>Along the way, Hinduism generates an uncommon degree of respect and tenderness for all living things. When we look at a wasp or a crab, we aren’t contemplating creatures fundamentally different from ourselves; a few turns of the wheel of life ago their atman might have been located in a High Court judge or a dental hygienist. We might as a result—as most Hindus do—feel it appropriate to stick to a vegetarian diet, lest we unwittingly eat our old uncle or geography teacher.</p>
<p>The suspicion that life is constantly painful and anxious is one that we largely have to bear in a very lonely way in the philosophies of the West. In those of the East, however, pessimism is ennobled and takes center stage. We are permitted to feel weary and amply dissatisfied. We have, without quite knowing it, been alive since the start of creation, and it is untenably exhausting and frustrating. The trick, and the true prize, will be to be good and wise enough to learn to die once and for all.</p>
<p>For Hindus, the way to step off the treadmill of eternal existence relies, first and foremost, on a piece of intellectual insight. We cease to be subject to samsara and are delivered into the comforting repose of nothingness known as brahman once we realize that, despite many appearances to the contrary, however paradoxical or absurd the idea might sound, we and the universe are in truth one.</p>
<p>An eight-spoked wheel decorating the Hindu Konark Sun Temple in India, 13th century.</p>
<p>From the earliest age, we tend to assume the very opposite. It seems self-evident that we are one kind of thing and the tree over there, the relative over here, the clouds in the sky, the monkey on the parapet, and the river wending its way to the sea belong to quite different categories. Yet Hinduism insists that our belief in difference belongs ultimately to a realm of maya or illusion. If we look more deeply into the nature of things, through the help of teaching and spiritual exercises, we stand to discover the remarkable unity of all elements. Contrary to appearances, everything we see and experience around us belongs to the same life force: the leaves unfurling on the tree, the child learning to read, the earthworm digging its tunnels, the lava bubbling from the earth – all belong to a single unitary power which only egoistic prejudice has hitherto prevented us from acknowledging as one.</p>
<p>Most of our pain, Hinduism argues, arises from an overeager attachment to the differences between ourselves and the rest of the world. We pay inordinate attention to who has slightly more money or respect than we do. We are constantly humiliated by people and events that don’t seem to honor our sense of uniqueness.</p>
<p>But through a process known as moksha or liberation, we can throw off the veil of illusion that works to separate us from the universe and start to identify with cosmic totality. It no longer matters exactly where we end and others begin; everything belongs to the same whole that we have mistakenly and unnecessarily carved up into parts. There is a little less reason to grasp, to be puffed up, to be proud, or to become embittered. We can survey the course of our lives and of our societies with calm indifference. We can cease to identify happiness with the working out of our will upon the world and instead take in with compassion and serenity whatever destiny throws our way. We will then enjoy paripurna-brahmanubhava, the experience of oneness with brahman, the principle of all things.</p>
<p>Once we have let go of our ego like this, we may have a few more years left to live, but we can be sure that—eventually—we will not need to keep returning. Constant rebirth is the fate of those who cleave too tightly to their own selves. By contrast, those who have learned to surrender can at their demise merge with the universe and will never need to suffer the indignities of individual life again.</p>
<p>12 The Deckchairs of the Titanic</p>
<p>There remain few expressions better able to capture the futility of a task than one which compares our efforts to “rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.” The hull has been breached and the ship is sinking, so to concern ourselves with the position of the loungers would be the ultimate folly, the deepest possible failure to recognize the true hopelessness of the situation.</p>
<p>The point seems grimly apt because we are, many of us, a little like the passengers on a stricken liner. Our larger hopes in life have been fatally holed: We see now that our careers won’t ever particularly flourish; our relationships will always be compromised; we’ve passed our peak in terms of looks; our bodies are going to fall prey to ever more humiliating illnesses; society isn’t going to cure itself; significant political progress looks deeply improbable. Our ship is going down. It can feel as if trying to improve our condition, let alone find pleasure and distraction, would be an insult to the facts. Our instinct is to be as funereal and gloomy as our ultimate end.</p>
<p>But there’s one crucial element that distinguishes our predicament from that of the passengers who lost their lives on the RMS Titanic in the early hours of April 15, 1912: time. They had little more than two hours between feeling the ominous shudder of the impact and the moment when the once-majestic vessel broke apart and sank into the North Atlantic. We’re going down too, but far, far more slowly. It’s as if the captain had let it be known that the hull had been breached, there were not enough lifeboats, and there was zero chance of ever reaching port, but then added that it would probably be many decades before we finally slipped beneath the waves.</p>
<p>So though we can’t be saved, though the end will be grim, we still have options as to how to use our remaining time. We are involved in a catastrophe, but there are better and worse ways of filling the days. In those circumstances, expending thought and effort on “rearranging the deckchairs” is no longer ridiculous at all; it’s an eminently logical step. There could be no higher calling.</p>
<p>Francis Browne, Titanic ’s port side A-Deck promenade, April 11, 1912.</p>
<p>When our large hopes for ourselves become unattainable, we have to become inventive around lesser, but still real, options for the time that remains. Keeping cheerful and engaged in spite of everything becomes a major task. If we were on a very gradually sinking luxury liner in the early twentieth century, we might every evening strive to put on a dinner jacket and go to dance the foxtrot to the music of the string quintet, sing a cheerful song, or settle into the second-class library on C Deck as, all the while, bits of seaweed and debris lapped at our ankles. Or we might look out for the best spot for our collapsible recliner so that we could watch the seabirds wheeling in the sky or seek some privacy for a long, soul-exploring conversation with a new friend to the sound of crockery smashing somewhere in a galley down below. We might try our first game of quoits on the slightly tilting deck or drop in contrary to our habits up to this time—on a wild party in steerage. Of course, from a wider perspective our lives would remain a thorough disaster, but we might find we were starting to enjoy ourselves.</p>
<p>Such inventiveness is precisely what we need to learn how to develop in order to cope with our doomed state. How can we invest the coming period with meaning even though everything is, overall, entirely dark? It’s a question our culture hasn’t prepared us for. We’ve been taught to focus on our big hopes, on how we can aim for everything going right. We crave a loving marriage, deeply satisfying and richly rewarding work, a stellar reputation, an ideally fit body, and positive social change. We’ve not been prepared—as yet—to ask ourselves what remains when many of these are no longer options: when love will always be tricky, politics compromised, or the crowd hostile. What are the viable ways of seeking the best spot for a deckchair on a listing liner?</p>
<p>If marriage is far less blissful than we’d imagined, perhaps we can turn to friendship. If society won’t accord us the dignity we deserve, perhaps we can find a group of fellow outcasts. If our careers have irretrievably faltered, perhaps we can turn to new interests. If political progress turns out to be perennially blocked and the news is always sour, we might absorb ourselves in nature.</p>
<p>We are turning to what our society might dismiss as Plan Bs: what people do when they can’t do the things they really want to do. But there’s a surprising catch—or, really, the opposite of a catch. It may turn out that the secondary, lesser, lighter reasons for living are in fact more substantial than we’d imagined. And once we get to know them, we might come to think that they are what we should have been focusing on all along. It has taken a seeming disaster to get us to realize how central they should always have been.</p>
<p>13 Calvary Cemetery</p>
<p>In the city behind the cemetery are some of the most driven, clever, productive, ruthless, and cynical people ever to have been gathered into a single space in the history of humankind. On the island of Manhattan, we don’t exist aside from the money and fame we accrue. There is no friendship or pity. Everyone is longing to see everyone else disgraced. People are proud of their cynicism. We need to triumph rapidly—or leave town.</p>
<p>It’s to defend ourselves against the fear and panic induced by this terrifying piece of real estate that we should take a subway out to Calvary Cemetery in Queens: 365 acres tightly packed with the bodies of military heroes, Wall Street Titans, Fifth Avenue princesses, and the ordinary heart attack and cancer victims of the northeastern United States. It might sound sad to spend a few hours communing with the dead in this way but it may, in these parts, be a great deal more reviving than attempting to connect with the living. Amid the graves, there is at least room for sympathy; there is space for thoughtfulness and tenderness. No one mentions an IPO.</p>
<p>Whatever their wealth, everyone slips into a similar-sized coffin. The most famous and awe-inspiring are reliably forgotten within two generations and each corpse however large its last tax return—is quickly gnawed at by similar armies of undiscriminating worms. Death is beautifully democratic: To microbial life, the Upper East Side tastes much the same as the Bronx. The former leave exclusive penthouses on Park Avenue feet first in the morning and by evening are interred for eternity in a plot no larger than one of their former bathtubs. Everyone is silent, there is no more gossip, the journalists have gone, and the invitations dried up.</p>
<p>The largest cities of modernity excel in their powers to shatter our sincerity and peace of mind. It becomes impossible not to worry that we have been excluded and not to have nightmares about our downfall. We know that we should leave time for introspection, creativity, and vulnerable conversation, but we are too scared to remember how to begin. We forget all that is gentle and touching and that we understood so well when we were five. We cannot turn away from a mass media which appals us with news of never-ending threats to our reputations and livelihoods or those of others. We fear we can never be loved outside of what we can boast about at dinner.</p>
<p>The cemetery cares nothing for all of this. It bids us to sit on a bench and commune for a while with its stable and heartfelt verities. It asks us to live in such a way that we do not dishonor ourselves from the perspective of death. We should worry only about those things that still seem serious when contemplated from the far side of the grave. We should measure our thoughts against the implied verdicts of a skeleton.</p>
<p>We can be grateful to the dead of Queens for trying to save us from the living of Manhattan.</p>

<p>14 Meteor Crater</p>
<p>Day to day, the evidence for the idea is so slight, and the entire concept so peculiar and contrary to our sense of things, it’s no wonder that we push it to the back of our minds and have resisted giving it its due place in public consciousness. And yet the evidence is incontrovertible: Much of who we are and of how life on the planet has taken hold is to be explained by the arrival of asteroids and comets.</p>
<p>In the Earth’s early days 4.5 billion years ago, things were entirely dry, lifeless, and inert until, around 3.8 billion years ago, the planet underwent what is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of up to 200 million years in which giant planets were knocked off their normal circuits and objects scattered into the path of the terrestrial planets. Some 100,000 asteroids and comets of all different sizes smashed into the atmosphere-less Earth and on board these extraterrestrial objects came the central ingredients for life: the water in the oceans, the calcium in our teeth, the potassium in our brains, the carbon in our hair, the glycine in our cells, and the ribose in our DNA.</p>
<p>The evidence has since then been well concealed. We can see the pockmarked surface of the moon or Mars well enough through our telescopes, but here on Earth the mantle of life has cleverly disguised the story of its origins. Most of the craters have been filled in by vegetation, water, or erosion. There remain only a hundred or so pristine impact sites to be seen anywhere on the planet.</p>
<p>For a long time, the locals in Winslow, Arizona, refused to accept that this is what the place could be. They took it to be a volcano; many just called it a mountain. But one local meteoriticist, Harvey Nininger, insisted on the extraterrestrial theory, toured the area picking up small fragments of the alleged meteorite, wrote a book called A Comet Strikes the Earth, and set up the American Meteorite Museum a few miles from the crater’s rim. Settled scientific opinion now agrees: The big hole in the ground exists because 50,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, a nickel-iron meteorite fifty meters wide slammed into Arizona at 12.8 kilometers a second and released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s one of the most photogenic of all craters and so we might choose to pin it to the refrigerator door and turn to it whenever we feel any temptation toward self-righteousness or grandiosity. If one was founding a new religion dedicated to wisdom and maturity, Winslow might have a good claim to be considered the new Jerusalem.</p>

<p>15 San Juan River</p>
<p>One of our greatest difficulties—it gives us problems in so many areas is that we can’t understand time. However often the facts are explained to us, they keep slipping from our minds. Our myopia is partly rooted in our lifespan: The eighty or so years we have on the planet tend to power a steadfast background sense of what a “long time” might mean. Our brains dwell predominantly on the here and now, for there seems no efficiency or reward in having too many thoughts about what used to be or what is to come. Three months from now already feels very remote; a decade before our birth has a primeval sheen to it; five years away is unimaginable.</p>
<p>These biases are understandable but they make things far harder than they need to be. We continually exaggerate both the importance of setbacks in our individual lives and, more broadly, the significance of these lives within the greater span of planetary existence. And as a result we panic far more than we should and we laugh far less than we might. Anyone who thinks of a five-hour journey as “long” or a three-minute download time as “slow” is going to have problems finding perspective around a great many travails.</p>
<p>The sharp bends in the San Juan river in southeastern Utah appear to know our problem well enough and offer us a powerful solution to it. We cannot spend more than a moment in their company without sensing that we are being told something very powerful about time and, more specifically, how much of it there has been—and how little of that has been about us, or government ministers, or shocking headlines, or mesmerizing scandals. The San Juan river has very slowly cut a winding 300-meter-deep canyon through 300 million years of time. The rocks at the bottom date back to the Palaeozoic period, some 60 million years before the dinosaurs. The Earth’s continents were at that point fused together into the giant landmass of Pangea, the apex predator was the Dimetrodon, the land was populated by synapsids and diapsids, and the seas were filled with mollusks, echinoderms, brachiopods, and ammonoids. The air buzzed with dragonflies the size of eagles.</p>
<p>San Juan river, Utah, 2010.</p>
<p>We forget most of what we’ve ever been taught about time, but it pays to keep a few basic facts in mind:</p>
<p>the Earth was formed 4.543 billion years ago</p>
<p>life on Earth started 3.77 billion years ago</p>
<p>the first land animal dates back 428 million years</p>
<p>the first dinosaurs date back 243 million years</p>
<p>the first Homo sapiens date back 200,000 years</p>
<p>agriculture started 10,000 years ago</p>
<p>the early dynastic period in Egypt began 3,000 years ago</p>
<p>the Roman Empire was at its height 1,920 years ago</p>
<p>the first photograph was taken 196 years ago</p>
<p>the first powered flight took place 120 years ago</p>
<p>my last moment of despair was 5 days ago</p>
<p>Even as we scan the list, our attention may blur: a few million here or there is a hard concept to fix in the mind. The San Juan river appreciates the difficulty and won’t set us any tests. It is content—through its majestic beauty—to make an overall point that should reach us through our senses as much as it does through our understanding. It really only wants to say one very simple thing to us non-experts in its ancient gravelly voice: that it is very, very old and that we are very, very short-lived. And on that basis alone, we should probably surrender our absurd and painful sense of the seriousness and importance of all that we are and do.</p>
<p>16 Arco di Riccardo</p>
<p>The Roman gateway now known as the Arco di Riccardo—the Riccardo in question may or may not be Richard the Lionheart—was erected in the city of Tergeste (modern Trieste) at some point during the first century ad.</p>
<p>It formed part of an extensive program of works for the city which included new walls, baths, and a library. The architect would have been well known and newcomers would have been awed. But as the centuries passed the Romans lost their empire. The statues that had once adorned the area were vandalized. The city was annexed by one warlord after another. The surroundings decayed and anyone who could do moved away. People chiseled out lumps of stone from the arch to repair their own homes. In winter ice expanded in the cracks, gradually weakening the entire fabric.</p>
<p>A tenement building was erected beside the arch, casually making use of one of its piers as part of the side wall and destroying its once-noble symmetry. Today, the arch juts straight out of a restaurant famed locally for its orecchiette with fresh tuna and its swordfish with aubergine purée.</p>
<p>For those who knew the arch when it was built, it might be confounding to see it battered, mutilated, and half buried. But we can take pride in its survival as well. The past may be substantially submerged but bits of it live on; things don’t disappear entirely. We can make our peace with what remains, integrating its irregular masonry into our present. We can live promiscuously among the debris of different ages. An old gateway might magnanimously offer to hold up a beam of a family restaurant where, after much thought, we may order the maccheroncini with red shrimp.</p>
<p>Arco di Riccardo, Trieste, Italy, 2017.</p>
<p>Surprising us in the middle of a street with its ancientness, the arch offers to release us from the intimidating aspects of our own times. Everything that seems impressive or important today will gradually lose its prestige. Our urgent debates will be known only to a few scholars who will struggle to find an audience. Our current celebrities will seem like the most old-fashioned people in the world and then will be forgotten entirely. Our most radical ideas will sound incomprehensible and everything that motivates or disturbs us will be forgotten. Our personal errors will count for nothing in the sweep of history. No one will remember or care about our failings. The things that loom so large and are so painful and agitating in our own picture of our lives will leave almost no trace.</p>
<p>To the Romans who built the arch, it would have seemed that the fall of their world was the fall of the entire world. They could not begin to imagine that the planet would ultimately survive well enough without them and that new and, in significant ways, much better forms of society would eventually emerge.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, someone will look on a decayed fragment of New York, Tokyo, or London and wonder for a moment about what we who lived then were like—and all their ideas will be wrong and we will be free.</p>
<p>17 The Fennec Fox</p>
<p>It’s hard to think of an animal better adapted to the strange and difficult place it has to live than the fennec fox. In its native Saharan and Sinai deserts, the fennec has to cope with daytime temperatures of 40°C (104°F), a near-complete lack of water, boiling sand, sparse food supplies, and predatory vultures and jackals. Yet for each of its many challenges, it has arrived at an ingenious solution: its vast ears, up to fifteen centimeters long, help dissipate heat and detect the slightest movement of lizards and geckos; it can allow its body temperature to rise to 40.9°C (105.6°F) before it begins to sweat; it pants at a record-breaking 690 breaths a minute; it has specially adapted kidneys that produce hyperosmotic urine; and its fur covers its feet to give them traction and stop them burning as it runs across the hot sand.</p>
<p>To look at a fennec is to see evidence of 8 million years of evolution in relation to the rigors of one very specific habitat. We humans don’t need to be jealous. We too were entirely well adapted to our original habitats: We acquired intensely fearful reactions that would alert us to predators, lusts that would help us find fertile mates, appetites for sugar that would help us maintain body weight, and minds favoring snap judgments to evade snakes and sabretooth tigers. We also had perfect spines for being on our feet all day.</p>
<p>But there is a major difference between us and the fennec. We no longer live in the environments to which we were originally adapted. Backs evolved to walk for kilometers in the savannah now slouch on office chairs; eyes honed to detect wild berries now focus in on another slice of polenta cake.</p>
<p>There have, it is true, been a few changes in our DNA over the last 60,000 years. Humans living in the Arctic have evolved to carry thicker layers of fat on their faces to reduce the risk of frostbite. Rice-and wheat-cultivating populations have gained an ability to better digest starch thanks to the salivary enzyme amylase. Around 6,000 years ago, a mutation in the OCA2 gene tweaked levels of melanin in northern populations and gave some of them blue eyes.</p>
<p>But no animal on earth whose original habitat has altered as radically as ours has survived while evolving as little as we have. We are doing well enough, but we should be forgiving when aspects of our historically evolved constitutions interact awkwardly with distinctive features of modernity. We are, at points, like a fennec forced to live in Hampshire, an African elephant trying to make its way in Baden-Württemberg, or a tropical rock lobster making a go of it in the waters off Antarctica.</p>
<p>Genetic evolution moves a lot less quickly than human history, making relics of much about our minds and bodies. It should be no wonder that we often eat too much, watch porn all day, develop backache, tremble at the thought of sharks, and get statistics entirely wrong. Narrowly speaking, it isn’t our fault. It’s just that a lot of who we are and what we want made a lot more sense in a world that no longer exists.</p>

<p>18 The Happy Few</p>
<p>One of the leading ambitions of modern society has been to make as many of life’s pleasures and opportunities open to as many people as possible. “Accessible” has become one of our greatest terms of praise, democracy is our highest political ideal, and inclusivity can feel like our most urgent social aspiration. We retain, by contrast, nothing but contempt and anger for concepts like exclusive, aristocratic, and elite.</p>
<p>But because there is always value in studying what is outlying and contrary, we can in the modern context usefully turn to the example of the French novelist, diarist, and travel writer Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), more commonly known by his pen name Stendhal, author of two of the greatest novels of French literature, Le Rouge et le Noir and La Chartreuse de Parme. Born into a prosperous middle-class family in Grenoble, as a young man Stendhal worked for the Napoleonic regime in a number of minor diplomatic and military roles. But after Bonaparte’s exile, he grew disenchanted with his native country, which he came to associate with illiberalism, prudishness, anger, and cynicism. He knew plenty of people but had few real friends. In company, he had difficulty articulating his thoughtful, sweet, impish nature—the waspish critic Lytton Strachey once described him as someone who combined the penetrating intelligence of a High Court judge with the soft heart and weepy nature of an eleven-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Stendhal was no political reactionary. He wanted the vote to be open to all and for the talented to progress whatever their backgrounds. Nevertheless he became increasingly drawn to the idea of an “aristocracy”—that is, the existence of a distinguished elite who could be favored above others. This had nothing whatsoever to do with an aristocracy of the blood. What Stendhal cared about was an aristocracy of the heart: an elite who knew how to feel, think, long for, connect, and be quiet and sad in ways that few seemed to favor. He came to the view that though modern democratic society proclaimed the equality of all peoples and stridently sought to place everyone on the same footing, the sad reality was that only a narrow group would ever really understand matters in the profound, generous, witty, and kind way that he did.</p>
<p>Stendhal left France for Italy. He moved from Florence to Naples to Rome, eventually serving as the French consul in Trieste and Civitavecchia. It was in Italy that he began to use a phrase with which we still associate him. He remarked, in letters and in books, that he was going to dedicate his work and his life not to the masses, not to society in general, but to “the happy few.” The phrase comes from Shakespeare—a line in Henry V : “we few, we happy few, we band of brothers” but Stendhal gave it his own meaning. He understood by it a minority of people, all of them his imaginary friends, who had the kind of sensibility he revered though it was very much out of step with modern times: people who were hugely emotionally sensitive, thoughtful, loved to be on their own a lot, adored art and culture, hated political hysteria and vindictiveness, were sexually generous and open, and loved the sort of peaceful, unambitious, aesthetically sensitive life that he had discovered in Italy. People would know they had stumbled upon one of “the happy few” when they saw someone who had often known unrequited love, was full of regrets about their career but couldn’t abide the fierce tactics needed to succeed at it, was moved by Mozart and Correggio, liked to laugh warmly at the tragedies of existence—and might swoon and well up with tears at a building like the Baptistery of St John in the center of Florence, the beauty of which contrasts so sharply with the chaos and ugliness of the world at large, and which had especially touched Stendhal by its graceful symmetry.</p>
<p>The Baptistery, Florence, Italy, c. 1890–1900.</p>
<p>We often feel wretched for thinking, in our hearts, that we don’t like many people, that most of those we meet are disappointing, and that we don’t hold out much hope for the future of our species. It isn’t fun to be misanthropic in a modern, upbeat, excited democracy. But we can in dejected moods turn to Stendhal as our own imaginary friend who will never punish us for our reservations. We may not even be misanthropes at all; we may just secretly, without having known it ourselves, have all along belonged to that narrow aristocracy of the heart: the happy few. Cynics are only idealists with awkwardly high standards. No wonder we have been so lonely—and how hopeful to think that we might no longer always have to be so.</p>
<p>19 Astronomy and Melancholy</p>
<p>It is a mark of the melancholy mind to be unable to side neatly with dominant ideas of what is supposed to count. We know well enough what we’re meant to care about: our careers, the gossip around us, the opinions of the community, the latest stories in the news, our identities in the eyes of others, where the human race is headed in the next decade. We know the purported significance, but we may also, in a private part of our mind, feel at odds with our collective struggles and excitements, peering at them as though through dense glass, distanced from the passions held so dear by those around us. Without anything urgent or despairing being meant by this, we may not feel immensely bothered whether we live or die.</p>
<p>In such moods, we may be advised to shake ourselves from our torpor and rejoin the clamor, the ecstasy, and the panic. But another move might be to try to honor, and then deepen, the origins of our intuitions. We’re not merely cold or unfeeling. It’s just that we have ended up prone to seeing our species and our planet from a less human-centric perspective. Our eyes naturally settle not on what is directly in front of us but on how we might appear from 6 billion kilometers away. We’re thinking not of what tomorrow will bring but of how the present moment might seem in relation to the age of the Earth.</p>
<p>The natural place to take such feelings of disengagement is not—as society sometimes tells—us a psychotherapist’s chair, but rather our planetariums and our departments of astronomy, our charts of the lunar surface and our galleries of images from the Voyager space probes. We may redeem our disconsolate intuitions with the help of the swirls of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 236,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers from the sun, or photographs of late afternoon on the Aeolis Palus plain of Mars. Astronomy is the true friend of the melancholy mind, NASA and ESA its presiding deities.</p>
<p>Through our immersion in space, our alienated perspectives can be confirmed and returned to us with dignity. We are allowed to anchor our disengagement with the human drama to the sides of passing meteorites or the moons of Jupiter. Our loneliness can find a true home on the vast, silent dune fields of Sputnik Planitia in the southern hemisphere of Pluto. Some of our sense of loss can be absorbed by the asteroid-pockmarked surface of the moon. Our insignificance can be framed within the context of the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the observable universe.</p>
<p>It can seem that planetariums are trying to show us the stars in order to equip us with the knowledge required one day to become astronauts or physicists. But in truth they offer us a means with which to diminish ourselves in our own eyes. They are a tool with which to take the sting out of our nagging sense of unimportance, our frustration at our modest achievements and our feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>There can be good reasons for us to strive to live in the here and now. But there may be yet more powerful reasons to dwell at least part of the day in the Proterozoic period, 2.5 billion years ago, when single-celled eukaryotes developed deep in the silence of giant undisturbed oceans. We don’t need to blame ourselves unduly if we feel at odds with our nagging fellow humans when we can establish imaginary companionship with some of the many wondrous forms in which life has manifested itself across planetary history, such as the beguiling Psittacosaurus parrot lizard, which lived over 100 million years ago, or its near contemporary, the dog-sized, tuft-tailed, two-legged Chaoyangsaurus.</p>
<p>The best consolation for our sadness at how little ever works out is to cheer ourselves with the thought that the average stable lifespan of a star is only 8 billion years and that our sun has already burned for just under half of that. Soon enough, this middle-aged star’s increased brightness will cause our oceans to evaporate. It will then run out of hydrogen and become a giant red star, expanding as far as Mars and absorbing the whole of our planet, including the atoms of everyone and everything that is annoying us so much today.</p>
<p>We should drown our tears in the ocean of suffering to which every living thing is subject. We should align our feelings of purposelessness with detailed news of the five mass extinctions to have already befallen the planet. To every reversal, we should simply answer that there are 40 billion planetary systems at large in our galaxy. Before every anxiety-inducing date or speech, we should mutter to ourselves, like a talismanic prayer, that the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across and that the most distant known galaxy is GN-z11, 32 billion light years from the restaurant or conference center.</p>
<p>The melancholy mind often suspects that everything may be a bit meaningless. Through astronomy, we can discover, in the most engaging and inadvertently life-affirming way possible, why and how it truly is exactly that.</p>

<p>20 Winter</p>
<p>Every year, nature quietly takes us through a moral lesson that has much to teach us about how we might relate to certain of the more dispiriting and despair-inducing moments in our own development. Beginning in mid-October in the northern hemisphere, the temperature drops, the nights draw in, the earth turns cold and hard, fog lies low over the land, and rain drives hard across the austere, comatose gray-brown landscape. There is nothing immediate we can hope for. We now have nothing to do but wait, with resigned patience, until something better shows up.</p>
<p>Far more than we generally accept, our minds too have cycles. We cannot be permanently fruitful or creative, excited or open. There are necessary times of retrenchment when, whatever we might desire, there seems no alternative but to stop. We can no longer be productive. We lose direction and inspiration. We are immovably numb and sterile.</p>
<p>It can be easy to panic. Why should such a paralyzed and detached mood have descended on our formerly lively minds? Where have all our ideas and hopes gone? What has happened to our previous animation and gladness?</p>
<p>We should at such times take reassurance from the late November landscape. Certainly things are lifeless, cold, and in suspension. But this is not the end of the story. Earth is like this not as a destination but as a phase. The deadness is a prelude to new life; the fallow period is a guarantor of fecund days to come. All living organisms need to recharge themselves: old leaves have to give way, tired limbs must rest. The dance and ferment could not go on. It may look as if nothing at all is happening, as though this is a trance without purpose. Yet, deep underground, at this very moment, nutrients are being gathered, the groundwork for future ebullience and dynamism is being laid down, another summer is very slowly collecting its strength.</p>
<p>As nature seeks to tell us, we cannot permanently be in flower. We need moments of repose and confusion. There is nothing to fear. Things will re-emerge. We should make our peace with our own midwinters and lean on nature’s wise accommodation to strengthen us in our pursuit of serenity and patience.</p>

<p>21 Not the End</p>
<p>When Spain’s greatest painter completed this drawing he was about eighty and had only two years left to live. He was almost totally deaf, his eyesight was failing, and he couldn’t walk unaided. But he had not given up. He was still making great art, traveling, being read to, deepening his friendships, and, most of all, looking. Despite everything, as he wrote with heartbreaking defiance at the top of the page: Aun aprendo—I’m still learning.</p>
<p>Francisco de Goya, Aun aprendo (I’m Still Learning), c. 1826.</p>
<p>What was he still learning? Not so much about art; he knew most of what there was to know in that field. He was learning the large, central, ostensibly simple but always elusive lessons that life insists on: about forgiveness, the importance of courage, the need to appreciate the beauty of the world, saying yes again and again to the universe despite the horrors, making time for small children, the beauty of lemons and olives, and the tenderness of dusk.</p>
<p>Such lessons are never complicated in themselves once we mention them. It’s the remembering and the feeling that are hard. Great art strives to convince us in our bones of things that are, intellectually, very basic: love today, don’t lose yourself to grudges, don’t feel singled out by sadness, let joy overwhelm you, don’t be afraid, resist bitterness, care less about what other people think.</p>
<p>The aged, hobbit-like Goya advancing toward us on his sticks has a twinkle in his eye. He is indomitable. He has come out of bed, even though cautious voices told him not to, because he wants another look at the world. There’s a park he wants to visit, a bookstore he’s heard about, a friend he wants to see. Death may be calling but he won’t listen. He is ancient, he can’t walk straight, he winces in pain but he retains the curiosity and energy of his very young self.</p>
<p>We have wasted a lot of time. We have refused to learn so much and on so many occasions. We have been flighty, stubborn, blinkered, dull, and hard-hearted. But our spirit isn’t vanquished—which is why we’re here. There are so many pictures left to see and ideas to recall and rehearse.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too late for him—and it isn’t too late for us.</p>
