        <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I’d like to thank Alain de Botton for his faith in me that I could write a self-help book and for continuing that faith when I was short of it myself. I am grateful to various readers for their encouragement and feedback: Julianne Appel-Opper, Dorothy Charles, Lynn Keane, Nicola Blunden, Daisy Goodwin, Stuart Paterson, Galit Ferguson, Jane Phillimore and Morgwn Rimel.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the Pan Macmillan team, Liz Gough, Tania Adams and Will Atkins for their editing skills. Thank you to Marcia Mihotich for her illustrations and for being a pleasure to work with. I am grateful to Gillian Holding for a useful anecdote. I am very much indebted to Stella Tillyard for all her reading of various stages of the manuscript and her belief, encouragement, friendship and practical help. Any errors in this work are all mine. I am deeply grateful to my loving husband, Grayson, and daughter, Flo, who help to keep me sane, every day.</p>
