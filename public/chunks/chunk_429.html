            <h3>Our children</h3>
<p>We believe – perhaps understandably – that one of the central requirements of being a good parent is to not, at any cost, visibly fail. We undertake enormous efforts to hide our vulnerability to error, foolishness and disaster. We don’t tell our children about the tensions at work and our fear of being sacked; we don’t reveal how difficult our relationship is and how often we feel defeated and alone; we don’t mention to them that we are afflicted by compulsions and addictions that we can’t overcome. We hold that a good parent must appear at all times serene, composed, knowledgeable and wise.</p>
<p>These moves are certainly well meant and easy to sympathise with. But in extremis, they also do our children a grave injustice. The task of a parent isn’t to shelter a child from all failure, but to induct them into the likelihood of mess-ups with reassurance, intelligence and love – to teach them that failure belongs to everyone and that it is possible to be at once kind, clever, idiotic and uncontrolled.</p>
<p>Though we may hope to insulate our children from our failures, the likelihood is that they will sense their presence anyway – but without the help of commentary or honesty. They will sense our depression and anxiety. They will know that something is up over the dinner table. They will have an intuition that there is trouble. The risk is that unless we are open about what is actually happening, they will do what children who are witness to difficulty always do: blame themselves. They will see their depressed and silent father or anxious and irritable mother and come to the most tempting – and in their eyes, logical – conclusion: that they themselves must be wicked, that they must have done something wrong, that they stand in error.</p>
<p>What’s more, if we have truly fooled them skilfully, the danger also opens up that our children will start to feel painfully unique in the extent of their own failures and errors. In the context of their lives, they know well enough about their own greed, their own irritability, their own meanness, their own impulsiveness – and yet when they see no correlates for these troubling patterns in the people they admire most, they end up feeling guilty and unique. It seems that their beloved parents don’t share in any of their frailties. We are seemingly only ever even-tempered, generous and thoughtful. The child then starts to feel exceptionally bad – in relation to people doing too well at pretending to be completely good.</p>
<p>We do our children an enormous favour when we are able to fail in front of them, unambiguously and with a measure of calming commentary; if we can take them aside and share with them our actual circumstances: that we have been passed over for promotion, that we have stupidly lost some money in an ill-advised scheme, that we’re finding it difficult to control our appetites or our temper. They know the problems anyway, in the vague but clever way that children do, but what an immense relief it will be for them to find an explanation for their intuitions in our own patient words. No child needs a perfect parent; they need a parent who feels real, who can be honest, who doesn’t blame them – and who knows how to say sorry when they need to.</p>
<p>Our confession will help them to recognise that their parent is something far better than perfect – they are human, as they themselves are. The candid admission of failure allows a child to extend sympathy and compassion. Their parent isn’t angry with them, isn’t depressed because of something they did, isn’t mean or mysteriously vengeful; they are merely self-disgusted, self-hating and utterly confused.</p>
<p>It might seem like a disorienting concept for a child, but it is far less so than a disguised failure who only serves to alienate them from reality and to deny them the right to truthful explanations. A child would far prefer to know that a parent is in trouble than to fear that the problem lies only with them.</p>
<p>A parent who fails is giving a child a gift of sorts. They allow them to discover that failure is part of every life. They’re offering their child something more important than an unblemished childhood: a sincere one, and an induction into how to approach their own darker sides, which they will come across soon enough. By being perfect, a parent is not being perfect; they’re making the child feel ashamed of a proclivity to failure that should be recognised as properly universal.</p>
