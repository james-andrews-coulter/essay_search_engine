        <h2>Alcobaga Monastery</h2>
<p>An hour’s drive north of Heson, in the hills a few kilometres from the coast, lies the picturesque town of Alcobaga, famous for hosting what is perhaps Portugal’s most beautiful work of architecture: the Alcobaga Monastery, founded in 1178 by King Afonso | and constructed over the next two centuries in the austere, undecorated style of the Cistercians. It’s been a museum since Portugal banned religious orders in 1834, but still powerfully conveys its original atmosphere. We can look around the monks’ bedrooms, their tiled dining room, their enormous pared-down church (more like a cathedral) and their solemn cloister, the Cloister of Silence, with its columns carved in the shapes of fantastical animals and its views out onto an immaculate garden and a trickling Renaissance water basin.
By the end of the visit, we might register an unfamiliar and somewhat peculiar feeling for which nothing has directly prepared us and which it might be hard to interpret or share successfully with our travelling companions (intent on making it to nearby Nazaré for lunch): the building is calling to us. Quite what it’s saying is indistinct, but it’s something about changing our career, the importance of silence and reflection, living more closely with people who share our values and dedicating ourselves to a greater degree of thoughtfulness. And conversely, it seems to be rebuking us [in the Most polite way) for other things: for our hunger for approval, for squandering our energies, for the frivolity and superficiality of our social lives.
It isn’t that we would literally want to become a monk; we hate rules, we don’t believe his We love to lie in. But that’s not how encounters with the past should work; we shouldn’t need to re ihe totality of an era or a creed to be able ow Important benefit from it. on sen it comes to knowing how &amp; ae a history, we’re often presented with Wkward options. The first, naive one, that Owes much to a child’s imagination, is that we try to lose ourselves in another age entirely: that we picture ourselves as a monk writing out passages of the Bible on vellum, or a Viking leading a brave band of soldiers, or a princess Preparing for marriage in a castle in ancient Japan. The other, apparently more sensible approach, is to put aside all our own concerns and dedicate ourselves to the facts and the data without the intrusion of our personalities: history for history’s sake.
The point is neither to go down the path of escapism nor to commit ourselves to rigorous scholarship. We should use history for inspiration; to lend encouragement to sides of our nature and to ideas which our own times have unfairly neglected.
However comfortable we are with the present, there will be parts of us that more fairly belong elsewhere in Tith-century West Africa or 17th-century India, in the writings of a medieval Alexandrian poet or the song cycle of a German Romantic composer in ways that we should strive to understand and accommodate. Some of the mission of our travels should be to bolster the unsupported parts of ourselves by bringing them into contact with more developed instances of our own latent tendencies. In the car on the way to lunch in Nazaré, we might still under the influence of the monastery think of a range of modest but important ways in which our lives could be altered in the direction of greater focus, sincerity and reflection. We aren’t going to join a religious order, but we might vow to switch off our phones completely for twenty-four hours once a week, look for a more tight-knit and honest group of friends or think of how we might live with far fewer belongings somewhere that could be at once basic and yet dignified. Without anyone noticing, we’ll have started to do true justice to history by learning to borrow from it.</p>
