        <h2>Loneliness &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>It remains unhelpfully difficult to be able to admit that one is lonely. Unless one has recently been widowed or just moved to a new city, there are no respectable-sounding explanations for why someone would find themselves without a sufficient number of friends. The idea quickly forms that a person’s loneliness must be explained by something diseased and troubling within their character. If they are lonely, it is because there are things in their nature that merit them being left alone.</p>
<p>Yet in reality, what makes someone feel lonely isn’t usually that they have no one at all they can be with, but that they don’t know a sufficient number of people who could understand the more sincere and quirk-filled parts of themselves. A warm body with whom to have a meal isn’t hard to find; there is always someone with whom one might have a chat about the weather. But loneliness doesn’t end the moment one is talking with someone. It ends when a companion is able to follow us as we reveal our pains and sorrows.</p>
<p>We stop feeling lonely when, at last, someone is there to hear how perplexing sex remains, how frightening death is, how much envy one feels, how many supposedly small things spark anxiety, how much one sometimes hates oneself, how weepy one can be, how much regret one has, how self-conscious one feels, how complex one’s relationship to one’s parents is, how much unexplored potential one has, how odd one is about different parts of one’s body and how emotionally immature one remains. It’s the capacity to be honest about these potentially embarrassing and little-spoken-of sides of human nature that connects us to others and finally brings our isolation to an end.</p>
<p>It’s often said that we have built a lonely modern world. If this is so, it has nothing to do with our busy working schedules or gargantuan cities. It has to do with the fictions we tell ourselves about what we’re like. We trade in brutally simplified caricatures, which leave out so much of our real natures – so much of the pain, confusion, wildness and extremity. We’re lonely because we can’t easily admit to other people what we know we’re really like. We tell stories about what we’ve been up to lately that capture almost nothing of our truth – not because we are liars, but because we are ashamed of the gap between what we know of ourselves and what we are meant to be like. We’re encouraged to present a cheerful, one-dimensional front from which everything awkward but essential has been planed off.</p>
<p>A first step towards ending loneliness would be to open the more secret doors of our minds by ourselves and step into the sad, angry, envious or self-hating rooms – turn on the lights and examine the contents without prudishness or denial, shame or guilt. Then, when we are next with someone else, we should risk discussing what we have found.</p>
<p>We are lonely because we have collectively been slow to accept that we are delightfully strange and unhinged. We should allow ourselves to reveal more of who we really are to those with the imagination to listen, and to allow them to bring their own weirdness to the table in turn. Our loneliness will end with honesty.</p>
