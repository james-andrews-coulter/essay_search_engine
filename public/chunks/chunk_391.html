        <h2>5. Learn Something by Heart</h2>
<p>If you haven’t learned anything by heart since you left primary school, here are a few easy ‘starters’: your favourite poem (this is easiest if it rhymes, or
  at least has a strong regular rhythm); one of Shakespeare’s soliloquies; the 7 times-table; the tube stations on the Circle Line; your regular telephone numbers in the order of most frequent
  use; (part of) Martin Luther King’s 1963 ‘I have a dream’ speech.</p>
