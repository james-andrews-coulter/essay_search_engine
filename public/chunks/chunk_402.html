            <h3>Workplace failure</h3>
<p>For the first two highly influential decades of our lives, we are required to work a lot without ever really needing to ask ourselves any of the bigger questions about what this work means: whether the work is right for us or helps us to make a contribution we welcome or can identify with. We just put our heads down and make our way through the educational obstacle course as best we can. But once we graduate, we are thrown off guard. Without warning, the options become more perilous – even as the silence about how to choose from them grows. We want, naturally, to make a comfortable living, but most of us will feel we have failed if our work doesn’t at the same time provide us with a feeling of deep satisfaction and meaning. Too often, we confront a choice: between head and heart, between what we ideally want to do and what it would be sensible to settle for. Immediately, the ingredients for failure start to brew. There are those who overestimate their talents, and end up in middle age, broke and disappointed, envious and angry. There are those who underestimate the pull of authentic ambition, and end up materially comfortable, but dissatisfied, ashamed of their cowardice and longing to make changes they cannot afford. We are strung between the pull of safety on the one hand and of fulfilment on the other, each one with a viable claim on us, neither providing us with enough on its own, and with the world rarely willing to offer us both. We need to be very fortunate not to regret having been either excessively weak-willed or excessively foolhardy.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that we are called upon to make the most important choices without the relevant experience needed and without properly understanding ourselves or the conditions of the job market. With little awareness of the seriousness of what we are doing, we accept a position ‘for a year or two’, only to find two decades later that this shunted us onto a track that we have never been able to escape. We don’t sense doors closing; we don’t even know where the doors are. There seem to be few people with the relevant experience and patience to talk to. Instead, we wind up sitting at home on Sunday evenings, quietly panicked about the years passing, sensing that something large is not right about our direction but without the courage or resources to know what to do next.</p>
<p>Even if we have had the good fortune to know what our ideal destiny would be, we need to be very lucky indeed for the economy not to trample on our hopes. In almost every field we might consider, there are far more candidates than there are positions. The world is not waiting for yet another author or psychotherapist, furniture designer or anthropologist. Success requires a rare combination of talent and stubborn grit and relentlessness. We may fail not because we lack vision or talent, but because our hearts are too tender.</p>
<p>There is something structural to our misfortune, too: the capitalist marketplace requires that a good portion of its participants fall by the wayside every year. Weaker companies and participants must be eradicated; obstacles to lower prices and efficiency must be removed. Progress demands culls. Customers can only be satisfied if the weaker producers are identified, exposed and winnowed out. The anxiety of our age isn’t simply an unfortunate aberration: it is the leading emotion that should logically accompany us into the office.</p>
<p>Further risks abound in the dynamics between workers. There are bullying managers, uncooperative colleagues, undermining subordinates. There is jealousy, backbiting, gossip and persecution. The very quality that we need in our work – ambition – may be what alienates us from other, more lackadaisical workers who won’t lose an opportunity to bring us down when they can. The workforce pyramid has very steep sides and the tumbles are brutal and terminal. We will need an implausible degree of luck not to be stabbed in the back, or at least roughed up in the corridors of power.</p>
