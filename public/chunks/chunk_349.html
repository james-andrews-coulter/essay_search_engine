            <h3>5 Modesty</h3>
<p>One of the more curious features of the modern age is that it coincided with an explosion of interest in flowers. By the 1890s, in the suburbs of both London and Paris, it was estimated that three-quarters of householders were actively engaged in tending to their gardens. The most popular flowers were lilies, daisies, lilacs, tulips and daffodils. Talk of growing flowers is apt to seem ridiculous to most people under thirty.</p>
<p>There are surely more exciting and substantial goals to set our eyes on than the gestation of small colourful temporary bulbs — when, for example, we have romantic love to explore or professional life to succeed at.</p>
<p>But it is almost impossible to find anyone over seventy who does not care for gardening. By then, most people’s ambitions will have taken a substantial hit: love or work will not have worked out in key ways. At this point, the consolation offered by gardening starts to feel very significant. Flowers become something to be cherished precisely because of their lack of exigencies or overt grandeur. The world beyond will always resist our efforts to bend it to our will, but in the garden, with some effort, regular watering and some luck with the sun, we can for brief weeks be the midwives to something as visually seductive as it is cheering. We are moved by the flowers’ tender beauty because we know, by this stage, so much about pain and disappointment; we aren’t sentimental so much as traumatised. We won’t turn down this one of nature’s gifts. It isn’t the largest, but it may — on a mild summer evening — be very much good enough.</p>
<p>Vincent van Gogh, Garden at Arles, 1888.</p>
<p>Those who wished to protect nature from modernity’s destructiveness have often made powerful appeals to people’s altruism; they have evoked the suffering of other species and the needs of as yet unborn generations. But it is rarely a winning strategy to try to get through to the selfish by appeals to their conscience; it may simply be wiser to target their self-interest.</p>
<p>We don’t need to make impassioned speeches begging the drillers and the loggers to be good. We need only point out the cost to themselves, and more specifically to their mental well-being. There may be other ways to get healthy besides going to the park, but it is hard to imagine a species maintaining even a semblance of mental equilibrium without, somewhere in the picture, some very mighty trees, a mallard duck, or a team of weaver ants.</p>
