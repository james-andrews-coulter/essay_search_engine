            <h2>Superfluity &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>The world is hardly short of people. Quite why it needs yet another example, and why that example should be someone like us (with all our flaws, compulsions and mediocrities), is one of the conundrums that especially haunt those of us beset by melancholy. For these mournful souls, the first-order questions are never far away. Why are we here? What have we contributed? Are we worthy enough? Wouldn’t it be better for us not to have been born?</p>
<p>It is these harsh enquiries that reverberate in melancholy minds and lends them their characteristically deep, sad and self-doubting expressions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real puzzle isn’t so much why some people doubt their existence as why certain others manage not to do so in any way. What lends these less sceptical characters their confidence that they have every right to be here? How do they manage to root their legs so firmly to the ground and why do they greet their face in the mirror with such a spirit of self-acceptance and vivid assurance? Why do they feast unquestioningly on the goodness of the Earth and never wonder if there hasn’t, somewhere along the line, been some mistake?</p>
<p>At the root of the melancholic cast of mind there is likely to be a poignant psychological backstory in childhood: a lack of early love. No one who has been firmly and decisively wanted by those who put them on the Earth will ever doubt their essential right to be here. They will be permanently validated by the enthusiasm of their parents. These parents’ songs and cuddles, laughter and care will strengthen them forever. They may suffer in all kinds of ways, and they won’t be immune to a thousand pains and regrets that beset every human over the years, but they will never know the fundamental self-doubt that afflicts those whose parents didn’t really want them. They will have a gift for speaking to themselves kindly and will look after their needs with tenderness during reversals. They will look benignly on their errors and forgive themselves in the way they were once forgiven. They will look after their own bodies and tuck themselves into bed in good time. They will suffer, but they won’t hate themselves.</p>
<p>How different it is for the melancholic. In their childhood, it is likely no one was especially waiting for them to arrive; there was no emotional red carpet and no boundless admiration for their sweet toes and adorable eyelashes. No one was ready to lay down their life for their sake, or gaze at them with tender awe as they filled a bucket in the garden. A child doesn’t have to be thrown into a dustbin to count as neglected. It may be regularly bathed and adequately dressed. There are subtler ways for an impression to form that one doesn’t especially matter to anyone. The parents might have been very busy or the childminder often on the phone. Perhaps one’s birth coincided with serious problems at the office. Or else a sibling got ill and there was only so much concern left over. Or maybe one was a bit difficult, slow and shy and the parent looked elsewhere in embarrassment.</p>
<p>All this is enough to kick-start a worldview. It could, by itself, make one into a philosopher, someone who spends their life raising troubling structural questions, starting with the most urgent of them all: why am I even here?</p>
<p>It sounds insulting to have to believe that seventy-five years of gloom and self-questioning might have its origin in a lack of cuddles or bedtime stories before the age of four. Nevertheless, we would do well to accept the power of so-called ‘small things’ to determine the course of our lives – no less than we should humbly acknowledge the power of microscopic cell division to determine our biological fates.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic parental love is founded on a charming illusion: of course one doesn’t – in the grander scheme – matter at all; of course one isn’t especially cute or particularly worthy; naturally there isn’t something fundamentally amazing about one’s first steps or one’s return home from school with a sticker for good behaviour in maths. Still, how pleasant and necessary for parents to weave around a child an aura of affection in order to inoculate them for life against stabs of self-doubt and self-hatred.</p>
<p>What gives the melancholy their clear-eyed intelligence – and often their dark humour – is that they have never had any illusory veil thrown over them. They have had to look at matters pretty clearly from the start. They haven’t trusted teachers or many friends, and they have been suspicious of casual declarations of love. They’ve known how to be ironic and keep a keen eye out for pretension; such are the side benefits of not being too much on one’s own side. The world is far more cruel, but also more interesting. And there will always be low moods when the whole thing doesn’t seem worth it at all. That initial feeling of being unwanted persists forever. The great consolation is to know that we are not alone, that there is – blessedly – a silent community of people a bit like us, just waiting for art and friendship to bring us together.</p>
