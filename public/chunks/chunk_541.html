            <h3>¶ Addiction</h3>
<p>We operate with some stock images of the addict: a person with a heroin needle in a park, or who nurses a bottle of gin in a paper bag at nine in the morning, or who sneaks off at every opportunity to light up another joint of marijuana.</p>
<p>However dramatic and tragic such cases of addiction might be, they are simultaneously hugely reassuring to most of us – because they locate the addict far from ordinary experience, somewhere off-stage, in the land of semi-criminality and outright breakdown.</p>
<p>The School of Life defines addiction in another way: as the manic reliance on something, anything, to keep our darker or more unsettling thoughts and feelings at bay. What properly indicates addiction is not what someone is addicted to, because we can get addicted to pretty much anything. It is the motives behind a reliance on a certain element – and, in particular, our attachment to it as a way of avoiding encounters with the contents of our own minds and hearts.</p>
<p>For most of us, facing up to ourselves is a deeply anxiety- inducing prospect. We are filled with thoughts we don’t want to entertain and feelings we are desperate not to feel. There is an infinite amount that we are angry and sad about that it would take an uncommon degree of courage to face. We experience a host of fantasies and desires that we have a huge incentive to disavow because of the extent to which they violate our self-image and our more normative commitments.</p>
<p>We should not pride ourselves because we aren’t injecting something into our veins. Almost certainly, we are doing something else to take us away from ourselves. We are checking the news at four-minute intervals to keep the news from ourselves at bay. We’re doing sport, exhausting our bodies in the hope of not having to hear from our minds. We’re using work to get away from the true internal work that we’re shirking.</p>
<p>To overcome addiction, we need to lose our fear of our minds. We need a collective sense of safety around confronting loss, humiliation, sexual desire and sadness.</p>
<p>On the other side of addiction is philosophy – understood as the patient, unfrightened, compassionate examination of the contents of our minds.</p>
