        <h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>There are couples that seem never to argue. Their relationships are marked by enormous outward politeness; they say thank you a lot; they make each other cups of tea; they can look rather horrified when there’s a mention of a squabble in someone else’s life. It’s understandable if they’re privately a little pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>But surface harmony isn’t, in reality, any reliable sign of health in love because it’s impossible to try to merge two lives without regularly encountering deep sources of incompatibility. A lack of arguments is more likely to be a sign that we have given up caring than a superhuman achievement of maturity.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t, therefore, to do away with arguments – but to find our way towards their more fruitful variety. We need to learn to argue well, rather than not argue at all.</p>
<p>What then are some of the ideas that might help us have better arguments?</p>
<p>– The single greatest idea that can help us to argue more constructively is to remind ourselves publicly that we are – both of us – by nature deeply imperfect and at points quite plainly mad.</p>
<p>– People concede points not when they’re aggressively told they’re wrong, but when they feel loved. It is indispensable to preface every criticism with an assurance of our ongoing love.</p>
<p>– People change very slowly, and seldom when they are harassed into doing so. We must strive not to be desperate for change.</p>
<p>– We shouldn’t aggravate our frustration by a sense that we have been uniquely cursed in ending up in this relationship. The specifics of why we’re in an irritating dispute may be local, but that we are in one is a universal destiny.</p>
<p>– Our partner is only ever frightened, worried and not thinking straight – rather than bad.</p>
<p>– Choose the moment.</p>
<p>– Don’t let the relationship die from misplaced ‘politeness’ or embarrassment. Dare to name the problem, however shocking it sounds.</p>
<p>– It doesn’t matter if we’re right.</p>
<p>The capacity to be horrible to a partner is a strange – though genuine – feature of love. A relationship has to include the madder, more unreasonable parts of our nature; if we are only ever polite, it’s because we have not been made to feel safe. A row may have to be the turbulent passage towards the kind of deeper reconciliation we long for. It can be important to say some wild and hurtful things to halt a drift apart. By foregrounding for a while the most extreme points of conflict, we set up the conditions for reconnecting with larger areas of closeness. We now remember that, despite an evening squabbling like the frightened, foolish, barely semi-rational idiots we are, we love them deeply nevertheless – and will strive with all our will to argue a little more sensibly next time.</p>
