        <h3>¶ Snobbery</h3>
<p>Snobbery is a method of judging people not according to the totality of their being, but with reference to a punishingly narrow range of criteria.</p>
<p>In the modern world, the operative criteria of judgement are work and money. In the past, snobs might have wanted to know a person’s family lineage; now, they are focused on what they do for a living, and then judge their entire worth upon this piece of information. One of the first questions that a snob may ask of a stranger at a party is, ‘And what do you do?’ According to how the question is answered, they will either grow solicitous and animated, or will abandon the unfortunate low-status figure to a solitary fate by the nuts.</p>
<p>The more prevalent snobbery happens to be, the more our income and status start to matter. We are not being materialistic; we simply recognise that certain emotional rewards (a feeling of being valued, respected, honoured) will only be available to us via material goods. It isn’t the material goods we want so much as the ‘love’ that results from their possession.</p>
<p>In principle, the snob is asking an important question: how impressive or good is a person? But they are brutally misguided in how they set about answering it. For snobs, it is the already acclaimed and already successful who are the only ones worthy of respect. There is no room to imagine that someone might be clever, kind or good, and yet have somehow been entirely overlooked by society. Snobs don’t sign The Beatles, don’t invest in the startup iteration of Google or Apple, don’t give the time of day to the taxi driver who might one day be the president, or to the old lady in a woolly hat who is writing the great novel of the 21st century – or might simply be a rather lovely person.</p>
<p>The true answer to snobbery is not to say that there is no such thing as a better or worse person, but to insist that ‘better or worse’ exist in constantly unexpected places and carry none of the outward signs of distinction. Because we are such poor judges of the worth of others, our ultimate duty remains to be kind, good, curious and imaginative about pretty much everyone who might ever cross our path.</p>
