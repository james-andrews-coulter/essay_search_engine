        <h2>VII: THE EVE-OF-JOURNEY ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>Our partner is about to go away on a long trip for work. We’re going to miss them a lot. We love them very much. We have only one more evening together. We’re going to make sure it’s a lovely one. Maybe we’ll go out to the local Chinese restaurant or cook one of their favourite dishes and then watch a romantic comedy.</p>
<p>Except that’s not how it turns out at all. Just as they’re packing their bags, we get embroiled in a fight about their toothbrush, or what time we said we’d be ready to eat, or where the phone chargers are kept. The issue isn’t really significant for us, but we feel – from a mysterious place – a willingness to get vindictive and unusually cross. We dial up the tension even though there’s seemingly no imperative to do so; they are repeatedly conciliatory, but we deliberately drive things on in a negative direction until finally we are in a fight. The dinner gets called off, one of us slams a door and someone calls someone an idiot.</p>
<p>What could possibly lead us to behave in such a peculiar way at the very moment when we’re about to say goodbye? Why spoil the remaining few hours? What’s happening is that our yearning for love is meeting with a dark, intimate dread: that we are deeply dependent on a lover who we don’t control, whose affection is out of our command and who is about to be taken away from us for a long time. We feel so vulnerable about their impending absence that, with a fruitless immaturity we probably aren’t even fully aware of, we decide to reinvent what they mean to us in the first place. We choose to hate and therefore not miss them as an alternative to suffering from the intensity of our love for someone we can’t possess entirely.</p>
<p>By squabbling, we are attempting some drastic surgery on our emotions: If only we can convince ourselves that we don’t want their love, it may stop mattering so much to us that they won’t be on the same continent to give it to us. If we reject them, their symbolic rejection of us, however unwilled (rationally we know that, that this is a trip they had no option but to go on), is cancelled out.</p>
<p>We would, of course, be wiser to endure their loss than attempt to stop it wounding us. We are due some suffering in any case; better that it should be over the real issue (that they’ll be eight time zones away by tomorrow night) rather than its proxy (that they were a little impolite when asking if we’d seen their washbag).</p>
