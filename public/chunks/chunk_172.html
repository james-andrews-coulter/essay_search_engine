        <h2>20.The Pleasures of Nature</h2>
<p>One of the most consoling aspects of travel is that we are likely to encounter nature in a way we don’t in the rest of our lives. Natural phenomena – it might be the ocean, a sheep, a forest or a valley – have nothing whatsoever to do with our own perilous and tortured human priorities. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and self-absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest sense of our role on the planet.</p>
<p>A sheep doesn’t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never emailed. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we’re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were chewing gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool, and for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused glance.</p>
<p>Beyond the sheep are a couple of oak trees. They are of especially noble bearing; they gather their lower branches tightly under themselves while their upper branches grow in small orderly steps, producing a rich green foliage in an almost perfect circle. It doesn’t matter if there’s an election or what happens to the stock market or in the final exams. The same patterns of growth would have been going on when Napoleon was leading his armies across Europe or when the first nomads made their way towards the Appalachian hills.</p>
<p>Our encounter with nature calms us because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes has any relevance to it. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the ocean, the sheep, the trees, the clouds or the stars; they are deeply important representatives of an entirely different perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.</p>
