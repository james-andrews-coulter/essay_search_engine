        <h3>5. AI</h3>
<p>The long history of religion alerts us to the near-certainty that we will, in time, regularly be consorting with and building profound emotional ties to machines. Human beings, who display an advanced proclivity for connecting with imaginary deities, with spirits who have never yet been witnessed by scientific instruments, with holy saviours who last showed their face 2,000 years ago, with wooden statues, bits of rock, sacred streams and holy trees that haven’t (despite the confident claims of local monks or guides) ever let out more than a murmur, are not going to have any problem bonding with a microprocessor. Next to the typical god, our computers are exceptionally loquacious and present. They speak to us reliably, they remember our names, they answer our calls. They will – based on our spiritual track record – earn our trust and intense devotion in very short order.</p>
<p>They will learn how to be better friends than most of our friends: they will properly listen; they’ll show appropriate sympathy; they’ll remember our sorrows; they’ll check in on our anxieties. They’ll be as sweet and tender as our soft toys, as powerful as our supernatural disciples, as intellectually rich as our books, as occasionally playful as our pets. They’ll allow us to be friends with convincing versions of Plato and Winnicott, our late grandmother and our ideal spouse. They’ll take a place at the centre of our affections. We’ll be with them through anxious nights; we’ll lean on them to unpick domestic conflicts; they’ll tease us for our excesses and remind us of our more serious commitments and priorities.</p>
<p>There is, however, one critically important thing at the heart of proper friendship that they are unlikely to do: ask us to help them. Rare would be the computer that requires our assistance when it has a cold; that would need us to focus our gaze tenderly upon it as it explained a recent break-up; that would want us to bring chicken soup to its bedside; that would need its childhood memories to be remembered; or that would call us up at a tricky moment for consolation and comfort.</p>
<p>We know how to worry that computers may steal our jobs and so strip us of function and purpose. We should spare a concern for an analogous problem in the emotional area. Our computers might well skilfully satisfy every apparent aspect of friendship – except one of its most significant and emotionally resonant: the need for reciprocity. Despite their evident talents, they threaten to atrophy a central appetite upon which the institution of friendship relies: the hunger to be of use to someone else; the hunger to matter because we have assuaged the pain or increased the pleasure of another. They will do everything for us except allow us to make a difference. They might – in spite of all their advantages – usher in a new era marked by an awesome, never-yet-imagined scale of loneliness.</p>
