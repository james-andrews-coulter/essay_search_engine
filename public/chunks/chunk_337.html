            <h3>1 Perspective: the scale of the universe</h3>
<p>We are at permanent risk of losing perspective, of making more of our troubles, hopes, fears and status than is warranted or good for us. One of our greatest terrors is to be made to ‘feel small’, to be reduced in our own eyes by the inconsiderate or thoughtless actions of others. This is to miss that the solution to our agitation does not lie in expanding our importance, but in learning to reduce it ever further. Peace of mind does not come from finding an indisputable way of enhancing our status; it comes from discovering a sufficiently elevated and distant angle from which to look at everything we are and do in order to understand that we are blessedly and thankfully irrelevant to everything.</p>
<p>Science can help with this adjustment. Humanity used to believe that the Earth was at the centre of the universe, and that we, in turn, were at the centre of creation. Slowly and reluctantly, we came to accept that we might be only one planet among a few others and might be revolving around our sun rather than it around us.</p>
<p>From there, the progress of science has rendered us ever less significant — with enormous theoretical benefit to our psyches and our egos. In 1672, the Italian astronomer Cassini made the first measurement of the distance between two planets — Earth and Mars — and found that the Solar System (still understood as equivalent to ‘the universe’) was an astonishing twenty times larger than the Greek philosophers had thought. Ninety-nine years later, Jérome Lelande accurately estimated the distance between the Earth and the Sun at ninety-three million miles. In 1838, humanity got an indication of the likely scale of the universe when the German astronomer Freidrich Bessel made the first ever correct measurement of the distance to a star: ten light years.</p>
<p>The Milky Way, high above the Church of the Good Shepherd, New Zealand.</p>
<p>We had for a long time imagined that the universe might be a relatively empty place. Around 700 CE, the Dunhuang star chart recorded 1,300 stars seen by Chinese astronomers with the naked eye; John Flamsteed’s 1729 Atlas Coelestis mapped 3,000 stars. By 1903, German astronomers had pushed up the number to 324,000 stars.</p>
<p>But only by the 1960s did we become fully aware of the true scale of our puniness. We understood that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has approximately 100 billion stars in it, that there are ten billion galaxies in the observable universe, each of which contains an average of 100 billion stars, which means that there are around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (a billion trillion) stars at large.</p>
<p>When we lose perspective, as we invariably do in the course of pretty much every day in the frenetic city, we don’t need a philosophy lesson or a church service. We need to spend one or two quiet moments with a photograph from the Hubble Space telescope and a reminder that we are — in a glorious and redemptive way — what we always feared: nothing.</p>
