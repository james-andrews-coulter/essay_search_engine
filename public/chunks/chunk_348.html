            <h3>4 Wonder</h3>
<p>It can be easy to feel bored and listless in modern times. The truly exciting things are often financially and practically out of reach. Nothing about our lives may feel as exciting and as special as it should; we still lack so much.</p>
<p>We didn’t start like this. Once we were three years old and everything was amazing: the light switch, the zip on our jacket, the way a door closed. Since then, our enthusiasm has dropped, but encouragements not to lose a taste for existence abound in the spectacle of nature. Granted, we have not been invited to certain parties, and our job is feeling repetitive — but right now, across parts of Asia and Australia, colonies of weaver ants are building their nests, some of the oddest and most impressive structures that exist. Implausible numbers of these ants, into the many hundreds, will stand with military precision on the edge of a large leaf, and collaborate with others to draw a neighbouring leaf to it with the help of strands of larval silk. They will then harmoniously and diligently sew the two leaves together with their silk thread, building up sealed and watertight structures the size of a human head or larger, in which they set up their meticulously ordered colonies.</p>

<p>We can get bored because we are in a tunnel that we mistake for an open view. We can feel as though we have explored everything we need to know. But we have only to recall that things are far weirder and more stupefying than we in the city ever tend to think — because we are sharing the planet not only with people we went to school with and high-powered television executives but also flying squirrels, hyacinth macaws, vampire crabs, glasswinged butterflies, French angelfish, okapis, nicobar pigeons, rock agamas and tokay geckos — all of which contribute to a gigantic call for us to take a closer, more wondrous and more enchanted look at what breathes around us.</p>
