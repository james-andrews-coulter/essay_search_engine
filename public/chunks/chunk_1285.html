        <h2>Central Park Zoo</h2>
<p>A person would have to be extremely hardhearted to find it ‘fun’ to go to the zoo. Nevertheless, it’s a hugely important activity; shocking, cathartic, necessary like going to a funeral or to visit a friend in prison ora hospice. We aren’t quite the same afterwards, and that’s the point. We should definitely think twice before taking a child.
Seldom has the relationship between humans and animals felt more laden with tragic misunderstanding than in Garry Winogrand’s 1963 picture of a beluga whale and its attendant window cleaner in Central Park Zoo in Manhattan. Extraordinarily, given where it’s ended up far from its natural habitat, in the vicinity of Macy’s and MoMA the beluga seems to bear no grudges; it sports the sort of smile that an upbeat 5-year-old would give it. If it could speak (in our language, for it does well enough in its own), it would chiefly express bemusement: What have you humans dreamt up now? It might sigh like a forgiving grandfather. This morning there were some little ones making faces, and earlier in the week there were some people with gigantic balls of candyfloss trying to offer it lunch {in fact, it eats mostly octopus and walleye pollock). And now this … that stick-like thing might be some sort of weapon, but by this stage, it’s clear to the whale that panic leads nowhere.
Part of the ridiculousness of the man (and by extension the self-important dragnetmaking species to which he belongs) is how dolled up he is for his role. He’s come with a Special hat and quasi-military uniform to clean window for the prison cell of an abducted Arctic cetacean held against its will in a corner of a New York park.
Nevertheless, the beluga maintains only good feelings towards its captor, perhaps because it knows in its clever whale-mind that he is some sort of captive too. This is no life him either. It’s late and he should be at home with his partner (its own is, after all, just next to it). Both are victims.
One impulse might be to try to set the whale free, but it would be tricky. The beluga would never fit in a cab. It would have expired noisily so; they’re known as the ‘canaries of the ocean’ long before we ever reached the East River. For better and for worse, this is its permanent and last home.
In zoos, we look on at animals with bemusement, and they look back at us with pity. It’s never clearer that there may be a mistake about who should be in a cage, enclosure or aquarium or about who deserves to be thought of as the ‘animal’, with all the pejorative associations of that word. The right tone to adopt in zoos is funereal seriousness. We aren’t dreaming. There is something very wrong with our sort, and by looking deep into animals’ eyes, we may start to pick up a few hints as to what that might be.</p>
