        <h3>A good listener doesn’t correct exaggerations</h3>
<p>It’s a rookie error of the poor listener to try to intervene in a partner’s dialogue in order to introduce perspective and nuance, on the basis that this should at all times be present in order for a conversation to flow well. When the partner says that their colleague is ‘a complete tosshead who understands nothing at all’, the poor listener might add that this is ‘a bit of an exaggeration’ because they were pretty good – all told – in their work at the recent conference. Or the partner will accuse their father of understanding ‘not a damn thing about anything’ and the bad listener will bring up that he was fairly good with the neighbours the time they lost the keys.</p>
<p>The normal rules of conversation certainly suggest that we should clearly announce our doubts and disagreements with what another person is saying in order to maintain our integrity and standing. But this is to misunderstand what a lot of conversation in relationships is actually about. Our partners are at key moments not asking for precise corroboration of what they are saying. They don’t want to get to a scientifically verifiable truth. They want us to enter into the spirit rather than the letter of a specific frustration, disappointment or outrage that is tearing at them. Whether or not they are completely right to be feeling a certain way is secondary. What counts is that they do not, at a moment of considerable distress, want to be alone with their pain.</p>
