        <h2>COMMUNION &amp; ANXIETY</h2>
<p>Anxiety and dread thrive in conditions of loneliness. Not only is one wretched, one feels convinced that one is the only one to feel as such. One’s suffering lacks legitimacy in one’s own eyes. To the affliction of anxiety, the burden of shame is too often added.</p>
<p>That is why, when anxiety starts to descend, there is one solution that is more effective than any other, that functions faster than any pill, meditation technique or book: talking to someone kind who knows anxiety from the inside. One needs to get oneself – fast – into a group and unburden oneself among thoughtful and good-natured people who have been visited by comparable pain, and who can respond to your confessions with infinite understanding. It helps immeasurably to sit with folk who know what it’s like to be terrified, not to dare to leave the house, to panic at work, to be triggered by ‘small things’ that others would find innocuous and to be bullied mercilessly by one’s own mind.</p>
<p>Every anxious person would, ideally, equip themselves with a support group and turn to them once a week or more. We’d gather at someone’s house, chat about how things had been going and swap stories of our challenges. We’d in turn recognise some of our most private moments in the stories of others and be granted a rare opportunity to reconceive of ourselves as fundamentally normal and human – though very much afflicted. Our sufferings do not make us unique – they provide an essential opportunity to loosen our fears and bind ourselves together around a commitment to mutual assistance and kindness.</p>
