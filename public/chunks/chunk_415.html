            <h2>How to Deal with the Pity of Friends</h2>
<p>At times of failure, we can expect to be handled with outright disdain and loud hostility by many of the people we encounter. It might, therefore, sound odd to single out as particularly problematic – and especially painful – a kind of treatment that, on the surface, seems like kindness.</p>
<p>When they hear of our disaster, a certain sort of acquaintance will rush to offer us gentle-sounding words. They will ask us with concern how we are doing; they will enquire if they can get us anything at all at what must be a very difficult moment for us; they will say that they can imagine how awful things are and how in agony we must be. They will end a call by entreating us to get in touch with them whenever we want – day or night, weekends too – if they can be of assistance of any kind. They might even briefly sigh and say in a tender voice: ‘Poor you!’</p>
<p>How could we be so ungrateful as to mind this treatment, when other people may at this very moment be calling us an idiot, a lunatic or worse? Yet the latter approach might almost be preferable; however bracing, we would at least know where we stood.</p>
<p>What can make honey-coated kindness unbearable is its entanglement with one of the most pernicious emotions we can ever be on the receiving end of: pity. To be pitied is to be placed in a special category of loneliness; to be accorded pariah status at the very moment when what we long for is solace and a confirmation of our right to belong to the human race. The pitying person recognises how desperate our condition is, but what subverts their efforts to be kind is the energy with which they make it clear that our sorrow is ours and ours alone – and that they will not, and could never be, touched by any similar horror. They want to be sweet to us, of course, but what they will not do is recognise that they are as open to foolishness, accident and suffering as we are. Their fear compels them to create a solid wall between our condition and theirs. They need to remind us, and most importantly themselves, that they are firmly rooted on dry land, while we are out there drowning in the ocean swell. Perhaps they will throw us a small life raft – but what they don’t want is to imagine ever needing one themselves.</p>
<p>Pity is troubling because it lies so close to something we all desperately want, which is sympathy. Both the pity-bearing and the sympathetic person will say ‘poor you’. Both will recognise our troubles, our pain and the extent of our fall. But the pity-bearing person is cruel in their implication that the mess we’re in is only ours. They fail to remind us of the crucial truth, which is a great deal more accurate as well as more humane: that we are all, at all times, a hair’s breadth away from agony.</p>
<p>The pity-bearing friend reminds us of the distinctiveness of our situation because they are not strong enough to accept the trouble they might face in the future. They may visit us in the hospital, but it’s quietly evident that they couldn’t ever picture themselves in such a bleak place. They may help us to pay for our groceries, but heaven forbid they would ever one day have to ask a friend for money in turn.</p>
<p>A truly heart-warming and consoling friend is someone robust and mature enough to be reconciled to their own exposure to pain. They know that though they are not on the ward right now, they might easily be soon enough; they understand that everything we are suffering from could touch them one day too – that our sins have echoes in their own hearts. They understand that they haven’t been granted immunity from folly and horror; they may be fine right now, but they almost certainly won’t be in the end, because life is long and because they are human – and therefore condemned to exquisite kinds of suffering, as we all are. This is the emotional background that will lend their words consolation and their hugs sincerity.</p>
<p>In the end, we should not resent the pity-bearing person. They are not causing us suffering on purpose – and generally they have no clue that they are. They are just very afraid of being like us, not yet accepting that one day they will have to drink from the cup of suffering we’ve been forced to down. We frighten them; we are ghoulish evocations of everything they are in flight from. When we experience pity, we must remind ourselves that we are not imagining a problem; we are right to sense how delicately we are being kept at bay, with an imaginary long stick and surgical gloves. Our pity-bearing friend may have called us up to see how we are, but as we take in their well-muffled terror, we should turn the tables on them and reassert our sense of agency and dignity in the face of their sweetly patronising concern. We are explorers of regions that they are still too brittle and apprehensive to travel to – if anyone is in need of a dose of reassuring kindness, it may be them.</p>
