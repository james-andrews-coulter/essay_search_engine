        <h2>Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange</h2>
<p>The Judge Harry Pregerson Directional Interchange in southern Los Angeles, California, is a four-level, 40-metre-high stack structure that connects US Route 105 with State Route 110. It was opened in 1993 and named after a popular and liberal judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who halted several executions and reduced the lengths of sentences for minor offences.
It is one of the most awe-inspiring structures ever built, but it appears in no guidebooks, it is never spoken about as a work of culture and it remains utterly unobserved by most of the thousands of motorists who use it every day. It works so well that it is invisible along with most of our public infrastructure. We know so much about our singers and actors, our novelists and television presenters, and next to nothing about our junctions and highways, aqueducts and sewage plants.
One result is that it’s very easy to think of ourselves as an irredeemably wicked and meanspirited animal, for we are at our worst in our love affairs, in our social media dramas, in our politics and our entertainments. And we are conversely at our best when we’re linking up high-voltage power lines or carefully threading one highway into another.
The modern world seems perplexing and ugly in part because we stand too close to its wonders. We can be on a four-stack directional interchange turning a corner at 50 miles an hour and have no clue of the beauty we’re partaking in. We’re just in the car having an argument with our partner about the way they said ‘always’. We’re stuck within the circle of our ego. It doesn’t help that nothing is ever explained to us properly. We can’t understand most of the processes that create the structures around us. We don’t know where things have come from, what most buildings are in the landScape or how most of our tools work. We may think this is a matter only for narrow-minded specialists or obsessives; in fact, it’s material for anyone who wants to find reasons not to hate our species.
The point of a directional interchange is to keep cars moving at speed even while they complete what amounts to a 90° turn onto another highway, and it ingeniously overcomes the problem of ‘weaving’, where traffic exiting a road at one junction will interrupt traffic entering from another. Directional interchanges require two pairs of left-turning ramps that have to be raised above the two interchanging highways. To complete a left turn, drivers leave the highway via an exit on the right, go on a 270° loop on a clover-leaf-like ramp that crosses both highways, and then merge with traffic turning right from the opposite side of the interchange.
The world’s first ever four-stack directional interchange, the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange, was built by the California Department of Transportation in 1949 where US Route 101 meets State Route 110. Eight more four-level stacks have since been added in the state and twenty-five others across America. They remain relatively rare anywhere else. There are three in the United Kingdom, one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands, one in Greece, one in South Africa and one in Australia.
None of this is too much about highways in the end. It’s about what we should turn our minds to when we’re very sad.
Julian Hinds Pumping Plant
Driving along Interstate 10, in an empty region of the California desert, 55 miles east of Palm Springs, we can just make out a large rectangular building from which exit three large pipes that climb a third of the way up a barren mountainside before disappearing into the rocks. Nothing encourages us to take notice (there isn’t even a sign on the road), and yet this peculiar bit of obscure and unheralded infrastructure is single-handedly responsible for ensuring that 23 million people across Southern California can have a bath, flush the toilet and water their Canyon Snow irises.
The building is a pumping plant built in 1941 under the supervision of one of the engineers of the Colorado River Aqueduct, Julian Hinds, and is the last of five stations that help propel water from the Colorado River up California’s mountains from a reservoir, Lake Havasu, on the border with Arizona 126 miles away to the east. Inside the building, six gigantic 12,500-horsepower Westinghouse motors work twenty-four hours a day to drive water over 120 metres up the mountain, using electricity drawn from the Hoover Dam at a cost, for this station alone, of some $10 million a year.
It is easy to feel extremely alone. Much about modern life separates us from our fellow humans. But this impression is invariably an illusion, for we remain tightly tied into a discreet web of dependence, simply one to which we struggle to give a name and a shape. Every time we turn on the tap, we are connected to the precise and thoughtful efforts of hundreds of people upstream from us: in Southern California, the controllers at Lake Havasu who monitor our water’s levels and composition, and the engineers who look after the 242 miles that separate Havasu from Lake Mathews, the final reservoir on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The route includes 62 miles of canals, 92 miles of tunnels and 84 miles of buried conduits and
siphons, through which 1,200,000 acre-feet of fresh water flow a year. Only a few days ago, the bathwater that we now lie in lapped the shoreline of a gigantic lake, across which windsurfers glided and through which catfish and bass swam. We may only have drawn a single glass that sits on the table of the eerily quiet kitchen but this modest draught travelled from Arizona in a collective body of water comprising millions and billions of litres, some of which will now be in a vase in the kitchen of a psychiatrist in Playa Vista and another bit of which will fill the yellow bucket of a 3-year-old child in a garden in Montecito Heights. We are not alone.
Buddhism recommends that we regularly strive to leave the prison of the self, with its unfortunate attachments and passions, in order to focus on phenomena outside of ourselves: the sound of birds, the rustle of leaves, the fall of raindrops. We might in homage focus our minds on the drip of the bathroom tap, for it too may provide a route out of the morose culs-de-sac of our nature and lift us into an unsuspected world of pipes and stations that are operated in a collaborative and meticulous spirit of what we
may as well term love.</p>
