            <h2>The Many Types of Failure</h2>
<p>One of the many cruel aspects of failure is that when it strikes, it can feel like the most unusual and particular event. ‘Why did it happen to me?’ we wonder, ‘Why have I been singled out?’ Our failure looks to us like a monstrous exception in an area of life dominated by success – a quite spectacularly strange and rare affliction. We’ve not only failed, we are – it appears – almost completely alone in having done so. Everyone else’s marriage is stable, even terrific; all around us, there are lovers going out on dates and wedding anniversaries being celebrated. Most people’s jobs are continuing without trouble; it’s hardly ‘normal’ to be at a loose end at what should be the height of our career. There’s no evidence that the others around us have lost command of their reason. The name of no one else we went to school with produces search results that render ordinary social life impossible. How have other people managed not to mess up as badly as we have? We might be indoors, crying and hitting the walls or biting our hands, but outside, children are going to playgrounds, birds are singing, suited figures are attending purposeful meetings, families are laughing, youngsters are planning fifty years of success, shopkeepers are wishing their customers a good day and there will be parties to attend at the weekend. We feel like freakish, pitiable outcasts in a world of triumph, friendship, ease and contentment.</p>
<p>It is this extremely painful impression that deserves to be corrected at once. Failure may seem like the exception when it is being experienced – when we are in a profound crisis – but let there be no misunderstanding: messing up is what humans do and have been doing since the start of our adventure on the planet. Our own, personal failures stand in a prestigious and quasi-essential lineage. We are not alone; we may even be in the majority.</p>
<p>We don’t live through our failures all at once, which is where some of the misapprehension and loneliness comes from, and we don’t necessarily do it visibly, which is another reason why we’re fooled that everyone else is fine, but taken together, humans are both the masters and forced subjects of failure. There is no family in the land without a serious disaster in their midst. Look at a classroom of twenty sweet 5-year-olds; within half a century, a good third of them will have been scarred by a very sharp knife indeed. It would be possible to tell the story of humanity not – as we usually do – as one of progress and gradual mastery, but as one of repeated distress, unshakeable madness and eternal regret. Almost no life goes to plan and few of us come through unscathed – and it’s certainly questionable whether all our beautiful machines and complicated accomplishments have made us one jot less troubled than our animal-skin-clad foraging ancestors.</p>
<p>It’s this sombre reality that can make us feel such a sense of relief when we see a painting such as Pieter Bruegel’s The Triumph of Death (see overleaf). Here is a skeleton army marching over a forlorn landscape, butchering everyone in sight. No one gets away. Kings are breathing their last, lovers are being murdered and funeral pyres are burning in the distance. Corpses are swinging from scaffolds, a horse is dragging a cartload of bodies and massed ranks of soldiers of the armies of death are waiting to join the scene of butchery. This is not a representation of any one particular war zone or scene of horror, but it feels familiar because it is existentially correct, true to some basic facts of our own lives and of all peoples: life is endemically connected with cruelty, ruin and disaster.</p>
<p>This may be a horrific fact to take on board, but it is even more horrific to mistakenly believe that the agony might be ours alone – or that we have been promised anything else. What we are going through only looks rare. Our pain only seems exceptional and aberrant because we are looking at false, wilfully edited – and hence cruelly sentimental – pictures of reality.</p>
<p>Let us consider some of the leading categories of failure that compulsively visit the human animal.</p>
<p>Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Triumph of Death, c. 1562–1563</p>
