        <h4>IV. The Joys of Solitude</h4>
<p>So now it is time to look more closely at the benefits and indeed the ‘bliss’ of solitude. I am going to turn to the positive claims that have been made for being
  alone and see if I can persuade you that they are worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Over the centuries during which people have explicitly practised solitude and reflected on their experience (that is, as long as we have had any form of recorded human culture) there have been
  surprisingly consistent reports of what it might offer those who seek it out. These ‘rewards’ can be grouped into five categories, although they overlap and are certainly not
  exclusive:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A deeper consciousness of oneself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deeper attunement to nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deeper relationship with the transcendent (the numinous, the divine, the spiritual).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased creativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increased sense of freedom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What seems to me most worth noticing is how widespread, through both time and social arrangements, these experiences are. They are not some mad aberrations of a single, or even
  a few, heroic or crazed individuals. Very different people, alone for very different reasons and using very wide-ranging images and languages, all say fundamentally similar things. Going by their
  example, you might try seeking these rewards of solitude yourself.</p>
