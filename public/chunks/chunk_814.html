            <h2>SMALL AND BIG WINS</h2>
<p>Many of the steps we take toward recovery could appear relatively small: a week in which we have not denigrated ourselves, a relationship in which we are allowing ourselves to enjoy kindness, a sequence of peaceful evenings . . . The temptation might be to brush off these achievements a bit too lightly for our own good. Given what we may have gone through, these are milestones that deserve celebration and commemoration, so that we can notice how far we have come and gain strength from a glance back at the peaks and troughs of our mental lives.</p>
<p>We can think in this context of the work of the English walking artist Hamish Fulton. Fulton has spent his long career turning out large black-and-white photographs of places in the world where he has gone walking. Some of these walks have been epic in scale—whole weeks spent trekking across the Himalayas and the Andes; others have been more domestic—a few hours in the Welsh mountains. But Fulton always accompanies his images with solemn text, a written record of where he has been, how many miles he went, and how long it took him. He arrests a moment that might ordinarily be lost and lends it weight and dignity. Through immaculate lettering and sober photography, he is signaling to us how much a walk may—when fairly be viewed—be life-changing and as worthy of commemoration as a battle or a premiership.</p>

<p>We could imagine performing a similar exercise of commemoration on the business of recovering from mental illness. Here, too, there are plenty of moments that are quietly extremely arduous and important—and that would warrant being frozen and highlighted. We could picture a vast photograph of an ordinary bathtub to which a caption might say: “May 12, evening, two hours of soaking, rethinking my relationship to what other people think.” Or a picture of an armchair by a window: “September 3, an hour reflecting on my right to be free and content.” A shot of an unmade bed at night might say: “An evening of self-forgiveness.”</p>
<p>We should be proud of ourselves for making it this far. It might at times have looked as if we would never make it. There might have been nights when we sincerely thought of taking our own lives. Somehow we held on. We reached out for help, we dared to tell someone else of our problems, we engaged our minds, we tried to piece together our histories and to plot a more endurable future—and we started reading about what might be up with our minds. We are still here, mentally ill at times, no doubt, but more than ever committed to recovery, appreciative of the light, grateful for love, hungry for insight, and keen to help anyone else whose plight we can recognize. We are not fully well, but we are on the mend and that, for now, is very much good enough.</p>
<p>Without all those awful things that happened, all those fears, all those people who didn’t understand, what would we have learned? What would we have ever understood? The journey was almost worth it. What looked like a pure waste of time was in fact our own personal education.</p>
