        <h3>¶ Emotional Scepticism</h3>
<p>Emotional Scepticism refers to an attitude of good-natured suspicion towards the majority of our first impulses and feelings. The Emotional Sceptic rarely fully trusts what they immediately desire, what they fear and what their so-called ‘gut’ tells them. They understand their minds to be Faulty Walnuts, highly liable to be throwing off inaccurate or misleading emotions. They like to pause and create a ‘fireguard’ between their feelings and their actions.</p>
<p>Emotional Sceptics will take their time coming to decisions. They sleep on things. They don’t simply act on impulse. They are disinclined to get married after two exceptionally glorious weeks.</p>
<p>Our current culture looks askance at Emotional Scepticism. It sounds very boring, sexless and unimpressive. We are still guided by the Romantic notion that emotions are the voices of our true selves, requiring to be honoured as faithfully and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This background ideology explains why there is still so much folly at large – and why Emotional Scepticism is such a priority.</p>
