        <h2>The Importance of Bad Dates</h2>
<p>While waiting to find our life partner, we may end up going on a number of dates – and we stand to return from many of them in an incensed and depressed mood. Could such people really exist? What is wrong with the human race?</p>
<p>But a bad date doesn’t have to be any sort of conclusive failure; if handled correctly, it may indeed be a crucial educational stage that underpins our chances of subsequent contentment. Apparently dreadful encounters can be among the most helpful experiences we ever pass through because they teach us two ingredients crucial to the maintenance of love: gratitude and realism.</p>
<p>In order to be grateful for the singular individual we end up with, we have to acquire an accurate sense of who and what is typical. If we have no idea how widespread a dry sense of humour is, or an analytical temper, or an empathetic nature, or a very kind heart, we’ll be in no fair position to evaluate any person we eventually land on. We’ll be like a wealthy young heir who has no way of knowing whether flying to Barbados in January is in any way more or less special than dropping in on a five-course meal at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro or having tea with their grandmother in a modest house in the suburbs. Distinctions and virtues will cease to stand out. The muscles of appreciation will atrophy.</p>
<p>But a series of terrible dating encounters firmly educates us in what can generally be expected from the members of our benighted race. It is extremely important to spend a series of evenings in a bar with yet another person who is keen to parade their achievements in order properly to appreciate the rare pleasures of someone with a mature sense of modesty. Several hours with another accomplished professional (with lovely hair and a winning smile) who isn’t very interested in our life might have a lot to teach us about where along the hierarchy of qualities we place intelligently targeted curiosity. It may take several encounters with extreme wealth or beauty to show us what we actually make of these initially extremely enticing-sounding features.</p>
<p>Rather than dismiss bad dates quickly from our minds, as we are prone to do, we should embed them carefully in our memory and even put up a private shrine to them in a diary or on our phone. Every bad date will, in a covert form, contain clues as to the essence of satisfactory love. The one who turned up twenty minutes late without calling will harden our determination to cherish punctuality. The one who used cynicism to defend themselves against their own ambitions can teach us to appreciate an open-hearted sense of purpose. The one who was sexually driven but emotionally detached can serve as a lesson in the need for warmth and sympathy in any bedroom encounter. From the marks of failure we can discern the shape of success.</p>
<p>To sustain us with our partners, we need to keep brightly alive the many differences between them and the mass of humanity, whose nature we will have had a chance to surmise in the slow and troubled years before they appeared. We will know that our partner is not perfect, but – thanks to a litany of bad dates – we will also understand exactly where they slot into the spectrum of compromise, muddle and error. We will – with any luck – know to be very grateful.</p>
<p>By keeping our dating adventures firmly in mind, we are reminding ourselves that plenty of people may look fascinating from the outset but will in fact prove hopeless for us in the long term. Properly digested failure immunises us forever against that particular cancer of relationships: the idea that someone else, somewhere else, would surely be better. The nebulous pull of the alluring stranger can weaken. We will be a little less prone to developing crushes on imaginary figments and a little readier to invest in the all-too-human and well-charted person beside us.</p>
