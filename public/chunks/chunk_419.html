        <h2>What Love Really Is and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>There is so much talk of love in our societies; it would be natural to think that by now we must know what it is and why it counts. Love, we think, is the excited feeling we get in the presence of someone of unusual accomplishment and talent – great intelligence or beauty for the most part – who we hope will reciprocate our interest and whom we badly want to touch, caress and one day share our lives with. This definition sounds so plausible and enjoys such powerful cultural endorsement that we are apt to miss another vision of love altogether – this one focused not so much on an appreciation of strength as on a tolerance of, and kindness towards, what is weak and misshapen.</p>
<p>According to this alternative vision, we display love when, for example, on the way home, we come across an itinerant drunk – weather-beaten and dishevelled, beer-addled and ranting – and do not turn away, but instead take the momentous internal step (with all the eventual outward actions that might follow) of considering them as a version of ourselves, prey to the same passions and distempers, visited by the same longings, upset by similar losses and worthy of their own share of compassion and tolerance.</p>
<p>We show love, too, when we see a well-dressed person shouting imperiously at an airport, filled with self-righteousness, apparently bloated on their own self-regard, and do not dismiss them immediately as insane or entitled, but instead, take the trouble to see the frightened, vulnerable self beneath the bluster. When we grow curious as to the sickness of the soul that might be operating just below the surface and are able to wonder what has hurt them – and why they might be so scared.</p>
<p>It is love that sparks within us when we see a small child throwing themselves on the floor in the aisle of a supermarket, shouting that they want ‘it’ again and again, and do not simply focus on how inconvenient it is to steer our trolley around them and how piercing and maddening their screams are, but also feel how much we understand their frustration – and long to tell them that their pain is, in its general form, our own.</p>
<p>It is also love – the proper and most serious variety in the universe – when our partner is being plainly irrational, unfair, mean-spirited and maddening, and yet we do not, as we so easily might, launch a full dose of righteous anger their way, but instead hold back a little and wonder why this formerly sane and interesting adult should have fallen apart in this manner. When we contemplate the idea that they are not merely awful and vicious, but instead might not have slept very well last night, are perhaps panicked by what the future might bring them or might inside be dealing with feelings of lacerating self-contempt that they hardly understand, let alone know how to master. It is love to go up to them and extend our arms at precisely the juncture when we have so many reasons to slam the door in their face.</p>
<p>However many songs celebrate the act, it is no particular feat to love someone who is on their best behaviour, who looks beautiful and who moves with grace through the world. What really cry out for our attention and our love are rather those people and things that are crooked and gnarled, damaged and self-disgusted. In this definition, love is the effort required to accurately imagine oneself in the life of another human – one who has not made it in any way easy to admire or even like them.</p>
<p>It is love when a novelist spends 300 pages detailing the interior life of a violent criminal and allows us to see the innocent child within the guilty adult. In the Christian tradition, it was the man from Nazareth who gave us the most memorable demonstrations of this sort of love – who made it seem glamorous to love differently from the Romans and the Greeks; to love the prostitute, the prisoner and the sinner, to show love to a wretch and an enemy. To extrapolate from this approach, we might imagine that a truly Christian dating app would not merely highlight the beautiful and the dazzling or allow us to swipe away every slightly displeasing person at a stroke, but would instead stop us arbitrarily at photographs of more challenging figures – those shunned by society, shocking reprobates – and command, with all the authority of divine intonation, ‘Love! Here where it would feel so natural and so easy to hate, your duty is to love …’</p>
<p>That such a command sounds peculiar and laughable is a measure of how we have forgotten this sort of love and how committed we are to love-as-admiration. Yet it is possible to suggest that nothing is more important than this love – that this is the love that rescues nations from intolerance, that pauses wars, that halts recriminations, that calms furies, that prevents murders and that allows civilisation to continue. True love involves precisely not giving someone what is their due but giving them what they need in order to survive instead.</p>
<p>Not least, the spirit of love demands that we acknowledge how much we ourselves may one day stand in need of this form of love-as-forgiveness. We cannot rely on always having justice on our side, in always being able to make a claim on others based on our own unsullied righteousness and goodness. At some point, we may well have to cry for mercy. We may have no leg to stand on. We may have behaved foolishly, and might be in line for severe punishment from a judge who closely follows the letter of the law. At this point, we should hope that there is someone around who still remembers what true love is. Someone who will undertake the heroic effort of not giving us what we deserve, but rather recalling that there must be a sweet and distinctly blameless child beneath the horrible and difficult adult we have become. Someone who can bypass the jeering mob and offer us counsel and reassurance, knowing that every human has a claim upon forgiveness and imagination.</p>
<p>Perhaps, by this example, we will in turn become people who know how to love properly – and after our particular crisis has passed, we may make the effort to extend love to others who have transgressed, so that society can – through this enriching mutuality of imagination – become a less frightening and less harried place for all. A place in which we know to treat one another like naughty children who can be redeemed, rather than felonious wrongdoers who must be loathed into eternity.</p>
