        <h3>Friends</h3>
<p>We cannot afford to keep surrounding ourselves with those witty, popular, sometimes-interesting types whom we nevertheless know – deep down – would run away at the first sign of trouble. We can’t have amusing-but-treacherous friends when our mental well-being is in question. We need allies, however anonymous and outwardly unimpressive they might be, who would offer to spring us out of prison if required. There is no point befriending anyone who cannot understand and tolerate our pain.</p>
