        <h3>¶ Meritocracy</h3>
<p>A meritocracy is a society in which money, jobs and honour are handed out on the basis of talent and merit rather than birth or personal contacts.</p>
<p>The modern world is widely assumed to be moving in an ever more meritocratic direction. It is applauded for doing so, and condemned for not doing so fast enough.</p>
<p>But there is a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: if we truly believe that we have created (or could one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it follows that we have to hold the failures exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable but also deserved.</p>
<p>The question of why, if one is in any way good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.</p>
<p>Meritocracy turns failure from a problem into a catastrophe.</p>
