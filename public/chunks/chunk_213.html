        <h3>Self-assertion</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why our lives are harder than they might be is that most of us do not have a firm handle on the art of mature self-assertion; that is, the ability to put forward our interests in a way that seems credible, dignified, serene and effective. Daily we are confronted by challenges to our positions that require us to find a voice: a partner who subtly denies us affection; a colleague who malignly undermines our proposals; a parent who treads on our aspirations.</p>
<p>In response, we tend to behave in two equally unfortunate ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We say nothing. After all, who are we to speak; why would anyone listen; how dare we? None of which stops us hating and cursing inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We bottle up the toxins until they have built up a head of steam, then let rip a tirade of insults, florid accusations and sulphurous vindictiveness that, at a stroke, destroys the credibility of anything we might be trying to convey and ensures that we can be put in a box labelled ‘tyrannical and unhinged’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first systematic Western explorer of human emotions, suggested that maturity often lies midway between two extremes. His Nicomachean Ethics advances a tripartite table outlining ideal forms of behaviour, along with their two characteristically deficient or excessive departures.</p>
<p>To follow the model in the case of the topic at hand, we might add:</p>
<p>At the root of our failures lies one woefully familiar psychological problem: self-hatred. It is because we haven’t learnt to love and respect ourselves that we say nothing, believing that we have no right to take our own positions seriously. Associated with this is despair at the possibility of any form of advanced intrahuman understanding. We have no experience of dialogue working out, of someone clearing their throat, apologising for being a nuisance and then calmly and eloquently articulating a point, only for their interlocutor to concede, to thank them for speaking up and to promise to look at things differently in the future. Our inner world is instead populated by shadow images of powerful tyrants who don’t listen, and meek serfs with no fair right to exist. Or else, from an associated form of self-suspicion, we rush our lesson and, by making a doomed assault on the integrity of our opponent, essentially prove to ourselves that we knew it would never work out.</p>
<p>It can be exhausting constantly to assert oneself. In the course of a typical day, we will face many moments in which we should speak up properly: politely yet firmly, determinedly yet respectfully. It might have helped if we had received early training, as in one of those childhoods read about in psychology manuals, where a parent gently asks the upset three-year-old: ‘Darling, how do you feel about that?’ and listens to the answer, rather than telling the child to stop being so silly or attacking them for being inconsiderate after a hard day at the office.</p>
<p>We should see the challenge of mastering assertion as one of the great psychological hurdles. To learn how to assert oneself steadily and graciously might be ranked as a feat no less worthy of celebration (and much more useful) than climbing a mountain or making a fortune.</p>
<p>We should assert ourselves not because it will always work. Indeed, a bit of pessimism can be handy; when we know that people might not understand us, we no longer feel so desperate that they must. We should assert ourselves irrespective of results because it will lend us an important sense of our own agency and strength – and we’ll twitch less.</p>
<p>To get us going, right now, we might consider where we are being gently but punishingly trodden on by those around us: people who conveniently and cleverly tell us that it’s all our fault, or expect us to do the heavy lifting, or rely on us to smile and put up with their ill temper. Unusually for us, we might properly take on board that life won’t go on forever, that we have a right to be here and that there is a small but fair chance of being understood.</p>
<p>For once, rather than saying nothing or shouting, we might wait until we are rested and feeling kind to ourselves and take up a piece of very unfamiliar Aristotelian middle ground, patiently uttering some magical words: I’d love it if we might have a quick chat at some point, whenever it’s convenient. There’s something it would feel great to discuss …</p>
