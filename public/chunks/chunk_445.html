        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>At one time, we might have had plans for happiness on an epic scale: we might have wanted to be happy ‘forever’. Now we are satisfied if no further disaster strikes us before nightfall. We might once have sought out ever-increasing fame and power. Now we have been inducted into how quickly things can fall apart and won’t take a quiet day for granted ever again. As newly failed beings, we may turn into people with an acute eye for small pleasures: a lemon on a windowsill, some clouds silhouetted by the evening sun, a fig, a piece of chocolate, a hot bath, a chat with a funny friend. The horizon shrinks: one comfortable lunch is something to celebrate. An afternoon in which we have not been visited by searing regrets is a triumph. It’s a massive achievement not to think of killing oneself for an entire weekend. We take it a day at a time.</p>
