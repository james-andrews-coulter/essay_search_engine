        <h2>Travel &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Few moments in our lives are as melancholy as those in which we go travelling somewhere on our own. Imagine that it’s late in the evening at a large airport somewhere in modernity. Most of the terminal is now empty; the few remaining departures are all for other continents. Most of us will be spending the night over an ocean turned silver by a brilliant moon. The waiting travellers are spread out across the terminal. Some are sleeping, most are checking messages, a few are looking pensively into the middle distance. Outside, maintenance crews are loading bags and fitting fuel hoses. Stacks of meals are being craned into galleys. Occasionally, a metallic voice reminds us to stay close to our luggage or announces that a plane is ready to board: Osaka, San Francisco, Beijing, Dubai. So many unforeseen, unknown places. The world is still, in its way, so large and unknown.</p>
<p>Through the plate glass windows, a roar of engines can be heard. Another giant ascends to the skies. Soon it will be our turn. Everyone here is a pilgrim, everyone seems lost – and this may offer us more of a sense of being understood than an environment that speaks in sentimental tones of settled community and family harmony. We are all misfit nomads here. No one belongs and therefore everyone can belong. We, who permanently feel like outsiders, may be nowhere more at home than in the lonely drift of a brightly lit airport at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>There can be a similar pleasing melancholy in a hotel room in a city where we know no one. For a whole evening, we may be on our own with the television, room service and a view onto 300 other similar windows across a courtyard. Our thoughts can feel newly expansive and free, released from the normal demands of home and its pressures to be coherent and predictable, knowable and tame. The unfamiliar furniture, the foreign soap operas on TV and the sounds of the city beyond release us to explore ideas we had resisted. From our bed, we can see a person in another room reading; above them, a couple appear to be arguing; in a third, a child is showing their teddy the view. We feel a rush of love for these people we will never meet, but with whom we are briefly sharing a slice of existence in a frightening anonymous concrete block on the edge of an ugly, wealthy city in a country we have no energy to understand. How much we might like to open up to them; how much secret sorrow and regret there will be; how worthy we all are of forgiveness and tenderness.</p>
<p>In anonymous places – airports, hotels, diners, train stations – we have an opportunity to meet disavowed sides of our characters: sadness, regret and loss. The bleakness all around is a relief from the false comforts of home. We don’t have to pretend any longer. The environment supports us in our wish to own up to a sadness we may have hidden from for too long.</p>
<p>The fellow outsiders we encounter in these lonely places seem closer to offering us the true community we crave than the friends we should supposedly rely on.</p>
<p>There can be something almost beautiful about the ugliest kinds of travelling place: plasticised, brightly lit, garish, cheap. The lack of domesticity, the pitiless illumination and the anonymous furniture offer an alternative to the covert cruelty of ordinary good taste. It may be easier to give way to sadness here than in a cosy living room with wallpaper and framed photos.</p>
<p>We may feel most at home where there is no option to belong.</p>
