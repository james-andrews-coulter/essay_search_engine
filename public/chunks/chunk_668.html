        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>At points, in despair at yet more agonising uncertainty about whether it would be best to stay in or to leave a relationship, we might find ourselves harbouring a curious longing: that the relationship could be even worse than it is. If, for example, our partner had done something obviously and egregiously appalling, if they were cataclysmically unpleasant and we were unable to stand a single minute more in their presence – in short, if we despised them and they us – it would at least be clear what we should do next.</p>
<p>But our situation is typically complicated by a strange set of facts: that we continue to like our partner at times; that we laugh together, that we maintain respect, that they looked very charming the other night, that we think them impressive in company and that they’re superior to ninetynine percent of the people who cross our path day to day. Maddeningly, try as we might, we can’t hate them.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can’t rest easy with them either. Whenever we start to relax into the relationship, whenever we finally believe that this could, after all, be the future till the end, something happens to remind us that it can’t go on, that this is a fundamentally hopeless situation, that we have to get out while there is still time, that we can’t continue to overlook what is wrong between us. It might be the physical relationship or the lack of emotional connection, their refusal to tackle certain inner issues, a maddening argumentativeness or an absence of warmth or joy. Whatever it may be, the reality is that this is a dysfunctional relationship; we only need to see a properly happy couple to be reminded of all that is humiliatingly amiss.</p>
<p>Stay-or-leave is a lonely place. Society has a lot of patience for people who have been left, and a decent amount of prurient interest in those who are hooking up, but this zone of confusion and ambivalence can feel at once distasteful and tedious. To most of the world, we simply have to put up a brave front and shut up; they largely have no clue how much we ruminate and what pain we’re in. We pull a wan smile when they compliment us on our partner and say how happy we look together at the moment (the verdict normally comes just after a particularly grave crisis). It’s exhausting to have to pretend to this extent. It may be 3 a.m. before we can look the choice in the eye and feel its full horror staring back.</p>
<p>There may be very few people to whom we can turn. Trusted confidants can be surprisingly thin on the ground; friends may try to hurry us out of the relationship or keep us unnaturally fixed. Behind their advice, we sense their own agendas and experiences muddying the waters.</p>
<p>This book is an attempt to help us out of our inertia. We may be seeking permission to do something we’ve been longing to do for a while, and hope that a book might provide us with legitimacy. But there may also be cases where the idea of leaving, clearly delineated, provokes disagreement and a fresh appetite for hope and commitment. The best way for us to discover our own taste may be to see what we agree with here and what might provoke spontaneous cries of protest.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we may decide that we do want to stay. Or we may discover that we must have a conversation to end matters in the coming days. Whichever way it goes, what we can hope for above all is resolution. We cannot continue in painful ambivalence indefinitely: we need either to recommit to love (in some form or other) or to abandon it with kindness. At best, either we will stay and now have some firm reasons for doing so, or we will leave, but with a minimum of doubt and a cap on our regrets.</p>
<p>This book is a tool that carries the promise of the clearer and less compromised future we deserve.</p>
