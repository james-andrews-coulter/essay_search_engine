        <h2>‘You’ve made unforgivable mistakes’</h2>
<p>That one again. There’s no point denying it. The best defence is retreat: of course! Of course you’ve made some terrible and even some catastrophic mistakes! Of course you’ve been an idiot! But can you take a moment to remember your childhood, to summon up what you went through, the background you came from? What chance did you have of being even partially sane? It’s amazing you’re able to stand up and say your own name. We don’t do perfect people around here. This is a clinic for the broken. Stop torturing yourself with an idea that you might ever have been perfect; be amazed you exist.</p>
