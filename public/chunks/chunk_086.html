            <h3>¶ Jolliness</h3>
<p>Jolliness might sound like an ideal state of mind. However, with its remorseless and insistent upbeat quality, it has little in common with what is really required for a well-lived life.</p>
<p>Normality includes a lot of sorrows. Many genuinely sad things occur in every existence, pretty much every day. In the background of most of our lives, there is likely to be a powerful sadness. It’s natural to want to skirt contact with it, but such avoidance comes at a high price. Honesty about the darkness inside ourselves and the strangeness and cruelty of life more generally are crucial components in engaging with our own ambitions and achieving intimacy with others.</p>
<p>In a discussion of parenting styles, the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott once identified a particularly problematic kind of child carer: the person who wants to ‘jolly’ babies and small children along, always picking them up with cheer, bouncing them up and down and pulling exaggerated funny faces, perhaps shouting ‘peekaboo’ repeatedly. The criticism might feel disconcerting: what could be so wrong with wanting to keep a child jolly? Yet Winnicott was worried by what effect this would have on a child – the way it was subtly not giving the child a chance to acknowledge its own sadness, or more broadly, its own feelings.</p>
<p>The jollier doesn’t just want the child to be happy; more alarmingly, it can’t tolerate the idea that it might be sad, so unexplored and potentially overwhelming are his or her own background feelings of disappointment and grief.</p>
<p>Childhood is necessarily full of sadness (as is adulthood), insisted Winnicott, and we must perpetually be granted the possibility of periods of mourning: for a broken toy, the grey sky on a Sunday afternoon, or the lingering sadness we can see in our parents’ eyes.</p>
<p>We need a public culture that remembers how much of life deserves to have solemn and mournful moments and that isn’t tempted – normally in the name of selling us things – aggressively to deny the legitimate place of melancholy.</p>
