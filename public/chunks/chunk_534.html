        <h3>2. Other People</h3>
<p>Having to live around other people can severely challenge any desire to remain calm, kind and good. The School of Life takes seriously the ambition of being polite and nice, despite the lack of prestige that surrounds these concepts and the constant frictions and misunderstandings that attend communal life.</p>
<p>At The School of Life, we also know that kindness is a skill that has to be learnt – and that we must put unexpectedly intense energy into the task of overcoming our first responses to other people, which often veer (quite understandably) towards rage, paranoia and defensiveness.</p>
<p>Two manoeuvres stand out. We must expect less of people – not in order to do an injustice to them, but so as to be readier to forgive and accept problems when they arise. And we must learn to see that bad behaviour almost always stems not from evil but from pain and anxiety. We need to direct sympathy and imagination towards a very unfamiliar target: those who frustrate us most.</p>
