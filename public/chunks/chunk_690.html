            <h3>¶ Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>Teaching and learning are the two central emotional skills we need for life among other humans. Considered properly, teaching – by which we mean the business of getting an important idea from one mind into another – is vital in any couple, office or family we’ll ever belong to. Every one of us, whatever our occupation, needs to become a good teacher, for our lives constantly require us to deliver crucial information with grace and effectiveness into the deep minds of others. Furthermore, we also need the humility required by the student role: we need to recall how little we know; we need to acknowledge how generally unpleasant it is to have to take anything new on board; and we need to admit how tempting it is to blame the teacher rather than confront their message.</p>
<p>Most of us probably started off by being quite bad teachers, with tendencies to get annoyed by the fact that another person doesn’t know something yet – even though we have never told them what it might be. Certain ideas can seem so important to us, we can’t imagine that others don’t already know them. We suspect they may be deliberately upsetting us by pretending not to have a clue. This attitude makes it unlikely that what we actually have to teach will make its way successfully into the other person’s head. Good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance is not a defect of the individual we’re instructing; it’s the consequence of never having been properly taught. The fault only ever belongs with the people who haven’t done enough to get the needed ideas into others’ heads – in other words, with you.</p>
<p>The more we need other people to know something, the less we may be able to secure the calm frame of mind that is indispensable if we are to have a chance of conveying it to them effectively. The possibility that they won’t quickly understand a point that matters immensely to us can drive us into an agitated fury – the very worst state in which to conduct any lesson. By the time we’ve started to insult our so-called pupil, to shout, call them a blockhead or a fool, the lesson is plainly over. No one has ever learnt anything under conditions of humiliation. Paradoxically, the best sort of teachers can bear the possibility that what they have to teach will not be understood. It is this slightly detached, slightly pessimistic approach that stands the best chance of generating the relaxed frame of mind essential to successful pedagogy.</p>
<p>Good teachers are also good students. They know that everyone has a lot to learn and everyone has something important to impart to others. We should never become incensed if someone is trying to teach us something. We should never want to be liked just as we are. Only a perfect being would be committed to their own status quo. For the rest of us, good learning and teaching are the only ways to ensure we have a chance of developing into slightly better versions of ourselves.</p>
