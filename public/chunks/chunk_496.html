        <h2>Small Pleasures</h2>
<p>Small pleasures – which comprise such elements as a good night of sleep, a slice of fresh bread or a conversation with a close friend – lack prestige or social support. Our age believes in big pleasures. We have inherited a Romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find, exotic, or unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. We subtly like high prices. If something is cheap or free, it’s a little harder to appreciate. We are mostly focused on large schemes that we hope will deliver substantial enjoyment: marriage, career, travel and the purchase of a house.</p>
<p>The approach isn’t wholly wrong, but it unwittingly exhibits a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary, the familiar and the small-scale.</p>
<p>The paradoxical aspect of pleasure is how promiscuous it proves to be. It doesn’t neatly collect in the most expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us on grand holidays. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods.</p>
<p>A pleasure may look very minor – eating a fig, whispering in bed in the dark, talking to a grandparent, or scanning through old photos – and yet be anything but. If properly grasped and elaborated upon, these sorts of activities may be among the most moving and satisfying we can have.</p>
<p>Appreciating what is to hand isn’t a defence of failure; it isn’t an attack on ambition. But there is no point in chasing the future until and unless we are attuned to the modest moments and things that are available to us already.</p>
<p>The smallness of a pleasure isn’t really an assessment of how much it has to offer us: it is a reflection of how many good things the world unfairly neglects. A small pleasure is a great pleasure in waiting; it is a true source of joy that has not yet received the collective acknowledgement it is due.</p>
