        <h2>UNCONDITIONAL APPROVAL</h2>
<p>What frequently assails and derails us when we are sick in our minds is a continuous punishing sense of how terrible we are. We are lacerated by self-hatred. Without any external prompting, we think of ourselves as some of the worst people around, even the worst person on earth. Our own charge sheet against us is definitive: we are “awful,” “terrible,” “nasty,” “bad.” We can’t really say much more—and efforts to get us to expand in rational terms may run aground. We often can’t even point to a specific crime, or if we do it doesn’t seem to onlookers to merit quite the pitiless opprobrium we devote to it. In our illness, a primal self-suspicion bursts through our defenses and overtakes our faculties, leaving no room for the slightest gentleness. We are implacably appalled by, and unforgiving of, who we are.</p>
<p>In such agony, a loving companion can make the difference between suicide and keeping going. Such companions do not try to persuade us of our worth with cold reason; nor do they need to go in for any showy displays of affection. They can just demonstrate that we matter to them in a thousand surreptitious yet fundamental ways. They keep showing up by our bed day after day, they make pleasant conversation about something that won’t in any way make us anxious, they’ve remembered a favorite blanket or a drink, they know how to make a few jokes when these help, and they suggest a nap when they feel us drifting away. They have a good sense of the sources of our pain, but they aren’t pushing us for a big conversation or confession. They can tolerate how ill we are and will stick by us however long it takes. We don’t have to impress them and they won’t worry too much about how scary we are looking or the weird things we might say. They’re not going to give up on us. The disease might take a month or six years or sixty, but they’re going nowhere. We can call them at strange hours. We can sob or we can sound very adult and reasonable. They seem, remarkably, to love us in and of ourselves, for who we are rather than anything we do. They hold a loving mirror to us and help us to tolerate the reflection. It’s pretty much the most beautiful and useful thing in the universe.</p>
