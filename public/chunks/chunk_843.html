        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A melancholy paradox lies at the heart of modern relationships: practically everyone on Earth longs to be loved and to love within stable, long-term, flourishing couples, but, on the ground, contented unions are dauntingly rare. We have ourselves probably been looking for rewarding love for a long time already; we may have been on a succession of awkward dates and met a number of people who seemed delightful at first; we may have lived with someone for a while; we might even have been married. But, of course, nothing has worked out. That is why we are here. The questions go on.</p>
<p>What we can be sure of from the outset is that, whatever society sometimes implies, the problem does not lie with us alone. We need not compound our misery by thinking it unique. If we were magically given wings, we might skim over any large modern city and look down at a range of newly formed couples: one pair might be holding hands in a fashionable bar, another would be lazing together in bed, a third would be flirting at work – all would be feeling excited and blessed. But we would need only skip forward a few years for the overall picture to grow darker.</p>
<p>The majority of couples would have separated (some would have forgotten each other’s names). Only a small number would have married and, of these, a fair few would have divorced in acrimony. Some would be sticking together mainly for the sake of a child or because they could not afford to split. Only a tiny number would be beaming at us and confiding that their wishes had largely been honoured. The world encourages us to place our faith in a kind of love that, on the basis of the predominant evidence, seems barely to exist.</p>
<p>Are we being tricked? Why do so few couples succeed? It is tempting to believe that those who work out have been granted a form of divine favour. But we cannot build a decent life on the hope of randomly distributed heavenly munificence. Is there anything we can do in our search for sound intimate lives other than offer libations to the gods?</p>
<p>The premise of the argument here is that there is no need for superstition or despair. Good relationships are neither mysterious nor random. There are solid, rationally structured explanations for why some people do well together while others – despite powerful initial hopes and touchingly idealistic intentions – do not. Success only seems random because we have, to date, operated with an insufficiently firm grip on the actual mechanics of true love.</p>
<p>There are, in reality, only a small number of fundamental factors that account for the well-being of every robust, loving couple. Though relationships might seem infinitely varied, whether they succeed or fail comes down, in essence, to the presence – or absence – of a handful of emotional skills. Stated briefly, the five anchors of successful relationships are:</p>
<p>i.     A mutual, nondefensive readiness to admit to imperfections.</p>
<p>ii.    A willingness to let ourselves be vulnerable.</p>
<p>iii.  A generous, compassionate response to our flaws and errors.</p>
<p>iv.   A therapeutic reaction to what is ‘mad’ inside both of us.</p>
<p>v.    A sufficient lack of anger to keep admiration alive.</p>
<p>The list may sound simple. As we will see, enacting it is the work of a lifetime. Nevertheless, if these psychological ingredients are reliably – and mutually – in place, then the normal trials and stresses of coupledom can be both faced and survived, just as if these qualities are absent, no other advantage will ever manage to fend off eventual collapse.</p>
<p>It is striking how different these anchors of love are to the qualities we’re typically encouraged to trust in when considering the sources of romantic happiness. There is no reference here to looks, money, shared hobbies, a similar taste in films or, indeed, ‘chemistry’. It is not that any of these factors (routinely cited in wedding speeches) are undesirable. They are plainly extremely helpful and at certain points compelling; they are just never decisive. That two people have good careers, both like rollerblading and once felt delighted to be together as an August sun went down over the terracotta roofs of a Mediterranean coastal town ultimately tells us very little about their chances of enduring together the unavoidable maelstroms of existence.</p>
<p>The real issue is how two individuals who are necessarily radically imperfect at their core might stay united – and thrive – without giving way to fury, boredom, despair or bitterness. And it’s to this question that our five emotional anchors offer solutions. They present us with the psychological wherewithal for dealing with what is most knotty and gnarled in ourselves and our partners, and for navigating the frustrations and incompatibilities that no wedding speech will ever allude to but that will in time eat away at our sweetest hopes and most sincere plans.</p>
<p>Ultimately every relationship is a meeting between two shockingly complicated people and their tortuous and only half-understood histories. The qualities that help us in this encounter are those that enable us to fathom, withstand, forgive, harmonise and laugh over our differences. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it should never be a precondition.</p>
<p>Though we may look at the list of emotional qualities and feel initially dismayed at all that we lack, we can be assured that emotional maturation is possible. Love is – in the end – a skill, not an emotion. Successful relationships are a special kind of achievement. Their inner workings are comprehensible and attainable. We don’t have to be locked into a cycle of enthusiasm followed by sadness. With the appropriate prompts and careful assistance, we can take the first steps towards the kind of fulfilling, long-term union that we have for so long aspired to and deserve. We can – though our culture makes the idea sound unfairly strange – learn to love.</p>
