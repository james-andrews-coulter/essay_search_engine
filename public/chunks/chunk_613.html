        <h2>REASSURANCE</h2>
<p>The future for a mentally ill person is a source of ongoing and limitless torment. A thousand questions hover: What if someone gets very angry with them? What if someone wants to take them away? What if someone tries to kill them? What if the voices in their head never go away?</p>
<p>The loving companion does their best to quieten the panic by presenting the future as unknowable in its precise details but fundamentally safe and bearable. They hold open options: it will always be possible to leave town, to live very quietly in a small cottage, to be at home and lead a domestic existence. No one expects them to perform great feats any more, just being is enough. There doesn’t have to be pressure to earn money, to impress strangers, or to be heroic. Surviving is all that matters.</p>
<p>More importantly, the loving companion insists that they will be there to personally ensure that the future is manageable. When things get terrible, they can be in each other’s presence and hold each other’s spirits.</p>
<p>The loving companion doesn’t get bored of instilling the same fundamental message: I am here for you and it will be OK. Even if this OK isn’t what one would ideally want, still it will be all right, it will be better than death—which probably remains the alternative in the sufferer’s mind. Quite how the years ahead are going to pan out can’t be determined yet, details will have to be examined later, but what is known already now is that the future won’t need to be unendurable, for a huge basic reason: because there is love.</p>
<p>PATIENCE</p>
<p>We are, when mentally ill, often extremely tedious in relation to the number of anxieties we desperately need to go through with others. We may want to return again and again to the subject of whether or not we said something terrible to someone at a party hosted by our workplace seven years ago. Or whether we might have unwittingly upset a sexual companion five years before. Or if we might go bankrupt because we didn’t warn our accountant of a small move in our tax affairs.</p>
<p>Loving parents know that the minds of little children are similarly filled with anxiety-inducing and sometimes peculiar questions: Is there a tiger under the bed? What happens if one of the trees comes into the room and takes me away? What if someone laughs at me at school?</p>
<p>The temptation can be to rush in and give an answer full of blustering, impatient confidence. Of course it will be fine! Nonsense, there’s no tiger! And so on. But the properly loving response is to take the worry as seriously as its progenitor does and address it head on, without scoffing or denying the scale of the concern. We might get out a pad of paper and a pen and run through all the many anxieties. It doesn’t matter if this is the first or the fifteenth time we have done so. Love gives us the patience to enter imaginatively into the other’s worried mind and to try to settle it by sensible examination of what there might be to fear.</p>
<p>We may be called upon to inspect for imaginary tigers night after night and, on the floor with a torch, should always be ready to go through the many reasons why these big cats have—after all—decided to leave us in peace.</p>
