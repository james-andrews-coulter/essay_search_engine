        <h3>¶ Good Business</h3>
<p>Good Business is a form of economic activity that has two ends in view: to make money and to satisfy the higher needs of humankind.</p>
<p>This dual target makes good business doubly hard to succeed at. Most organisations have only one goal in view: they either try to make money without regard for higher needs, or they target higher needs without regard for money.</p>
<p>Both of these choices come at a great cost: either profit becomes dissociated from true human value, or the beneficial influence of an organisation is undermined by its financial weakness.</p>
<p>The future of business lies in learning to make profits from our higher rather than our lower needs.</p>
<p>In the Utopia, business would have the same moral cachet that today attaches to charity, and for the same reason: its core efforts would be directed to improving the lives of others.</p>
