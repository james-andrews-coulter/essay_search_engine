            <h3>¶ Good Brands</h3>
<p>The word ‘brand’ brings with it disturbing associations: heartless commercialism, crushing uniformity, blandness, a dumbed-down experience. A brand can be seen as a cynical way of cashing in on what might once have been a good idea by stripping away whatever was originally quirky, authentic and brave and churning out a standardised product. It is the corporate antithesis of art. When anyone sells out, it’s a brand that buys their soul.</p>
<p>There are plenty of bad brands around, so it’s understandable that blame gets attached to the underlying notion of the brand itself. It becomes tempting to suppose that, ideally, we would live in an unbranded world. In fact, the idea of a brand is a really significant one. A good economy needs good brands.</p>
<p>Essentially, a brand is a constellation of qualities; it is a personality in the material realm. It presents a vision of life in a hugely condensed manner. But a brand doesn’t only symbolise a set of ideas. It makes these ideas reproducible and universal. Brands allow particular qualities to multiply across the world. We tend to be alive to the negative possibilities, but the true culprit is never the pure idea of repetition. What we tend really to be objecting to is what is being repeated.</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the Italian architect Andrea Palladio worked out some basic designs for villas, churches and public buildings in the Classical style. He built the first version in the little town of Vicenza. But his ideas spread; they were branded and universalised. Over the centuries, they were taken up in France, the UK, Poland, Russia and especially in the US. Thomas Jefferson in particular bought into the Palladian brand: his own house, Monticello, and the University of Virginia are key examples of franchise architecture, just as much as is the design for a McDonald’s restaurant. The key issue isn’t free creativity versus the cold hand of the brand. Rather, it’s between the good, noble brand (like Palladio) and the less impressive versions that tend to be much more familiar.</p>
<p>Brands invite the recognition that great things are rarely done by individuals acting in heroic isolation. At some point, every good idea, every important insight should go through the process of becoming a brand, so as to widen its power. The world is in great need of better brands.</p>
