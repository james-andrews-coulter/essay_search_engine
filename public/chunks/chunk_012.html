        <h3>8. The old friendship</h3>
<p>A quarter of a century ago, Xavier and Khendra were assigned to the same halls of residence in Edinburgh; they were close friends for four years, then life took them quite separate ways. Xavier lived in London for some years; Khendra worked in many countries before making Los Angeles her home. More recently they are both back living in Scotland, though on different sides of the country; their lives are very different. Khendra, who is single, is a political advisor in the Scottish Parliament; Xavier runs a chain of wholefood shops and has recently started a family with his husband, James.</p>
<p>They still very much like to get together occasionally to reminisce.</p>
<p>Psychologically speaking, ageing is a deeply ambiguous process. We almost certainly become more competent, and we like to think we become wiser. But there is also what might be called the wisdom of youth that we stand to forget, which is why reminiscing – which can sometimes sound mawkish and delusional – deserves a philosophical rethink.</p>
<p>Consider the fate of probably the most prosperous artist of the 19th century, Sir John Everett Millais. In his later life he made a huge fortune; his single most commercially successful work was a painting called Bubbles. It shows a curly-haired little boy (in fact, his grandson) blowing soap bubbles; it’s technically very skilful, but no one can claim it’s addressing anything much. It was, however, massively taken up by the large and ambitious Pears soap company as the centre of an advertising campaign. It became perhaps the best-known contemporary image in the Western world.</p>

<p>The problem came when, in a gesture of homage, Millais’ fellow artists put up an exhibition of his early work, the best of which he hadn’t seen for many years. The elderly Millais – rich, celebrated and knighted – was confronted by who he had been as an artist: less polished, more urgent, caring nothing for popularity yet eager to ennoble the public. Over the years, his early insights and aspirations had been submerged in the alluring worldliness of celebrity. His style had become smoother, but his aim was less true. He wept, it is said, in shame. Millais, we may say, had not reminisced enough. And he had, we know historically, largely broken with his old friends. He’d lost touch with what was wonderful about who he used to be.</p>
<p>Xavier and Khendra aren’t artists, but together they are keeping the wisdom of their youth alive as they age. For this it’s not suﬃcient merely to retell externals: the way it used to be possible to rent a student flat in the Royal Circus – now a plutocratic abode; the curious fact that there used to be more direct flights between Edinburgh and Venice, not that that particularly mattered to them then. What they do instead is push each other for psychological detail.</p>
<p>… Remember how you got really interested in writing poetry, and used to put quotes from who-was-it up in the kitchen? Why was that so nice? What might it have become? What would be the version of that today?</p>
<p>… How did you feel about your parents then? I sort of forget, but I don’t recall you talking much about them. How has your perspective on them changed?</p>
<p>… You were so unsure about what to do. Didn’t you apply to work in a bank and have ideas about living in a croft? What was going on? Can you still feel in touch with the confused parts of yourself?</p>
<p>… Why was it that we were thrilled to be sleeping in a flea-pit hotel in Paris? (Remember the bathroom with the door that wouldn’t close?) Why can’t we be excited that way now, instead of so concerned about upgrades and toiletries?</p>
<p>… When we cleaned up after that party (the one where Imran wore that jacket) with ABBA belting out – why was tidying up such fun?</p>
<p>It’s not that our younger selves were perfect. But in the experiences we had then, we can find so much that is nice, complicated and interesting about our own nature – some of which may not be nearly so much in evidence today. These aspects of who we are have been pushed aside by the demands of later life, but they stand – always – to be rediscovered and reanimated. We need the old friend who was with us then and knew and shared the truths that once were more visible.</p>
<p>An old friendship meets our need to keep alive the best of who we used to be.</p>
