<li>Fear of Ageing</li>

<p>‘There’s nothing tragic about being 50. Not unless you’re trying to be 25’</p>
<p>– Sunset Boulevard, 1950</p>
<p>In 2013 a 42-year-old American actress sued a Web site for revealing her age. ‘If one is perceived to be “over the hill”, i.e. approaching 40, it is nearly impossible for an up-and-coming actress … to get work’, read her lawsuit, ‘as she is thought to have less of an “upside”.’</p>
<p>Two years earlier a Californian woman admitted that, to help her 8-year-old daughter – a beauty-pageant contestant – get rid of the ‘wrinkles’ that appeared on the girl’s face when she smiled, she injected her with Botox. Said her daughter, ‘I check every night for wrinkles; when I see some I want more injections. They used to hurt, but now I don’t cry that much.’ Ignominy rained down on her mother – it’s so comforting to find someone we can all agree to hate. But she’d only pushed a cultural trend to its extreme. When is it acceptable to start Botoxing yourself or your children? Just-past-teens is now apparently a perfectly unremarkable age to start worrying about looking older.</p>
