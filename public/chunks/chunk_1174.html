        <h2>4. Between the Ages</h2>
<p>When caricatures of old people seem not just tenacious but also inevitable – this is when we need to turn to history. But if we don’t idealize the past, are we really going to feel happier about growing older by learning that the ancient Sardinians hurled their elders off high cliffs, and roared with laughter when they fell onto the rocks below? Or that in remote parts of Japan adults used to eat old men once they’d reached a certain age? Perhaps the point of such grisly accounts is to make us appreciate that, with our heating allowance and free NHS prescriptions to look forward to (always assuming these survive), ours is going to be a pampered ageing, so we should shut up and quit complaining.</p>
<p>No: what history shows us is that attitudes towards old people can and have changed – even if not invariably for the better; there’s nothing immutable or ‘natural’ about them. The more we learn about the historical origins of ageism, the easier it is not to take it personally.</p>
<p>As Simone de Beauvoir pointed out, ‘a man’s [sic] ageing and his decline always takes place inside some given society.’ Looking back and elsewhere reveals how much our opinions and behaviour are shaped by the societies we live in and, even more, by their economies: what ends with a casual expression of ageism – ‘he’s showing his age’ – begins with economic anxieties. Understand this and you have a whole trunk of tools to help combat ageism.</p>
<p>No golden age</p>
<p>Certainly gerontophobia has a long history. Aristotle called old people small-minded, malicious and ungenerous. Plautus practically invented the stereotype of the dirty but impotent old man. Senecide – the killing of old people – was common practise in many cultures. The Hopi abandoned their old in specially built huts. The Samoans buried their elders alive, while the Nambikwara Indians have one word meaning young and beautiful, and another for both old and ugly.</p>
<p>In most traditional societies you were shown respect only as long as you were socially useful. There were practical reasons for this: as the historian David Hackett Fischer pointed out, in groups living close to the edge of subsistence, dependent old people were a heavy burden on their kin. Indeed senecide often exists side by side with infanticide.</p>
<p>Old and powerful</p>
<p>Preindustrial societies certainly weren’t all gerontocracies, where old people ruled. Still, old age, when it was much rarer than now, had a scarcity value and was a far more venerated state: age often conferred prestige and privileges, power and authority. In ancient Greece you couldn’t become a member of the jury until 50. The Roman Senate originated from the word senex, meaning aged. Between 1400 and 1600, the average age of the doges, who held the highest office in the Venetian republic, was 72.</p>
<p>Although early modern Europeans searched obsessively for the Fountain of Youth, the idea that older meant worse was foreign. In the seventeenth century men wore wigs powdered white because they wanted to look old. In eighteenth-century New England, people tried to make themselves seem older than they actually were by adding years to their real age, rather than subtracting them.</p>
<p>The big shift</p>
<p>But the nineteenth century saw the start of a profound change in the way old age was thought about: the idea that ageing was part of the human condition, with its inevitable limits, increasingly gave way to a conception of old age as a biomedical problem to which there might be a scientific solution.</p>
<p>This was reflected in changes to both customs and language. In seventeenth-century America the best seats in meeting houses were reserved for old people. Between 1770 and 1840 they lost those privileged seats, yielding them to the wealthy, and new laws forced them to retire at a fixed age. Before 1780 ‘fogey’ meant a wounded military veteran; by 1830 it had acquired the meaning it has today – a pejorative term for an old, hidebound person. Similarly ‘senile’ was transformed in the nineteenth century from a value-free adjective signifying old age to a medical term conveying the debilitations of old age, most often paired with ‘dementia’. ‘Codger’, ‘superannuated’ and eventually ‘geriatric’ joined them in the lexicon of contempt for the old.</p>
<p>Before 1780 ‘fogey’ meant a wounded military veteran.</p>
<p>However, most words that describe older women never had such salad days: ‘hag’ and ‘crone’, like almost every term of abuse combining old with female, have a long history. ‘Old maid’, even in the sixteenth century, was disparaging, while ‘witch’ invariably attributed a dangerous power to older women. ‘Spinster’ is the exception. Originally it meant a woman who spun wool, a rare occupation open to women, which enabled them to make a living independent of a man. Today, though, it’s a derogatory term, used to refer to all older, single women, and which implies that they haven’t been able to find a husband rather than chosen not to marry.</p>
<p>It’s easy to overstate this change – in reality, attitudes to older people have always varied enormously, and so have their experiences. And of course definitions of age change over time. When the average lifespan in the middle ages was vastly shorter than today, it’s hardly surprising that to the poet Dante old age began at 46.</p>
<p>Yet in the nineteenth century ‘the aged’ came to be seen as a distinct social group, segregated from the rest of society. You were now less likely to become a pauper as you aged, but at the same time you were less likely to be respected. Before the big shift, older people were seen as playing a vital social role. After it, although their medical and economic conditions improved, their social importance declined.</p>
<p>Thomas Cole, another historian of old age, has argued that by the late nineteenth century, middle-class Protestantism – the dominant culture – had lost the ability to face ageing with ‘existential integrity’, replacing it instead with fear, evasion and hostility towards old people.</p>
<p>The emerging idea that humans were perfectible brought with it a belief that the precariousness of life could be eradicated, and that human limits need no longer apply. Old age became a disease, a pathology demanding special professional expertise, if not custodial care. What got lost, Cole suggests, was any framework that made sense – morally, spiritually or metaphysically – of growing old. Ageing needed to be ‘managed’, and was split between ‘good’ ageing and ‘bad’. Cole has talked of the ‘demeaning of later life.’ Interestingly it was just at this point in the nineteenth century, when old age was coming to be devalued, that sentimental Victorian images of old age emerged. Sanctimonious attitudes towards older people seem to have developed almost as a cover for the loss of respect and role.</p>
<p>The result is a whole set of illogical attitudes to old people. For instance, although we’re living longer, fitter and healthier lives than ever before, we spend more time worrying about ageing: we get older later but fear getting older younger. This is particularly strange since technology has made brute strength less important. You’d imagine that, as a result, there’d be less prejudice against older people who are physically weaker than younger ones. Yet while ageing, argues the gerontologist Alan Walker, is a dynamic process and is changing all the time, public policy is locked into the past and lags behind lived experience by at least twenty years. This ‘structural lag’, as he calls it, prevents older people playing their full part in society.</p>
<p>Why did attitudes towards old people change so much? In 1972 a pair of social scientists, Donald Cowgill and Lowell Holmes, put forward a ‘modernization theory’. They argued that old people had higher status in preliterate societies than in modern industrialized states, where individual achievements were emphasized at the expense of the group.</p>
<p>Other researchers disagreed, insisting that the status of older people declined before modernization, and that we shouldn’t be misled by the public veneration of old people in the past: often, in private, people voiced rather less salubrious sentiments. And anyway, whatever people said and wrote, if you were old and poor in preindustrial times your life was likely to be pretty abject.</p>
<p>Still others claim that it wasn’t industrialization that made us less respectful towards older people but new ideas of social equality: why should one group deserve more reverence than any other? Yet urbanization and industrialization have undoubtedly had a major effect on attitudes towards ageing, even if the biggest shift happened a hundred years later, in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Old wasn’t always old-fashioned</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that, in the 1940s and 1950s, young people wanted to look older than they were. Parents magazine in 1956 featured clothing for adolescents: the models and the styles of suit they wore make them look 40 – to us now.</p>
<p>The journalist Katharine Whitehorn recalls borrowing her aunt’s dress for a Cambridge May ball in 1947: ‘who would borrow an aunt’s garment now?… we aspired to the same clothes as adults … it seems another world.’</p>
<p>Model Margot Smyly assumed the role of Vogue’s Mrs Exeter – with her white hair, restrained clothes (and pointedly married name), she seems ‘unrepentantly’ old to us now.</p>
<p>In the 1940s Vogue introduced a character called Mrs Exeter (in the form first of drawings and later a model) to represent the older woman. What strikes sociologist Julia Twigg, who has studied ageing and dress, is how ‘unrepentantly’ old Mrs Exeter – with her white hair and restrained clothes (and pointedly married name) – seems to us now. In 1949 Vogue wrote ‘Approaching 60, Mrs Exeter does not look a day younger, a fact she accepts with perfect good humour and reasonableness.’ To modern ears she might as well have been a visitor from another galaxy.</p>
<p>Old as bitter, not better</p>
<p>Most historians agree that, whenever the decline in status of old people began, ‘second modernity’ – the period of continuing rapid social change that started in the late twentieth century – accelerated the process. Certainly you can see the emergence of a new gerontophobia already in the youth culture of the 1960s, when popular music asked ‘Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I’m 64?’ and proclaimed ‘Hope I die before I get old’ to a generation whose mantra was ‘Never trust anyone over 30’.</p>
<p>The Graduate: The Robinsons look up at the bellowing Ben (Dustin Hoffman), their mouths contorted into a grotesque rictus of rage.</p>
<p>Nothing enshrined these attitudes better than Mike Nichols’s 1967 film The Graduate. Although Anne Bancroft was only 36 when she played the older woman, Mrs Robinson, she stands for everything that’s sterile and repressive in middle-aged, bourgeois culture. The film takes brilliant aim at almost every cultural institution – marriage, business, the church and education – but its ageism seems to have passed unnoticed. Beautiful, bitter Mrs Robinson tries to make her daughter’s life as attenuated as her own. In the glorious final church scene, just after Elaine has exchanged vows with the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) husband they’ve picked out for her, the Robinsons look up at the bellowing Ben (Dustin Hoffman), their mouths contorted into a grotesque rictus of rage. Trying to stop Elaine escaping with him, Mrs Robinson barks at her: ‘It’s too late!’ Retorts Elaine, ‘Not for me.’</p>
<p>Tainted by experience</p>
<p>Technology has transformed how we view old people. In slow-changing, traditional – predominantly oral – societies, elders were more likely to be valued because they transmitted knowledge, experience and indeed the history of the tribe to the next generation. Custodians of tradition, they could impart practical skills – everything from fishing to myths and songs – and continuity.</p>
<p>Today, in comparison, we suffer from what sociologist Richard Sennett calls ‘skills extinction’. If you’re an engineer, or even a lawyer, doctor or computer repairman, the skills that you learned in college no longer last a lifetime: skill isn’t a durable asset or experience a virtue any more. (When John Drummond, Controller of Radio 3 and Director of the Proms, objected to a change in the BBC, an administrator accused him of being ‘tainted by experience’.) It’s far cheaper to buy in a young new employee than pay to retrain an older one. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that anxieties about ageing that would have been regarded as pathological in the 1950s are today considered normal, as are the costly steps taken to counteract them.</p>
<p>We don’t value older people for their memories, either, since we assume that technology is going to do the remembering for us. It’s not just older people who are scared of ‘getting left behind’ – all of us are having to learn to live with long-term precariousness; we’re all only as good as our last project. This kind of anxious, ruthless individualism pits younger against older, and encourages us to see everyone as our rival.</p>
<p>Other cultures</p>
<p>So where can we look for inspiration – China? There the Confucian idea of ‘filial piety’ – an elaborate code of obligations demanding respect, patience and support – is so powerful it’s enshrined in law: Chinese adults are required to support their parents. Yet growing individualism, the fast pace of social change and the one-child policy, which places the responsibility of supporting two parents onto one child, are creating tensions. Young Chinese no longer feel the same respect for older people that their parents did.</p>
<p>What about Japan? In the mid-twentieth century it was seen as the older person’s nirvana. Compared to other industrial societies, Japanese old people enjoyed higher status, were more integrated into society, and were more likely to live with and see their children. There ‘filial piety’ combined with ancestor worship to create a deferential, paternalistic country. The most common word for old people in Japan was otoshiyori – ‘the honourable elders’.</p>
<p>Today young Japanese are increasingly ambivalent about their elders. They’ve coined a new phrase: kaigo-jigoku – the ‘care-giving hell’ of those who look after their relatives. Elder abuse is increasing and, although a high percentage of over-sixty-fives still live with their children, social security now does much of the work that filial piety did before.</p>
<p>All this is conveyed poignantly in Yasujiro Ozu’s screen masterpiece, Toyko Story (1953), in which an elderly couple make the long journey from their home to visit their children in Tokyo. Neither their hairdresser daughter nor their doctor son have time for them, paying for them to go to a noisy spa instead, and their youngest son, who lives outside Toyko, is equally nonchalant. Only their widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, treats them with love and respect. Tokyo Story is a melancholy portrait of the Japanese family in the throes of transition and ‘modernization’, as filial piety was turning from a daily practice into an abstract concept.</p>
<p>And otoshiyori? Today it’s increasingly used ironically.</p>
<p>Young vs old</p>
<p>Christopher Buckley’s satirical novel Boomsday opens with a TV news reporter covering a violent demonstration in Florida. Several hundred people in their twenties have stormed the gates of a ‘retirement community’, assaulting residents as they play golf. The target of their wrath is the nation’s 77 million baby boomers who, retiring on lavish pensions, are placing an intolerable strain on the American economy. They line up to support a young woman’s suggestion that the government give 75-year-olds incentives to kill themselves.</p>
<p>Outlandish, maybe, and a modern version of Trollope’s The Fixed Period, but the idea of young people rioting in hostility to old people seems rather less far-fetched today than in 2008 when the novel was first published and is the ultimate reversal of the veneration of older people.</p>
<p>Indeed the concept of intergenerational inequality has never been as prominent as it is today. In his recent book, The Pinch, David Willetts, Conservative MP and Minister for Universities and Science, argued that baby boomers have concentrated wealth in the hands of their own rich and powerful generation, so ensuring that young people will have to pay more taxes, work longer for less pay, won’t be able to afford to buy a house and will be left with an exorbitant level of national debt.</p>
<p>(Curiously he makes no mention of the fact that the government of which he’s a part, indeed his very own ministry, dramatically increased university tuition fees, thereby preventing today’s university students from enjoying the free higher education that he did.)</p>
<p>Again and again we find commentators evoking images of the greedy old, hogging jobs and houses and holding on tightly to businesses and assets, instead of letting these flow down to younger people in a generational transfer of wealth such as took place in earlier times.</p>
<p>This line of thought pits Us against Them and sees public policy as a zero-sum game: whatever They get leaves less for Us. Indeed pensions are characterized as a kind of Ponzi pyramid scheme, with the already-depleted current young having to shell out for the current old, without any prospect of it ever being reciprocated.</p>
<p>Older people are cast in a catch-22. If they retire early on a pension, they’re leeching off the young; if they continue to work beyond retirement age, they’re siphoning away jobs from young people. If they buy big houses they’re inflating the housing bubble; if they downsize to smaller properties they’re taking houses that should rightly go to young families. Free TV licences, winter fuel benefits – it’s jam today, paid for by a generation that can expect jam never.</p>
<p>There’s even a bespoke body, the Intergenerational Foundation, that exists ‘to protect the rights of younger and future generations in British policymaking’ (presumably against rapacious oldies). It publishes an annual Intergenerational Fairness Index, which logs how far the position of the younger generation is worsening.</p>
<p>But this is binary thinking at its most dangerous. It fuels gerontophobia, and aggravates old people’s already hefty fears of becoming a burden. And it does no favours to young people either, making it even harder for them to identify with older people, seeding an anxiety about getting older and becoming burdensome themselves, and generally positioning them as angry toddlers, having a tantrum because they’re not getting what they want and think they’re due.</p>
<p>What’s worse, it plays into the current polarized ‘scrounger’ discourse of ‘skivers’ and ‘strivers’. In the past, older people seemed safely beyond the reach of discussions about the ‘deserving’ and ‘undeserving’ poor. But increasingly now, argues gerontologist Alan Walker, there’s an attempt to identify them with the ‘undeserving poor’.</p>
<p>The housing and employment prospects of young people today are undoubtedly grim, but the concept of ‘intergenerational inequity’ – a term that originated in the United States in the 1980s from concerns that the pensions of an increasingly ageing population would prove unaffordable – rests on a fundamental distortion: that of a baby boomer generation which is uniformly wealthy. In reality, of course, old people and even ‘new’ pensioners include some of the poorest people in our society. While some of this cohort made a lot of money on the property market or through shares, an awful lot of them didn’t, just as there are many young people doing well financially today, although most of them aren’t.</p>
<p>It’s the economy, stupid, and the political structure that determines who benefits and who doesn’t; social classes infinitely more than age-groups hoard social assets for their own. Similarly it was a political ideology, Thatcherism – rather than everyone who happened to be alive in the 1980s – that initiated the ideology of rolling back the state, continued by New Labour and accelerated by the current Conservative government.</p>
<p>The whole idea of ‘generational accounting’, a financial balance sheet of contributions and benefits drawn up throughout the life cycle, is challenged by sociologists Claudine Attias-Donfut and Sara Arber in The Myth of Generational Conflict. For example, the generation that took part in post-war reconstruction but may have paid relatively little in contributions: have they taken more than they’ve given? Or what about women who spent decades raising children? They may not have paid much income tax or National Insurance but have given years of unpaid labour to produce the next generation of citizens, as have those who care for the last one.</p>
<p>What’s more, generational inequalities are only one type of inequality – much more modest, as Attias-Donfut and Arber point out, than inequalities based on class, gender and ethnicity. Yet rarely does the aggrieved young columnist who rails about their difficulty buying a flat devote equal column inches to households where poverty is multigenerational, or to the fact that women continue to earn significantly less than men.</p>
<p>In reality, the youngest and oldest members of society tend to be the poorest: far from dividing them, this is what they share. And when state benefits are given to the oldest members of a family, the advantages tend to trickle down to its other generations too. Interestingly, too, the countries that have the fewest inequalities between generations also have the fewest inequalities within them.</p>
<p>So why have these incorrect but harmful ideas about generational conflict flourished so much over the past few years? One reason is the slashing of public spending: when resources are limited, of course, competition over them increases, and with it comes the search for a scapegoat. State and public-sector pensions have also been caught up in the demonization of anything connected with public spending.</p>
<p>Age ghettoes</p>
<p>But there’s another factor that has contributed to the virulence of the present debate – one which has particular bearing on our experience of growing older: age segregation. Apartheid may have been dismantled but age-apartheid has intensified. We’ve age-cleansed our society. Under the banner of welfare we’ve corralled old people into day-care centres and homes; removed them from families, schools, universities, workplaces, general-hospital wards and sports centres, creating age ghettoes. It might soon be perfectly possible to go through life without meeting an old person until you become one. No wonder the prospect of ageing is terrifying.</p>
<p>Perhaps we want older people removed from view because they stand as a permanent reminder that we too will get old and die? Author and activist Betty Friedan argued that people who could no longer ‘pass’ as young had to be quarantined lest they contaminate the rest of us.</p>
<p>Of course it’s easy to dismiss nursing homes as segregationist – when you don’t need them. Nor is this a plea for a return to the past, where ‘daughter care’ was taken for granted, and it was assumed that women’s financial needs and aspirations should be sacrificed for the needs of older relatives. Until we’re prepared to face up to our own ageing instead of seeing older people as taking what should be ours, it will be hard to have a proper national debate about the kinds of care for older people that most of us would wish for the people we love, and for ourselves.</p>
<p>Some older people choose to sequester themselves away from younger ones. Let’s not forget ‘retirement communities’ – adult-only, child-free villages, where you’re guaranteed never to meet anyone substantially younger than yourself. Why would you rule out other people purely on the basis of their age? Part of their appeal, some residents claim, is that they protect old people from the prejudice and discrimination of young people. Yet, insofar as they help the rest of us to deny our own ageing, they just make these worse.</p>
<p>Indeed young people’s lack of contact with old people not only encourages them to believe that they’ll never get old, but also to treat old people as if they’d never been young. This is especially easy to do in fast-moving societies where your degree of ease with social media, digital devices and apps seems to mark you out as a member of a younger age cohort, although in reality it’s not because you’re young that you can swiftly master these widgets but because of when you’re young. In the pre-Internet era, technical skill wasn’t a marker of youth. On the contrary, older people were more likely to have accumulated technical know-how. Particular abilities and beliefs aren’t intrinsic to an age-group but to an era, and if that’s when you’re young and impressionable you’re more likely to absorb them.</p>
<p>Yet we brand people as members of age cohorts, among other things through ‘generational marketing’: special products and facilities for ‘the old’ and ‘the young’. Some claim that these improve the quality of life, but their effect is to exile older and younger people in separate age Bantustans, rather than integrate them into the social world. Cinemas, for instance, often run special ‘senior screenings’ midmorning at a discounted rate, with free tea or coffee and biscuits. But mightn’t unemployed young people appreciate these too?</p>
<p>The effects of age segregation</p>
<p>There’s a direct link between age segregation and ageism: when we don’t encounter older people casually, regularly as part of our daily life, we screen them out of what gerontologist Bill Bytheway called our ‘conceptual maps’, too. Perhaps it’s not surprising that three-quarters of the 84 Facebook groups, totalling 25,000 members, that used synonyms for ‘old’, ‘aged’ or ‘elderly’ examined in a recent study by the Yale School of Public Health were found to have vilified elderly people. Facebook expressly forbids hate speech directed at various groups, but older people are not among them. ‘Everyone over the age of 69 should immediately face a firing squad’ was typical of some of the comments posted. Created by 20- to 29-year-olds, more than one-third of these groups advocated banning older people from public activities like shopping.</p>
<p>Age segregation denies the fact that interests and preoccupations cross the ages: you can love reggae or oppose the renewal of Trident whatever your age – instead of age dividing us, passions can unite us. All the evidence – and there are banks of it – suggests that integrating the ages is transformative. If we have a wide range of age contacts, we stay vital and engaged for longer. And the more contact that young people have with older people, the more favourably they regard them, and the more positively they view their own ageing.</p>
<p>To challenge prejudice a recent American reality-TV series, Forever Young, thrust five under-thirties together with five over-seventies in a Big Brother-style house. By the end it was tears and mutual appreciation all round, despite the increasing frustration of the ‘juniors’ trying to induct the ‘seniors’ in new technology – ‘Just click it!’</p>
<p>Research confirms that we judge older family members, like grandparents, in less stereotyped ways than older strangers. When Professor of English Kathleen Woodward taught a class on literature and ageing to American university students, she was struck by the way they split older people into two types. There were those they knew well, like grandparents and great-grandparents, whom they didn’t see exclusively in terms of age – indeed sometimes their age didn’t figure as important at all. Then there were those whom they didn’t know personally, who were entirely subsumed beneath the label and stereotypes of ‘old’.</p>
<p>Interage</p>
<p>We hear a lot about generational discord and jealousy, but far less about intergenerational solidarity, despite the emergence of some fabulous initiatives. Generations United, for instance, is an American organization trying to stimulate intergenerational collaboration. It runs a Best Intergenerational Communities award – a telling contrast to the Intergenerational Fairness Index.</p>
<p>Magic Me, the leading British organizer of intergenerational projects, links young people aged 8-plus with adults aged 60-plus in creative activities – music, dance, photography, printmaking, drama – as well conversation and an exchange of ideas. As one head teacher said, the young people involved ‘begin to realize what they can learn from other generations.’ Among its projects are Cocktails in Care Homes, monthly evening cocktail parties for residents of homes in East London. Through this initiative, a volunteer remarked, one resident ‘has now relearnt the art of conversation.’</p>
<p>Art Cart, an American intergenerational arts project, links graduate students with ageing professional artists. The students help the professionals prepare and document their work, gaining valuable educational experience in the process. Homeshare programmes around the world introduce older homeowners who’d value company and assistance to younger people threatened with homelessness. In the USA ‘cyber-grandparents’, aged 60 to 105, are supplied by the Elder Wisdom Circle to provide anonymous advice to people in their twenties and thirties. Berlin has opened Europe’s first multigenerational housing project for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p>
<p>When the Crosstalk project brought together children and old people in small towns in Italy and Germany to talk about the games and toys each had played with, the children were surprised at how mischievous the older people had been. After the project ended, they greeted the older people by name whenever they saw them. The older people were no longer a generic category: they’d become individuals with a real past and childhoods with which the children could identify.</p>
<p>Intergenerational friendship</p>
<p>But while organized schemes and projects like this have an important role to play, equally mind-shifting are informal cross-age friendships. Most of us today fraternize mainly with our age peers, and while there are all sorts of stage-of-life things that are best shared with them, it’s also limiting – as though you’ve never got over the propaganda dispensed when we’re at school, where age is seen as the great definer, and people are either ‘above’ or ‘below’ you. (Michael Young, the sociologist who helped found the Open University, claimed that our age-stratified culture resembled a caste society: the one we’re born into we have to stay with throughout our lives.)</p>
<p>For Lucy, a 63-year-old teacher, this started to change in her late twenties. ‘First I met someone in his seventies at a demonstration and became friendly with him and his wife. Then I met a couple of women much older than me – one in her late seventies, the other in her early eighties. And we were so alike! It was great to become friends with people my parents’ age, but who didn’t share their politics or opinions – they made me realize that I wouldn’t have to give up mine as I aged. Now I’ve got friends who are older and who are much younger, and I find it exciting to mix them up. I’d say the age span of my friends is around forty years.’</p>
<p>Maitri House, an example of intergenerational community in Maryland, USA.</p>
<p>This only works, though, if you’ve accepted your own stage of the life cycle, and aren’t too envious of younger people or triumphant towards older ones. Carola, 68, says, ‘My life has improved enormously as I’ve got older, so I don’t envy my younger friends, though I’m impressed at how much better they manage their lives than I did when I was their age. I think – I hope – that in me they have someone who makes them less scared of ageing. That’s certainly what my older friends do for me.’</p>
<p>The writer Diana Athill maintains that contact with younger people can counter a tendency towards pessimism in old age. Watching a younger person at the beginning of their life is not only interesting, she argues, but reminds us not to waste our time complaining. For Shirley, a member of the older women’s network the Hen Co-op, her sons, their partners, her younger women friends and the students with whom she’s worked ‘have taught me to loosen my sexual inhibitions, to have greater tolerance to those I do not understand.’</p>
<p>The Gray Panthers, founded in 1972 by Maggie Kuhn, believed in a coalition of young and old. ‘When I think of all the children who have little meaningful contact with old people,’ wrote Kuhn, ‘I fear for the world.’ Young people living in stress-filled homes with striving parents, she believed, needed the time and deeper perspective of older people. Yet with growing anxiety about paedophilia, opportunities for contacts between older people and younger have probably shrunk more than ever.</p>
<p>Kuhn herself lived intergenerationally. From her seventies until her death at 89, she shared her house in Philadelphia with young housemates. She wasn’t, she insisted, a parent figure to them, nor did she patronize them. ‘I like to talk to them about my life and listen to them talk about theirs … By talking to people in their sixties, seventies and eighties, young people can get a sense that bad times come and go, that history and large social forces play a part in their personal dramas, and that life is finite.’</p>
<p>But cross-age friendships and working partnerships don’t just mean an alliance of the very young and the very old: they’re about opening yourself to relationships across the age span, so that one’s friendship group includes people of all ages – young, adolescent, young adult, middle-aged and old. This helps develop our sense of ourselves as constantly changing, and our understanding that we can find kindred spirits of every age, at every age. Such relationships are a wonderful way of dispelling the rigid ideas with which we’ve been inculcated about what happens, or is supposed to, at each stage in life. Seeing people of all ages as potential friends requires a radical switch in thinking. But by nurturing friendships across the life cycle, we begin to understand that we can learn from, and be inspired by, people at any age.
