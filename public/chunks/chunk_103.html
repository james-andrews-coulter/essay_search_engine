        <h2>XConclusion</h2>
<p>We need an extraordinary run of good fortune to make a success of our careers: an early understanding of our talents and interests; the right educational opportunities; the best kind of inferiority complex; a benign political environment; physical and mental health; confidence, stamina, friends; a lack of scandals; a propitious number of lucky breaks; clumsy enemies; supportive relationships; an untragic sexuality; an upbeat temperament… And all this needs to be in place not for one or two years, but – so that we’ll be more than mere flashes-in-the-pan – for four decades at least.</p>
<p>We should not be surprised if we don’t quite get there. We were not uncommonly stupid. We were tricked into misunderstanding the statistics of success, in mistaking the unique for the possible. We longed for glorious destinies, of which there are always far fewer than there are numbers of the aspiring and the ardent. The game is close to rigged so as to cause heartbreak on a mass scale, although the sadness rarely recognises itself as collective, and is experienced in each individual soul as a uniquely personal defeat.</p>
<p>Our minds are partly to blame. We are hardwired for ambitious plans. It isn’t our nature to rest with what is already to hand or easy to reach. We are inherently ungrateful, and feel alive only when we have taken on a struggle that has a good chance of crushing us. Even those we think of as successes will secretly nurse dreams they have had to forego. There is always a gap between achievement and desire. Feeling like a failure is the inevitable price for harbouring any sort of ambition.</p>
<p>We would be mad not to strive for success, but we will end up demented if we don’t also, over time, develop capacities for making peace with defeat. The task begins with forewarning, with a secure, calm, dark knowledge that we will inevitably be tripped up along the way.</p>
<p>We need to be free of a sense of persecution in this regard. It truly was not personal. Our dreams are like a fragile house of twigs exposed to a hurricane. We should stop fixating on what life has done to us, and check in with what it is doing to others every day – the ones who never make it into the magazines; the legions of the quietly despairing and dying. It is no loser’s counsel to work with a vivid sense of how much worse it might, and will still, get.</p>
<p>We should make ourselves at home with mediocrity.</p>
<p>‘Failure’ sounds like too extreme a word for something that is so normal. We should be more alive to its ubiquity and wear it with greater ease, as something – like death – that is coming for us all. We might laugh defiantly at its embrace, refuse to be cowed by it and mock our pretensions without remorse or self-importance.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy, of course, that we are typically surrounded by people trapped in a toxic ideology of ambition. The first question we will be asked when meeting almost any new person is: ‘What do you do?’ If our answer is insufficiently elevated, we will at once notice the loss of interest and our total dispensability to most members of the race.</p>
<p>These things continue to matter more than they should. We should try to be gentle on ourselves. We could reduce how often we’ll be exposed to this sort of judgement. We might attempt to develop an identity not so exclusively connected to achievement, so that who we are becomes bound up not just with salary and rank, but also our character, our relationships, our interests and our unmonetised and unpublished skills.</p>
<p>We should learn the wisdom of a degree of melancholy in relation to our work, founded on an understanding that the sorrow isn’t just about us; that our suffering belongs to humanity in general. This should not make us desperate, but rather more forgiving of our failure, kinder to that of others and better able to focus on what really matters, while there is still time.</p>
