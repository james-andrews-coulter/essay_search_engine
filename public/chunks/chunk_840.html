        <h2>23. ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES TO STAYING OR LEAVING?</h2>
<p>When it comes to what sort of relationships we are offered, our societies tend to present us with a menu with only one option: the monogamous, cohabiting Romantic relationship, usually served with a side order of children.</p>
<p>To be considered normal, we are meant to develop overwhelming emotional and sexual feelings for one very special person, who will then become a combination of our best friend, sole sexual partner, co-parent, business associate, therapist, travel companion, property co-manager, kindergarten teacher and soulmate – and with whom we will live exclusively in one house, in one bed, for many decades, in substantial harmony and with an active tolerance for each other’s foibles and ongoing desire for their evolving appearance, till death do us part.</p>
<p>But what is striking, for an arrangement supposed to be normal, is how many people cannot abide by its rules. At least half flunk completely, and a substantial portion muddle along in quiet desperation. At best, only around fifteen percent of the population admit to being totally satisfied – a thought-inducingly low figure for a menu option claiming universal validity.</p>
<p>In our societies, those who can’t get on with Romantic monogamous marriage are quickly diagnosed as suffering from a variety of psychological disorders: fear of intimacy, clinginess, sexual addiction, frigidity, boundary issues, self-sabotage, childhood trauma, etc. We powerfully imply that someone might be psychologically ill if they don’t want to keep having sex exclusively with the same partner, or seek to spend every other weekend apart, or want to develop a close friendship elsewhere.</p>
<p>But the reason why we may find it so hard to know whether to stay in or leave a relationship isn’t that there is one answer that, mysterious and stupidly, we simply can’t locate. It’s that no existing answer is actually appealing. This is an insight that our Romantic culture refuses to help us to contemplate with the clarity it deserves. We don’t want fully to leave, and we don’t want fully to stay. Yet we push this thought away because it sounds impossible and spoilt. How could we possibly stay and not stay at the same time? However, perhaps this mad-sounding wish is actually very sane, because it picks up on a hidden error in our thinking – that we only have two options.</p>
<p>We’d recognise this instantly if someone said: ‘You have to make a choice: You can either go on a beach holiday and swim for six hours every day, or you can go to a city, but it has to be Geneva. Don’t be indecisive! Which will it be?’ It would be reasonable to be maddened by the options: Why just these specific packages? The beach could be lovely, but why so much swimming? A city could be marvellous, but why does it have to be Geneva? The problem deciding lies not in us, but in the choice we’re being offered.</p>
<p>The Romantic model is so familiar that we easily forget that it’s a very particular and recent amalgam of roles that have in the past, and could again in the future, exist independently. We might liberate ourselves from the harsh dichotomy by looking at a few alternatives to staying or leaving.</p>
<p>i. Erotic friendship</p>
<p>In 1745, the king of France, Louis XV, invited Jeanne Antoinette Poisson (soon to be ennobled and called by her more recognisable name, Madame de Pompadour) to be his ‘official’ mistress. He installed her in a grand apartment and, for the next few years, spent most afternoons and many nights in her company.</p>
<p>This was not a secretive arrangement; Madame de Pompadour became enormously influential because everyone knew of her deep intimacy with the king. And it was not seen as a threat to his marriage; there was no question of a divorce and, in fact, the queen and Madame de Pompadour became good friends.</p>
<p>The idea of a publicly respectable mistress was based on a view about marriage: it was accepted that there might be many excellent reasons for two people to be married, but that these wouldn’t necessarily include great personal closeness. This is what had happened with Louis. While still in his teens, he married Princess Marie Leczinska of Poland. She was an excellent partner in many ways: they had lots of children together; she was very religious and was popular with the wider public; she was also a helpfully neutral figure between the contending political factions at court. These were not minor considerations, and Louis never regretted marrying her.</p>
<p>The thing that strikes us as strange, but that is potentially so helpful to consider, is that a relationship might be healthy and successful yet involve one or both (to update the story) of the partners sleeping with other people. The crucial foundation is that the couple is very clear about other reasons why they are together. The grounds for their union are so compelling, and the basis of respect and admiration is so strong, that there’s no great need to worry about who else the other person might, quite regularly, be spending the early evening or weekend afternoons with.</p>
<p>ii. The parenting couple</p>
<p>When it comes to the children, two people might be fully united. They’re both there at dinner time; they share the ritual of the evening bath and the bedtime story; they’re both around at breakfast; they take family holidays together. But other than that, they live independent lives. They’re not checking who is seeing whom or what the other is doing on Tuesday afternoons; they don’t feel ownership of each other’s existence. They have separated their finances and don’t talk much about anything other than the children.</p>
<p>They’re not staying together ‘for the sake of the children’ (an always uncomfortable arrangement), because they aren’t genuinely together. They have separated – just not entirely because there’s still one very important task they’re undertaking together and will continue to for many years.</p>
<p>In the past, the two used to squabble or be frosty with one another in front of the children because their role as parents was embedded in a highly unsatisfactory relationship as partners. Now they’re more focused and serene. Letting go of expectations for true intimacy and understanding has freed them to be kind and respectful of one another as they prepare supper.</p>
<p>iii. The companion</p>
<p>While still married, you also have a special friend. It’s not sexual: you’re not mutually attracted, so you’re not tempted to have an affair with them. But you speak to them more or less every day and discuss the details of your life; you see them frequently and help each other in lots of ways. Your companion might sit down with you and go through paying the bills or you might assemble some flat-pack furniture together. It’s like friendship, but it moves into areas that we’ve wrongly come to see as the exclusive realm of what couples are supposed to do together.</p>
<p>This kind of arrangement has been formalised at various times and in different places. In Japan, a man might spend some evenings with a geisha. No sex would be on offer – perhaps only mild flirtation. Rather, the geisha is a specialist in the arts of entertainment and conversation: witty, a sympathetic listener, who can lighten the mood or capture a delicate thought.</p>
<p>Or in Italy, in the eighteenth century, a noble woman might have had a cavaliere, or ‘knight’: a male companion who would be charming and kind; they’d have lunch together, go shopping, attend parties; when the lady went travelling to visit friends in the country, the cavaliere would accompany her and ensure the carriage was loaded up with some agreeable snacks for the journey.</p>
<p>In essence, the idea is to separate out companionship from the rest of a relationship. It doesn’t mean the couple has no contact, just that differences in temperament don’t become unbearable. Your primary partner may be very good in all sorts of ways, but they are so busy, or they hate shopping, or they aren’t much of a conversationalist. Normally, these points of incompatibility could be fatal. But they needn’t be with the right companion in one’s life.</p>
<p>iv. The sex club</p>
<p>It’s a rainy Wednesday night; in a darkened room, discreetly tucked away in a side street, a logistics manager is being flogged by a trainee architect and a retired engineer is putting a leash round the neck of a marketing executive. Most of these people are married, but they’re here without their partners.</p>
<p>At the club, sex is detached from intimacy. The participants know almost nothing about each other – perhaps not even their names. They don’t have long, flirtatious conversations or swap phone numbers. It can sound brutish because we’d ideally like sex to be closely aligned with love. But in reality, some of us develop highly specific erotic desires. It’s not a matter of choice: we just discover that we’re immensely excited by wearing a rubber costume or by being loudly sworn at. The thought of never doing these things makes us miserable.</p>
<p>Yet for entirely valid and comprehensible reasons, our partner might be unable to participate in these activities. We’ve tried gentle suggestions; we’ve explained our interest as best we can. It’s not a question of good will: our partner is left utterly cold by such ideas. Our relationship might be fine in many other important ways, but the distress that can accumulate around this one area may put everything under strain, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>The Romantic model of relationships ineluctably drives us towards a tragic decision: either we stay in the union, but have to accept that an important part of our soul isn’t going to be understood, or we have to abandon everything that’s good and important in our relationship for the sake of a few hours of pleasure every week.</p>
<p>The sex club rejects this binary choice. It offers to target a precise erotic longing, but only that. And by so doing, it can liberate us to properly appreciate everything else that’s right and intimate in our relationship.</p>
<p>v. The holiday marriage</p>
<p>Instead of living together all year round, this couple spends most of their time apart – but they get together for two weeks over New Year and longer in the summer, and maybe a couple of other times. It’s a long-term commitment. They do it year after year and wouldn’t think of breaking the arrangement. When they’re together, they go out to dinner, they are warm to each other and they have long, intimate conversations.</p>
<p>These are people who feel deeply connected to one another, but who have realised that living together most of the time is agony. They were at odds over what colour to paint the bathroom walls, what time to get up in the morning, whether to live in the city or the country, whether each was pulling their weight financially and how to divide up the domestic chores. Sex might not have been very good either. The holiday model frankly admits that living together continuously is unbearable, but it doesn’t take this as the end of the relationship. Instead it separates the quotidian frustrations from the underlying question of closeness or love.</p>
<hr />
<p>These alternative options might look like second best – an embarrassing climb-down from what we’re supposed to really want, which is the unified relationship in which a couple does everything together. But that might not actually be what we, ourselves, long for. The Romantic model was a deliberate, difficult creation. Starting in the late eighteenth century, particularly in France, a very few people decided that what they most desired was a relationship in which everything was shared and in which their domestic companion was also their lover. They were regarded as freakish and unnatural. But over time they portrayed their ideals so eloquently and beautifully in poems, paintings, sermons, novels and plays that this way of having a relationship came to seem like a universal obligation.</p>
<p>But it is, in fact, quite odd that we take there to be just one single model of what a proper relationship should be like. We don’t impose this type of standard measure on ourselves in other areas of existence. We don’t think there is just one kind of ideal job that everyone must have, or one kind of good holiday, or one type of house that everyone should live in. In general, we’re much more flexible in recognising that our own needs might vary quite a lot from the statistical norm and yet not be any less valid or authentic.</p>
<p>When we’re struggling with the question ‘Stay or leave?’ we may, behind the scenes, be doing something surprisingly creative. We’re trying to imagine how we would really like to live with a person whom we love, but who (like everyone) is radically imperfect in some ways and cannot fathom important parts of us. As with so many creative acts, the ideas we come up with will, at first, sound very strange. Like those who evolved the idea of the Romantic model, we are pioneers. We’re trying to define as carefully and as plausibly as we can why some as-yet-unfamiliar way of living might, in practice, be the best arrangement for us.</p>
<p>It would be a genuine liberation if, whenever a new couple came together, it was assumed that they almost certainly would not go along with the Romantic, monogamous template, and that the onus was therefore on them to discuss – up front, in good faith and without insult – the alternative arrangements that would ideally satisfy their natures. Extra marks would be awarded for innovation and out-of-the-box schemes, while protestations of satisfaction at the standard model would raise eyebrows.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, male offspring of the European upper classes had only two career options: to join the army or to join the church. Such narrowmindedness was eventually dismissed as evident nonsense and eradicated; the average citizen of a developed country now has at least 4,000 job options to choose from. We should strive for a comparable expansion of our menus of love. We are not so much bad at relationships as unable to understand our needs without shame, to stick up politely for what makes us content, and to invent practical arrangements that could stand a chance of honouring our complex emotional reality.</p>
