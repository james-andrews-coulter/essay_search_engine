        <h3>We rarely, if ever, have sex now</h3>
<p>One of the standard things we might hear, when someone explains to us why they left their partner is that ‘we hadn’t had sex for years’. The plea picks up on the basic notion that a key sign of the health and viability of any relationship lies in the frequency of sexual contact between its participants. The end of sex must therefore legitimately and necessarily signal the end of love.</p>
<p>But if we lift the lid on what sex actually means, we might conclude something a little different. Suppose we ask the bizarre-sounding question: why do we actually want sex? The ordinary answer is that we want it for pleasure and excitement. But this might not, in fact, be very accurate about our needs. There are lots of sources of pleasure (and, indelicately but honestly, we can note that masturbation can be very pleasurable, too). A less familiar but deeper answer may be that really, via sex, we are seeking proof of affection and enthusiasm. When we’re rebuffed sexually, the pain isn’t just that we won’t be having an orgasm with a person, it’s that we are being given a sense that they don’t particularly like us. The sting is to our sense of lovability rather than just to our nerve endings.</p>
<p>So we could say that under the surface of bitterness about sex, it’s never strictly only how much sex is going on that matters, but how much affection, tenderness, interest and warmth is being demonstrated. Sex is operating as a proxy measure, but it’s not in itself the thing that truly counts. We could easily imagine having a lot of sex without love – and suffering because of it. Or being loved deeply but for whatever reason not having much sex – and being content.</p>
<p>This helps us to put a more accurate finger on when a lack of sex should realistically become a matter for dissent or a parting of ways. Insofar as an absence of sex is independent of any shortfall in love, we should stay. Insofar as it is further evidence of a decline and absence of love, we could be following the logic of the heart to leave.</p>
