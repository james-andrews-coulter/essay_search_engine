            <h2>A Life Devoid of Narcissism</h2>
<p>Narcissism – named after Narcissus, the young and handsome Greek mythological figure who was afflicted by an immoderate pride in his own appearance – is a state of mind that is typically condemned and ridiculed by sensible voices. We associate maturity with scepticism towards ourselves, and an inclination towards modesty and self-deprecation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a number of psychologists have pointed out the importance of a quality known as ‘healthy narcissism’ – by which is meant a nourishing, basic level of satisfaction with how we are perceived, how we look and what we have done and said. Healthy narcissism is demonstrated in the little glow we feel when someone pays us a compliment or when we’re told that a mutual acquaintance respects us; when we see our name on a report we spent many months working on or when we are invited to contribute to a conference in our professional field. Catching our reflection in a shop window in a city street, we might – as healthy narcissists – feel a little lift at the passing thought that we’re looking rather nice at the moment.</p>
<p>Extreme failure shatters every opportunity for this kind of low-level and sustaining self-regard. Narcissism of any sort becomes simply impossible. Given the level of our shame and the amount of condemnation from others, it is hard to think of anything remotely connected with who we are that doesn’t make us close our eyes and wince. We cannot bear to think of our past achievements; they merely remind us of our subsequent disasters and idiocies. We are embarrassed to think of everything to do with who we are. Our very name – infamous on the lips of many – frightens us. We avoid the slightest encounters with our own faces. We don’t really want to exist as a topic of reflection for ourselves. We come to be about as far away from narcissism, of any kind, as it’s possible for a human to be.</p>
<p>So extreme is this stance, that it must be examined for its lessons. Its horrific dimensions are of course evident. It would be so comforting if only we were able to like ourselves a bit more; to hold on to the idea that we are not only a monster or a fool; to have access to some echo of the feeling we had in childhood when we were told we were good and sweet, when we were cuddled and our hair was stroked. But our self-censoring mechanisms no longer allow it. We cannot have an agreeable past, future or present. Our essential self is contaminated and therefore something we are impelled to ignore.</p>
<p>Through this emotional turmoil, however, we unexpectedly come close to a state of mind lauded by the most accomplished sages of the Buddhist tradition. For Buddhists, ultimate enlightenment is reached when we finally manage to obliterate the self and see the world without the distracting, petty and vain distorting lens of the ‘I’. For a true sage, who we happen to be is an entirely random and negligible accident, which we must strive to move beyond; it shouldn’t matter what we look like, how others perceive us, whether we were born rich or poor, what people are saying about us or how long we will live. All that counts is to pierce the veil of immediate and petty illusion in order to attune ourselves to the broadest totality of being: to take our place as an observer of cosmic reality. A sage will strive (through exhaustive meditative practices) to forget everything about their self; they seek to merge with the universe and take their rightful, anonymous, temporary place alongside wind, rocks, the raging oceans and billions of dying stars.</p>
<p>Through the most ghastly process, we will have entirely overcome ourselves. Without subscribing to any spiritual groups, we’ll have managed to focus single-mindedly on things beyond us. This isn’t what anyone but a few die-hard monks might be seeking, but there is – arguably – a degree of genuine achievement behind our exquisite pain. We now endure in a curious, liminal space: we can’t really exist to ourselves any more, and yet we are still obliged to be alive. Unlike most other people on the planet, we are extensively dissociated from our own being; we can’t think of our bodies, our pasts, our futures or our selves in the minds of others. None of that matters – or it is, more accurately, past bothering with. We are instead entirely focused on what is beyond us; pure observers of the world outside of our selves.</p>
<p>For Buddhists, this kind of liberation is an end in itself. For us, it threatens – on its own – to be a hollow and eerie state. We need to convert it into the first step towards a more redemptive and tolerable condition: a life that we can live in the service of causes that are somehow ‘larger’ than we are. We’ll have fulfilled the promise of our pain and self-abnegation when we succeed in placing something compellingly meaningful at the centre of our scarred lives: a deserving cause beyond us. It might be a job, a project, a suffering child or adult … We have no option but to forget ourselves and to live for others.</p>
