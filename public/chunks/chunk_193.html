        <h1>1. The Clocks Within</h1>
<p>‘I was out early before breakfast this morning bathing from the sands. There was a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked
      to the sea, where the waves were curling white with foam and the red morning sunshine glowed upon the naked limbs of the bathers.’</p>
<p>(FRANCIS KILVERT,1872)</p>
<p>We have looked at some of the practical ways of immersing ourselves in nature, but so far we have managed to keep ourselves – the subject of this book – largely
  away from the lower end of the microscope. No longer.</p>
<p>Physiology students at Imperial College London are taught about circadian rhythms with the help of a rectal thermometer. By measuring their own temperatures over the course of a day, the
  students learn that our body temperature follows a cycle. From a trough very early in the morning, at about 5 a.m., it rises to a peak about twelve hours later. There is typically a variation
  between peaks and troughs of 1°c, and although that may not sound massive on first reading, bear in mind that a rise of 1°c is a symptom of influenza.</p>
<p>A fluctuation in body temperature is one of the few straightforward indicators that scientists have been able to use to monitor the roller-coaster of wakefulness and sleepiness that we all
  experience every day. One thing we all know from our own experience, and which science has confirmed, is that we do not all get on the same ride. Each of us experiences different peaks and troughs
  of wakefulness each day.</p>
<p>By the time the animal kingdom and plant kingdoms divorced, early in the evolution of life on earth, the genes that enable a sensitivity to the daily cycle of light and dark were already
  established. They can be found in human DNA, and we share them with other animals and most basic plants to this day. Each time we see the sun set, changes are triggered within us and every living
  thing around us.</p>
<p>Sleepiness and wakefulness are parts of the physiological ride, but they are not the only things that fluctuate throughout the day. Our individual alertness, mood and energy levels will be
  influenced by blood sugar, insulin response, allergies, exercise, smells, colours and temperature – and that is before we consider any of the stimulants or sedatives, like caffeine or
  alcohol, we tend to lob into the system for good measure. In short, the way we feel, and therefore our experience of our surroundings, is shaped by the nature within us.</p>
<p>We are subject to hormonal tides, ones that rise and fall daily, monthly and yearly. Women pick up pheromone cues from other women in their perspiration, and it is this that leads to a
  synchronization of menstrual cycles in women who live together. With the variations of the hormone cycle, the individual’s sense of alertness, wellbeing and mood also changes. There are many
  women who will assert that a flower does not look equally beautiful at all times of the month. But men will also be fighting upheavals, not least in tidal surges of testosterone. A man who is
  trying to admire a wildflower with a woman he finds very attractive may have to focus more consciously than the woman. And they might both find a wildflower hard to appreciate at 10 p.m., even
  under torchlight, as this is the most common time for lovemaking – a consequence of circadian rhythms leading to a particular cultural convention.</p>
<p>We are only keeping step with the rest of the animal kingdom in these habits. Black cats are not lucky between March and May, because this is when mature toms go for a wander in search of a mate
  and are most likely to be killed crossing a road. Hedgehog road-deaths also peak at this time, with male deaths outnumbering females by a ratio of 2 to 1. Most animals mate at the time of year
  (indicated by day length) that will lead to birth at a time when food is most prevalent. So the male human testosterone level peaks in October, and the fact foragers are busy in late summer is
  related – nature has ensured that more babies are born in the late summer months when there is more food around.</p>
<p>Both the man and the woman will find the same species of flower appears subtly different with each passing year, as age shapes us, both through the accumulation of experiences and the natural
  ageing process. It becomes harder to smell the flower after middle age, and harder to hear the birds around it. Ageing is not all downhill, however, and the Owl of Minerva comes late: wisdom, that
  hard-to-define quality, gives us an ability to appreciate smaller things with time. The half-scent of a rose may offer a richer experience to an eighty-year-old than the full scent would to a
  twenty-year-old.</p>
<p>Psychological cycles ride on top of our physiological ones. Our financial or emotional security will influence our experience of the world, and this is true regardless of our situation. The
  wealthiest person in the world can still hate the world, while the Weyemba people of Sumba in Indonesia feel that their own economic progress has impacted on astronomy: ‘the moon rises
  differently and the sun sets differently now’, they believe.</p>
<p>Exercise 14</p>
<p>Imagine a scene: you are looking from halfway up a hill, across a valley, with sunlight reflecting off a meandering river. There are cattle in the fields, and patches of
      mixed woodland breaking up the pasture. A pink rock stands at the corner of one field. Add a few elements of your own, allow your imagination to fill some blanks. Now hold onto that view.</p>
<p>You are feeling triumphant from a successful walk, and your walking companion has just suggested something that promises an interesting afternoon and possibly evening. You are alert, it is
      mid-morning, the coffee at breakfast was good and the breakfast was better. You slept well on sheets that had surely been ironed, and you’re looking forward to another four days of
      similar pleasures, during this short walking holiday. Take in the view before you. Pick out each detail. Use the sun to work out the time and the direction you are looking in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the evening did not go at all as you had hoped. You find yourself walking back up the hill the following morning, alone and on an empty stomach. You need to wash away a
      sleepless night with fresh air, but you must hurry as you need to head back home much sooner than expected because of serious problems at work. You feel the first annoying heat in your nostrils
      of a cold coming on. Your muscles are stiff from the day before and one calf muscle feels torn. You reach the same spot and pause. Take in the view before you. How little could you care for the
      detail? Turn away from the sun and its irritating cheer.</p>
