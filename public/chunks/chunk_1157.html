        <h2>SECOND READING</h2>
<p>At its most basic, charity means giving someone something they need but can’t get for themselves. Normally this is understood to mean something material. We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money. But, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about the interpretation of motives. It involves seeing that another person’s bad behaviour is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is a result of suffering. The psychologically charitable feel inwardly ‘fortunate’ enough to be able to come forward with explanations of others’ misdeeds – their impatience or over-ambition, rashness or rage – that take attenuating circumstances into account. They generate a picture of who another person might be that can make them seem more than simply mean or mad. In financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but they normally stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in our relationships with others more broadly, the need for charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided, for we all stand in need of constant and shifting generosity of interpretation.</p>
<p>We are never far from requiring help in explaining to the world why we are not quite as awful as we seem.</p>
<p>Small children sometimes behave in stunningly unfair and shocking ways: they scream at the person who is looking after them, angrily push away a bowl of animal pasta, throw away something you have just fetched for them. But we rarely feel personally agitated or wounded by their behaviour. And the reason is that we don’t assign a negative motive or mean intention to a small person. We reach around for the most benevolent interpretations. We don’t think they are doing it in order to upset us. We probably think that they are a bit tired, or their gums are sore, or they are upset by the arrival of a younger sibling. We have a large repertoire of alternative explanations ready in our heads – and none of these lead us to panic or get terribly agitated.</p>
<p>This is the reverse of what tends to happen around adults in general, and our lovers in particular. Here we imagine that others deliberately have us in their sights. They probably relish the thought of causing us distress. But if we employed the infant model of interpretation, our first assumption would be quite different: maybe they didn’t sleep well last night and are too exhausted to think straight; maybe they have a sore knee; maybe they are doing the equivalent of testing the boundaries of parental tolerance.</p>
<p>It’s very touching that we live in a world where we have learnt to be so kind to children: now we must learn to be a little more charitable towards the childlike parts of one another.</p>
