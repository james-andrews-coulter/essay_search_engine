        <h2>HOUSEHOLD TASKS</h2>
<p>A traditional approach to mental healing stresses the need to face up to our demons—at all times and with full courage. The underlying idea is that we fall ill when we attempt to back away from certain painful but necessary truths about our inner lives: that we are in a very unhappy relationship, that we were traumatized in childhood, that we are addicted to a substance, or have not dared to do justice to our sexuality. We will only get well, so the theory goes, once we cease to crowd out our own reality; the glare of honesty will save us.</p>
<p>But while we can amply recognize the toll of certain forms of denial, we can still make a nuanced case for the other side, for the occasional need—especially when we are very unwell—to take some time off from self-analysis. We should do so not in a spirit of escape but rather from a feeling of consciously giving ourselves a few hours away from our problems so that we can return to them with renewed creativity and strength. Distraction intelligently handled can be a part of mental healing.</p>
<p>We might therefore want to recommend that the mentally fragile make soup or freeze batches of pasta sauces; weed the garden and seed flowers for the spring; scour the internet for new kinds of peripherals for the computer; ensure that the stairs are spotless and the windows free of all finger marks; or invest in a strange kind of sanding machine with which to finally sort out the door that doesn’t close properly.</p>
<p>Of course it’s important to talk about key figures of childhood and try to trace the origins of our fears of disgrace. But it could be equally important at other moments to run away from the incessant pain inside us by making fishcakes or raking the garden.</p>
<p>Small household tasks offer us a metaphor for the sort of fixing we’re interested in but can’t yet quite manage inside ourselves. They give us the courage to imagine a day when we might be as tidy inside our minds as the linen cupboard outside currently is—thanks to what we did all afternoon.</p>
<p>There is kindness in making sure a mentally unwell person has a few untaxing duties to take care of every day. Monasteries understood the unruliness of the mind and the kindly role of chores in assuaging it. They allowed the monks to think head on of God and their responsibilities within a spiritual life for many hours at a time. But they also gave them moments to think of something that was simpler and more exhausting. Hence the emphasis on working in the vegetable garden and the kitchen, the laundry room, and the pantry.</p>
<p>It can be the height of generosity to ask someone who isn’t well to help us change the sheets and prune the artichokes. It won’t be work; it is in reality a minor vacation from the exhausting labors that must soon resume within.</p>
