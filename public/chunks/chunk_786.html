        <h3>7. Purity vs Ambivalence</h3>
<p>The Romantic is drawn to either wholehearted endorsement or total rejection. Ideally, partners should love everything about each other – or break up. The Romantic is dismayed by compromise. In a domestic argument it is very important for the Romantic to feel they are right; actually resolving an issue in collaboration with their partner doesn’t excite them to the same degree.</p>
<p>The Classical person takes the view that very few things, and no people (especially themselves or their partner), are either wholly good or entirely bad. They assume that there is likely to be some worth in opposing ideas and something to be learned from both sides. It is Classical to think that your partner, though overall very nice, might in certain areas hold views you find deeply unpalatable and a little absurd.</p>
<p>Both Romantic and Classical orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other. But because a good relationship requires a judicious balance of both, at this point in history, it might be the Classical attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently. It is a mode of approaching life which is ripe for rediscovery.</p>
