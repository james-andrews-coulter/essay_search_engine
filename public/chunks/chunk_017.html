        <h3>4. The fear of having nothing interesting to say</h3>
<p>We are often held back in social life by a feeling that we can have nothing very interesting to say – chiefly because nothing especially dramatic ever happens to us. We may have a quite ordinary job; we seldom travel; the outward circumstances of our lives are settled. On this basis, we can end up assuming that we won’t especially be able to intrigue or delight anyone, and so we may fall rapidly silent in interactions.</p>
<p>What this unfortunate line misses is that there is no such thing as a boring life, only a life that has been unfairly interpreted and narrated, perhaps by its owner. The clearest evidence for this is the extent to which some of the greatest works of art – they might be paintings and novels, films or comedy shows – are woven out of everyday, undramatic cloth. They involve nothing grander than ordinary men and women stumbling through daily realities – but these become promptly fascinating (funny or intellectually deep, beautiful or moving) because they have been presented to us with special receptivity and insight. The works of Vermeer and Jane Austen, Larry David and Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and Lady Murasaki (to cite just a few examples) are resolutely fashioned out of so-called ‘ordinary material’. There are no great military exploits; no one is especially distinguished or legendary; nothing much ‘happens’. And yet the works of art that result are some of the most compelling that have ever been made – proof that what makes a life gripping is not so much what objectively occurs in it as the way in which it is explored and told. The most seemingly ordinary event – a daydream at the window, an interaction with a child, a walk in the park – can become a topic of hilarity or majesty when it is handled with due respect and imagination. Our lives are already as interesting as we ever need them to be, so long as we can accurately honour their true contents.</p>
<p>The American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked: ‘In the minds of geniuses, we find – once more – our own neglected thoughts.’ In other words, geniuses don’t have thoughts that are in the end so very different from our own; they have simply had the confidence to take them more seriously. Rather than imagining that their minds are only a pale shadow of the minds of infinitely greater thinkers who lived and died elsewhere long ago, they have been respectful enough of their existence to conceive that one or two properly valuable or vivid ideas might plausibly choose to alight in the familiar aviary of their own intelligences. Thinking is – in a way we generally refuse to imagine – a truly democratic activity. We all have very similar and very able minds; where so-called ‘interesting’ people differ is in their more confident inclinations to study them properly.</p>
<p>Every life – our own included – is, properly understood, immensely complex and moving. We read, we think, we observe, we have an intricate emotional history; we love and hate and hope and fear. It cannot be true that we are essentially uninteresting. We only ever unfairly lose faith in our inalienable capacity to interest others.</p>

<li>The belief in simplicity</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the saving graces of relationships is that they are broadly understood to be very complicated things indeed. People appreciate that couples will constantly end up locked in disputes and tensions over apparently innocuous things – and may then need to spend an inordinate amount of time working their way through their differences, perhaps with the help of a psychotherapist or a mediator. It doesn’t surprise anyone when a couple has a major stand-off because of the way one of them does (or doesn’t do) the washing-up, or says the word ‘please’, or behaved around their aunt at supper. Wearily, we understand that living with a partner is an awesomely intricate business and – on a good day – we are willing to give this intricacy the respect and the time it requires.</p>
<p>Friendship, on the other hand, can find us more optimistic, less guarded – and more blithe. We assume that, here, things will at last be relatively easy, largely on the basis that – quite often, for a while – they indeed are. Friendships are meant to be the generous, kind and fun part of life. We come here with an expectation of ease and emotionally unburdened interactions. Not for friends the ponderous self-absorption and obsessiveness that we know from couples.</p>
<p>Except – of course – it rarely works out entirely this way, paradoxically, especially in those friendships that are particularly valuable and worth preserving. The more a friendship deepens, the more likely we are to stumble upon many of the same issues that complicate relationships. But here, unlike in love, we are bereft of an ideology that can render us appropriately patient and respectful of the shoals we’ve hit. We’re fatefully convinced that we need to be breezy and light precisely where – now – we should allow ourselves to be cautious, compassionate and committed to painstaking exploration. We wind up torn between an impulse to have our case heard and an impression that we surely shouldn’t be so ‘heavy’ in this arena.</p>
<p>We should not make our lives more complicated than they need to be by insisting on an illusory simplicity. The human mind is one of the most sensitive – and easily bruised – organs in the cosmos. In the course of our social lives, however serious and apparently dignified we are, we are likely to be impacted by some of the following:</p>
<p>• A friend who, at the end of messages, is uninclined to end matters with the ‘xx’ we privately expect and always give them.</p>
<p>• A friend who never asks about our health, though we always remember to address the kidney issue or backache they mentioned to us last year.</p>
<p>• A friend who insists on meeting on Tuesdays though they know that Thursdays are marginally easier for us.</p>
<p>• A friend who keeps alluding – in a quiet but significant way – to the wealth differential between us.</p>
<p>Our belief in the ‘ease’ of friendship contains a hidden fragility: unlike in love, we feel we are not allowed to scream across the room and tell a friend they’ve betrayed us. We can’t, like an ardent partner, say that we hate them right now and want out. We can’t – most significantly of all – dissolve our frustrations in generous and passionate acts of love-making.</p>
<p>In the worst case, we end up having to walk away from someone we are fond of because we’re unable to tell them that – for a time at least, in order subsequently to recover sincere affection – we need to hate them quite a lot. The alluring idea that friends should never criticise one another ends up undermining the very friendships we most value.</p>
<p>We need to remove the pressure on individual friendships to be devoid of tensions. We should conduct all our friendships under a general, socially endorsed notion that – naturally – the more we get to know someone, the more issues will crop up. The more there will be resentments and points of contention and the more we will need to rely on artificial-sounding resolution mechanisms to dispel grievances without either side being made to feel that something has gone irrevocably wrong.</p>
<p>One suggestion is that – without anything significant being understood by this – good friends should regularly air between them the question: ‘Tell me, what have I recently done to annoy you?’ Significantly, the enquiry shouldn’t probe whether or not one has annoyed the friend; the starting assumption – far less pejoratively – is that naturally one has done so (because every good friend does) and one simply needs to know the details.</p>
<p>With good cheer and an absence of paranoia or despair, one might point out to a friend that one was a little irked by a recent email; the friend might then respond by recounting a sensitivity raised by one’s attitude to time-keeping or to boasting about one’s promotion. Each person would welcome a complaint as evidence that their friend was taking their connection seriously; an inability to come up with any offence might seem like a sign that one was either being dishonestly sentimental or didn’t like one’s friend enough to acknowledge their power to perturb one.</p>
<p>We start to properly value our friendships when we grant that they are often every bit as tricky – and every bit as worthy of being rescued through analysis and discussion – as our most meaningful love stories.</p>
