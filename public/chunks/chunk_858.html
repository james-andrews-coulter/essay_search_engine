        <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p>Arguing in relationships is, privately, so familiar to us that it can feel like a constant of the human condition. But there is a significant historical dimension to our propensity to fight and our style of doing so. We should investigate the history and future of arguments.</p>
<p>Cairo, Egypt, 1550 BC</p>
<p>Couples in Ancient Egypt are no strangers to frustrations, but the way in which these are handled reflect assumptions that will appear standard all around the world before the modern period. Far from engaging in lengthy or passionate discussion, husbands are encouraged to shut down conflict through dogmatic command and, at points, physical force. A statute from the time recommends that a wife who disagrees with her husband should be sequestered in a pit or a large earthenware jar for a time in order to restore harmony to the household.</p>
<p>Athens, Greece, 415 BC</p>
<p>The philosopher Socrates develops a reputation for being highly unusual in his way of life, not least because he is known to have many long and often contentious discussions with his wife, Xanthippe. When asked why a wise man couldn’t simply render his wife obedient through brute authority, Socrates replies that conflictual conversation with a spouse will provide a philosopher with a vital education in the arts of persuasion and dialogue. The answer sounds highly weird to its first audiences.</p>
<p>London, England, February 1542</p>
<p>Henry VIII of England and his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, are in marital difficulties. Catherine is rumoured to have been conducting an affair with a courtier who is also her private secretary – and Henry is furious. But rather than argue about this, he simply issues orders to have Catherine beheaded outside the Tower of London. From the scaffold, she makes a short speech in which she describes her punishment as ‘worthy and just’.</p>
<p>Paris, France, October 1833</p>
<p>The English philosopher John Stuart Mill and the feminist author Harriet Taylor meet in a small Left Bank hotel and begin a love affair guided by a radically new set of ideas about how relationships between men and women might go. Both Mill and Taylor are committed to what becomes known as companionable love, a relationship marked by mutual respect and friendship, and to even-tempered dialogue as the way to resolve tensions. Taylor will later compliment Mill by saying that he was one of the only men she had ever met who knew how to speak to a woman as if she might be as intelligent as he was.</p>
<p>But however noble the sentiments, most couples do not manage to emulate Taylor and Mill’s unusually dignified relationship. Indeed, the principles of modern marriage manage, paradoxically, to radically increase opportunities for protracted conflict and complex disagreement. These relationships require two people to undertake a huge range of tasks – wholly in common and with thorough mutual consent – that in the past would have been split into exclusive and discussion-free spheres. They must now jointly reach decisions on what kind of rug might be nice for the parlour, what to do on Sunday afternoon, whose parents to have Christmas with, where to send a child to school, how to serve soup and how much weight either of them might lose.</p>
<p>Relationships come to be guided by a Romantic vision of harmonised souls. People don’t merely want the reluctant acquiescence of a partner; they want them spontaneously to respond to the world in exactly the same way as they do, to share their sense of humour, to like a novel for the same reasons, to participate enthusiastically in the intricacies of their erotic imagination, to be aligned with their economic attitudes and to agree with them about interior design and the right time to go to bed. Unsurprisingly, divorce rates begin a long and sharp rise upwards.</p>
<p>New York, United States, 1935</p>
<p>Married physicians Hannah and Abraham Stone begin to offer relationship counselling to distressed couples who find themselves unable to communicate effectively. They condense many of their learnings into a bestselling book, A Marriage Manual, which, among other pieces of advice, recommends that couples learn not to utter dogmatic negative assertions about what their partner is ‘really’ like and stick instead to explaining how the other makes them feel. We will make much more progress by saying, for example, ‘You make me feel as if I don’t matter to you in any way’ rather than resorting to a more global and defining, ‘You are a selfish and uncaring brute.’</p>
<p>Messenia, Greece, August 2013</p>
<p>Actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy star in Richard Linklater’s film Before Midnight, a study of a couple in crisis. The film becomes famous for a twenty-minute argument scene set in a Greek hotel, one of the longest and most fiery disputes in modern cinema, during which Hawke and Delpy trade insults, shout, slam doors and seethe with awesome cold fury at one another. The fractiousness on screen displays, with rare honesty, what a great many couples around the world know only too well from their own lives. People may in theory be committed to companionable marriage and civilised dialogue, but most of them still have little idea how to enact their loftier aspirations.</p>
<p>Intergalactic Space Station, somewhere near Jupiter, 2200</p>
<p>Couples continue to face many of the same challenges as they did in the era of arguments that began in the 19th century. They still have to make tricky joint decisions (about when to hail a rocket or to download their brain) and they still seek to convey the subtle truths of their feelings, desires, fears and needs, but they don’t now get enraged or snide, and they don’t shout or slam space station doors. They feel agitation, but they deal with it via techniques of therapeutic diplomacy taught to them over long years of schooling and regularly refreshed via their embedded mind-chips. They have been taught how arguments start, how to drain them of their force, how deftly to transmit important truths and how to strive to see a situation through another’s eyes. There is a good deal less desperation and a lot less swearing in our gravity-less robot-vacuumed homes.</p>
<p>For most of human history, couples haven’t fought: One person has simply asserted their will and shut the other person down. Now we are living in a far more hopeful age that trusts in equality and dialogue. And yet we have only taken the first steps towards knowing how to handle disagreement and conflict in mature and intelligent ways. We have learnt how to hope for love in our relationships; the task ahead of us is to cope more wisely and resourcefully with the moments of hate.</p>
