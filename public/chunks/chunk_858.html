        <h2>Confidence in One’s Weirdness</h2>
<p>One of the secret obstacles to forming a good relationship lies in the strength of our longing to appear normal.</p>
<p>This is particularly evident in the early days of love, when – over dinner – we explain what we are like and, without any obvious wish to deceive, present ourselves as substantially normal, free of unusual or burdensome habits, without distinctive and powerful appetites – simply a reliable, kind, healthy, optimistic and wholly unalarming Everyman or -woman.</p>
<p>The impulse to clean up our natures is easy to understand. We are, after all, attempting to ensure that our isolation will come to an end. But the costs of our airbrushing tend, over time, to be immensely high. In the course of moulding ourselves into a shape we think will appeal, we sacrifice multiple aspects of our reality that will not ultimately let themselves be easily forgotten and that will complain at our attempts to repress them by unleashing symptoms, twitches and compensatory cravings. We cannot faithfully ignore the self that wakes up a little after 4 a.m. every morning in a panic, that eats too much to escape a sense of sorrow, that is interested in certain byways of sex, that is terrified of entering a room of strangers, that is uncommonly alarmed by features of their career and that is intermittently sure of dying broke, disgraced and alone.</p>
<p>The paradox of love is that we both desperately long to be known and fear that we will be rejected if we ever are so. The way out of our furtiveness is to come to a more reasonable view of what is, despite appearances, likely to be happening in other people’s minds as well. We cannot – considered logically – have been formed in the utterly unique ways we fear on a planet of nearly 8 billion souls. Much that we consider to be wholly abnormal in ourselves must have counterparts in others, even those who insist on presenting themselves as respectable and unblemished. The terrors, the appetites, the weaknesses, the idiocies – these cannot be our burdens alone, and we can dare to believe that they must exist somewhere within the mind of the ostensibly reasonable person seated opposite us at an early dinner.</p>
<p>With a background confidence in the universality of strangeness, we should take steps to share some of the following ideas early on in our unions, so as not to have to collide into them awkwardly down the line. We should tell our companions that:</p>
<p>We are scared</p>
<p>As everyone is, about pretty much everything. Life is an alarming business for well-founded reasons. A blood clot could mean that we are dead by nightfall; an economic downturn could wipe out every one of our advantages; a rumour could destroy our name.</p>
<p>We are emotionally scarred</p>
<p>None of us came through childhood unharmed. We have all – in response to the odd characters we encountered there – taken on peculiar defences and modes of being that render us overly aggressive or under-confident, chaotic or rigid, preoccupied or thoughtless. A ‘normal’ person has yet to be born.</p>
<p>We are not as grown up as we seem</p>
<p>The child in us lives on and is neither necessarily charming nor benevolent. They have tantrums; they sulk rather than explain; they want to be rescued but may bite those who try to do so. Very often, they simply feel sorry for themselves. It’s touching – almost.</p>
<p>We are sexually unlike what we are ‘meant’ to be</p>
<p>Every era bequeaths its participants with a script about what normal sexuality looks like and demands. Every era thereby compels its members to lie or feel intensely ashamed about a lot of who they are. We are no exception. We know what – despite the apparently ‘liberated’ atmosphere we breathe – we have never dared to tell anyone. The risk of being thought a sinner or a pervert hounds us every bit as much as it would one of our medieval ancestors cowering guiltily from the prohibitions of a severe priest or imam.</p>
<p>Our dinner companions might be tempted to run, but they should – in response to our candour – be uncommonly interested in staying, given the extent to which relationships are reinforced by mutual authenticity.</p>
<p>In the deeper intimacy of coupledom, our oddities are either going to leak out (to potentially disastrous effect), or the burden of lying about who we are will eventually suffocate our capacity to feel. It is of course painful to list the sorts of things that make us afraid of being too odd to be loved, but there is so much strangeness all around, our quirks are likely to be the rule rather than the exception. A brief survey of curious cases would include a 32-year-old who sucks their thumb; an airline pilot who wants to be breastfed; a professional soccer player who writes poetry; an ambitious male politician who wears dresses; an apparently confident brain surgeon who is terrified of going into shops; someone successful who, with half their mind, is sure they are about to fail; or a rather nice-looking person who has to vomit every time they catch their reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>We know that ‘oddness’ is systematically under-reported on the basis of one central fact: to date, we have seldom told anyone the truth about who we are. We believe others are normal and, to return the punishment, we force them to think we might be normal as well. We will finally allow ourselves to be properly warmed by one another’s love when we can grow bold enough to escape the prison of our needlessly respectable self-presentations.</p>
