        <h2>A SUPPORT NETWORK</h2>
<p>A decent social life isn’t, for the mentally fragile, a luxury or a form of entertainment. It is a resource to help us to stay alive. We need people to balance our minds when we are slipping. We need friends who will soothe our fears and not accuse us of self-indulgence or self-pity for the amount of time our illness has sequestered. It will help immensely if they have struggles of their own and if we can therefore meet as equal fellow ailing humans, as opposed to hierarchically separated doctors and patients. We’ll need ruthlessness in expunging certain other people from our diaries: people who harbor secret resentments against us, who are latently hostile to self-examination, who are scared of their own minds and project their fears on to us. A few hours with such types can throw a shadow over a whole day, as their unsympathetic voices become lodged in our minds and feed our own ample stores of self-doubt. We shouldn’t hesitate to socially edit our lives in order to endure.</p>
