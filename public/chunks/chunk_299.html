        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since the middle of the eighteenth century, beginning in Northern Europe and then spreading to every corner of the world, people have become aware of living in an age radically different from any other. With a mixture of awe and respect, trepidation and nostalgia, they have called this ‘the modern age’ or, more succinctly, ‘modernity’. We are now all inhabitants of modernity; every last hamlet and remote island has been touched by the outlook and ideology of a new era.</p>
<p>The story of our emergence into the modern world can be traced in politics, religion, technology, fashion, science, art — all of which have contributed to an alteration in consciousness, to a change in the way we think and feel. Becoming modern has involved changes across many parts of our lives.</p>
