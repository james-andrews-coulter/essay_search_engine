        <h4>5. How to Keep a Home</h4>
<p>Welcome to domestic bliss.</p>
<p>My Saturday mornings</p>
<p>Joan Rivers put it best: ‘I hate housework! You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again.’1 I know what she means.</p>
<p>So far, this book has asked you to think about how to build a home, how to arrange the furniture that it contains, how to decorate it, and how to collect the objects that will fill it. Do all of
  those things, you might be forgiven for thinking, and you have made yourself a home. Your work, you might imagine, is done.</p>
<p>Your work is just beginning; and the beds and dishes are just the tip of the iceberg. There’s the drying up, too, and the putting it all away. Then there’s all that wiping down,
  hoovering, dusting and polishing. There’s the cleaning out the back of the fridge, and the scrubbing down the inside of the oven. There’s window cleaning to do; and there’s the
  perennial decluttering and rearranging.</p>
<p>And then there’s redecorating, repainting and replastering ceilings and walls, sometimes knocking them down, or building new ones. There are repairs to roofs after storms or snow,
  rewiring, replumbing, and the plugging of leaks. There’s the mortgage to be rearranged, or the phone, TV or Wi-Fi contract to be sorted or the council tax to be paid (all of which seem to
  involve interminable hours on the telephone).</p>
<p>And we haven’t even started on the garden.</p>
<p>You will not be paid for undertaking any of this work, and it will not contribute to your continuing personal and professional development. It will not end up on your curriculum vitae or lead to
  a promotion. And what is more, this work will be endless and, unless you are consigned to a care home, or have the means to live in an hotel, it will haunt you until the end of your days, becoming
  more and more difficult with every year.</p>
<p>As Miss Rivers observed, this work will never be finished. Do the washing up, and you know that, six months later, you will have to do it all over again. Hoover the floor and the fluff will
  reappear in seconds. Wipe the surfaces and someone will spill something on them in moments. The fridge will continue to go mouldy, and the oven greasy for as long as you use them. Clean the
  windows, and the dirty rain will fall on them the next day. Roofs will leak, walls will always need to be repainted, and the garden will keep on growing in all sorts of ways you never imagined.</p>
<p>And all these hours of unpaid work will be undertaken in your downtime. For me, it’s Saturday mornings, when I should be lying in bed with a hangover. And what’s worse is that all of
  it, all of this work that I shouldn’t have to be doing, is taking place in the one place I shouldn’t have to be doing work at all: in fact, the one place I come to in order to get away
  from work. It is taking place at home.</p>
<p>Separate spheres?</p>
<p>It wasn’t always so. Before the nineteenth century, work wasn’t something you went to (or came home from). Work was what, and who, you were. Being a king, or priest,
  or merchant or a peasant weren’t jobs: they were rungs on the great ladder of being, castes, estates that governed who you could marry, what you could wear, where you could go, whether you
  could read, or eat.</p>
<p>And where you could live, for the places in which people lived and worked were one and the same. Castles or palaces weren’t the places to which a prince returned after a hard day princing
  somewhere else: they were the manifestation of his status, and, in the case of castles, the very real guarantee of his own personal security and power. You weren’t a monk unless you lived in
  a monastery; and merchants lived above the shop. In Renaissance Florence, banking families like the Medici and Strozzi and Pazzi lived, literally, on top of the money deposited in their banks. The
  houses of seventeenth-century Amsterdam were essentially habitable warehouses, supplied by the network of canals that linked them to the seaborne empire beyond. In cottages everywhere, peasant
  families have always lived with their livestock and their agricultural implements. There is no fairytale in which some goodwife is not hard at work stirring pottage or porridge, spinning by the
  fire, sweeping the grate, cleaning the table, or milking the cow.</p>
<p>But in the nineteenth century, with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, work began to become something that took place outside the home. For the governing classes, it was concentrated in
  ministries and chancellories; for the bourgeoisie in offices and exchanges; for the proletariat the peasantry had become, in the factory, the plantation, and the mine. Cities themselves divided in
  two: into ‘downtown’, the ‘CBD’, or the bazaar, in which work was meant to happen; and the suburbs or cantonments, with their villas, lawns, and tennis clubs, from which
  work was apparently entirely absent.</p>
<p>And homes began to divide, too. Once upon a time, home had been a hall, a single room in which all of life, work and play had been promiscuously mixed; but in the nineteenth century new rooms
  were invented: parlours for talking in, drawing rooms for withdrawing to, sitting rooms for sitting in, playrooms for playing in. The kitchens and sculleries and laundries in which work was meant
  to happen were hidden out of sight in basements, or out the back.</p>
<p>All those drawing rooms and parlours were decorated by women for women, to sit and talk in while their men were at work, earning the money to pay for them. That’s certainly what Charles
  Eastlake thought as he addressed his Hints on Household Taste to the wives of the bourgeoisie, or Elsie de Wolfe instructed them about successful dining. The division of cities, buildings
  and rooms into separate spheres marked a division between the genders;2 and the world had been divided in two: between those who worked, and those who
  didn’t.</p>
<p>A woman’s work is never done</p>
<p>Pay those ladies a call, however, ask them what they were up to, and you might have been given a very different picture.</p>
<p>No one bears better witness to just how much labour the nineteenth-century home could actually be for women than Mrs Beeton. Her famous Book of Household Management was, like Hints
  on Household Taste, addressed to aspirational Victorian housewives; but while Eastlake imagined well-bred ladies following fashion at their leisure, Mrs Beeton saw them hard at work.</p>
<p>Being a housewife meant being up before anyone else (with, naturally, a cold or tepid bath for the health), stoking the range and preparing breakfast, mending clothes in the morning before
  making social calls of no more than fifteen minutes at a time before lunch, managing servants, attending to the health of children, organizing entertainments for the evening, and, when everyone
  else had gone to bed, getting down to work, breaking lump sugar, stoning raisins, washing and drying currants:</p>
<p>The evening, too, is the best time for setting right her account for the expenditure and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid and also for making memoranda
      of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments.3</p>
<p>If it makes the housewife sound a little like a businesswoman as well as a skivvy, then that was entirely deliberate. The injunction with which Mrs Beeton begins her book is
  chilling: ‘As with the commander of an army,’ she wrote, ‘or the leader of any enterprise, so is it with the mistress of a house.’4</p>
<p>Social visits formed part of a currency: ‘A strict account,’ she wrote, should be kept of ceremonial visits, and notice how soon your visits have been returned.’5 Even solitary leisure was subjected to the laws of progress and productivity: ‘intended to the mind,’ she enjoined, ‘as whetting is to the
  scythe to sharpen the edge of it, which would otherwise grow dull and blunt.’6</p>
<p>Mrs Beeton’s Book of Household Management is an account against which ideas of the home as a refuge from the world of work starts to look like a rather partial view, written by
  men who never had to do any housework, wealthy enough to be unable to imagine that their womenfolk wouldn’t have servants to do their housework for them.</p>
<p>But home wasn’t a refuge from work for most women, it was work. What is more, subjected as it was by a Mrs Beeton to minute accountancy, strict time management, and rigid
  standards of quality control, it wasn’t so different from all those jobs in the office or the factory or the ministry after all.</p>
<p>The domestic industrial revolution</p>
<p>Mrs Beeton imagined the home not as a refuge from the factory, but as a sort of factory in itself, churning out endless meals, clothes, social occasions, comforts, children and
  all the rest of it. Since that time, the home has been subjected to the same processes of mechanization as the world of work. In Mrs Beeton’s day that factory might have been crowded by
  washerwomen, scullery maids, cooks, and messenger boys. A century and a half later, they have been replaced by washing machines, dishwashers, and microwaves. Your kitchen, and mine, are among the
  most heavily technologized spaces on the planet.</p>
<p>It’s a revolution that has taken place over a century of struggle between the sexes. Take something innocent sounding, for example: the ‘kitchen triangle’: the pattern made as
  you move between fridge, sink, and cooker while you’re cooking. Speak to anyone in a kitchen showroom and they’ll tell you it should be as small as possible. It’s conventional
  wisdom, now.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t always been. The kitchen triangle is the result of the same sort of ergonomic studies that drive the design of cars in factories, or the extraction of bauxite from mines. The
  time-and-motion study techniques used by Henry Ford, for example, were used in the 1920s by designers like Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, working on social housing in Frankfurt.
  Schütte-Lihotzky proudly claimed she’d never cooked a meal in her life, but she spent weeks watching what other women did in the kitchen as they prepared dinner for their families.</p>
<p>She did it to set them free; and many feminists of her time, borrowing insights from the processes of mass production, campaigned to have housework outsourced from the home. They proposed mass
  dining clubs, kindergartens, public laundries and washing facilities where they could leave the duties of the home and go out, like their menfolk, to earn money. Occasionally their revolutionary
  campaigns bore fruit in reality, especially in the fervid atmosphere of Russia in the 1920s. The Narkomfin apartment building in Moscow, for example, was designed as a revolutionary ‘social
  condenser’, with communal kitchens on the ground floor completely separate from fifty-four sleeping units upstairs.</p>
<p>Just like men before them, women were convinced that the machine would set them free. In 1912 Christine Frederick, a housewife herself, campaigned for a ‘new
  housekeeping’7 in homes designed on industrial principles:</p>
<p>I turned eagerly to my husband. ‘George,’ said I, ‘that efficiency gospel is going to mean a lot to modern housekeeping, in spite of the doubts I have. Do
      you know I am going to work out those principles here in our home! I won’t have you men doing all the great and noble things! I’m going to find out how those experts conduct
      investigations, and all about it, and then apply it to my factory, my business, my home.’8</p>
<p>But is housework work?</p>
<p>Home isn’t the opposite of work; and it never has been. There is, however, one fundamental difference between the work that takes place at home and the work that takes
  place outside it. Housework isn’t paid work.</p>
<p>In 1972, the activist Selma James launched the international campaign ‘Wages for Housework’. The problem that vexed James wasn’t money per se, or the lack of independence
  caused by its absence, or even the men who imposed this drudgery on ‘their’ women. It was that housework was, quite simply, not understood as work. Interviewed recently in the
  Guardian, James says:</p>
<p>By demanding payment for housework we attack what is terrible about caring in our capitalist society, while protecting what is great about it, and what it could be. We
      refuse housework, because we think everyone should be doing it.9</p>
<p>For quite aside from the very real consequences of not getting paid for work – slavery and poverty and low status – the strange nature of housework raised another
  question: if it wasn’t paid work, then what sort of work was it?</p>
<p>The problem is that however much we try to technologize it, monetize it, politicize it, or account for it – however hard we work at making it work – housework just doesn’t seem
  to conform to capitalist (or Marxist) models of labour. That is, it is not a trade-off between time or effort, and money. It can’t be. Even Selma James admitted that ‘this work is not
  like other work: we hate it, and we want to do it’.10</p>
<p>In fact, housework may be more similar to those types of work that predated the Industrial Revolution. When the sociologist Paul J. J. Pennartz asked one of his interviewees, a Dutch housewife,
  why she couldn’t leave the washing up undone before sitting down to dinner, she replied:</p>
<p>I get nervous while eating, I can’t stand it . . . I like to relax while I am eating, I don’t taste the food when everything is in a mess . . . because I feel
      haunted by the work waiting for me.11</p>
<p>We might all confess to being haunted by work, or internalizing its demands and strictures, but at least we get to come home from it. For housewives, however, there is no going
  home. They are there already; and they are at work all the time. Rather like the prince or the priest or the merchant or the peasant of the olden days, they are their work.</p>
<p>There’s something else that’s particularly unmodern about housework, and the people who do it. It’s something Joan Rivers was thinking about when she complained about doing the
  dishes: the trouble with housework isn’t just that you have to do it, it’s that you have to do it over and over again. Most housework isn’t about improving things. It’s the
  endless, thankless, repetitive drudgery of keeping them pretty much the same.</p>
<p>What does the Industrial Revolution look like when it’s at home?</p>
<p>And that is not something we are trained to value. The modern conception of the ‘career’ is deeply wedded to the idea of progress. Teachers hope their pupils will advance through
  school, businessmen that their businesses will grow, farmers that their crops will multiply, doctors that new diseases will be cured, and administrators that quality will be enhanced as well as
  assured. When did you last hear anyone at work sing the praises of keeping things as they are?</p>
<p>Whether you’re a Marxist or a neoliberal, a biological evolutionist or a born-again Christian, history is told as a story of improvement – technological, social, scientific, moral
  – from slavery to Communism or the victory of the markets, from the amoeba to Superman, from analogue to digital, Creation to the Rapture. Modernity itself is an idea based on the assumption
  that time moves forward, and that things get better.</p>
<p>But when it comes to fixing leaks or taking the bins out it doesn’t feel like we are moving forward. At home, the progressive law of materialist dialectics is well and truly cancelled out
  by the rather less thrilling second law of thermodynamics. Making a home isn’t really about making things better. It’s more about stopping them getting worse. No wonder we all try to
  get out of it.</p>
<p>Drudgerie divine</p>
<p>But perhaps we shouldn’t. After all, that dirty kitchen floor isn’t going to mop itself. Mrs Beeton was adamant that housework lent real value to the woman who
  undertook it:</p>
<p>She ought always to remember that she is the first and the last, the alpha and the omega in the whole government of her establishment, that it is by her conduct that its
      whole internal policy is regulated. She is, therefore, a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is.12</p>
<p>But housework is not just about status. It is worth considering, for an (unpaid) moment, that there are some things worth doing even if we aren’t given money for doing
  them.</p>
<p>Paul Pennartz’s sociological investigations of the home led him to some unexpected conclusions about the value of housework. His study started by asking participants ‘When is it most
  pleasant at home?’ and, not unexpectedly, people cited times like getting in from work, or sleeping in on Sunday morning, or sitting in front of the telly, or around the dinner table: times
  that involved being together with nearest and dearest, at leisure.</p>
<p>But when he asked the question ‘When is it least pleasant at home?’ he didn’t get the converse answer. One mother and housewife reacted by saying:</p>
<p>Some days I’m depressed . . . I think in the afternoon . . . because in the morning I’m busy with housework . . . But in the afternoon, yes, for a few hours . .
      . from about one to four o’clock . . . at three o’clock I start cooking again.13</p>
<p>It wasn’t being busy with housework in the morning she found depressing, but the aimless afternoon, with no work to do. Given the option of lying on the sofa, undisturbed,
  eating chocolates, she’d rather not. Which suggests that there are other definitions of work, and its value, than the old capitalist or Marxist one of the selling of time, attention and
  effort for money.</p>
<p>I currently have a student, Kate Lampitt Adey, who is interviewing women who knit in their leisure time.14 They don’t do it because they
  expect to make money, they tell her, or because they want to make great works of textile art. These women aren’t professional craftspeople or politicized yarn-bombers, who cover public
  monuments in their knitting as a form of feminist protest. Quite simply, they can’t stand having idle hands; and they like making things for the sake of making them. Some of them enjoy the
  process of making things so much that they often unravel what they have made so that they can make it all over again.</p>
<p>Kate compares this sort of knitting to ‘serious leisure’. It’s a concept coined in 1992 by the sociologist Robert Stebbins, who studied how we often turn the activities we
  undertake in our free time into a sort of challenge or work, be it learning how to play a musical instrument or to ski, or building muscles in the gym. Like housework, or knitting, such activities
  aren’t motivated by the prospect of payment but are things – sometimes difficult and exhausting things – we undertake for their own sake.</p>
<p>Serious leisure activities can be an expensive and difficult business. They are often what we take time off work to do: to visit historic sites, dutifully photographing the monuments; to go to
  foreign countries to wander round the art galleries, ticking off the local delicacies or even to lie on a beach working on the tan; to visit the health spa to lose, or learn to lift, a
  specified weight. All too often, in what we define as our leisure time, we subject ourselves to the same rules of measurement, productivity and progress as we do in our hours of wage-slavery. But
  at least we might learn something, or lose a pound or two, or get better at skiing or playing an instrument, or knitting. It would be difficult to say the same about housework.</p>
<p>Now, Kate is interested in why the women she is interviewing are so reluctant to finish their knitting; and she’s realized that, rather than the product, it is the psychological state
  induced by the process of knitting that they really enjoy – what she calls ‘flow’.</p>
<p>Coined by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is a way of thinking about work that has nothing to do with money, or career, or status, or even, necessarily, producing anything very
  interesting. In fact, it’s not really about what you’re doing at all. It’s about the way you’re doing it. ‘The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement and
  thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz.’15</p>
<p>There are several criteria for the sort of work that can achieve flow: clear, attainable, but challenging physical goals, and apparently uninterrupted time. Flow is something we seek in all
  manner of the activities we might undertake in our leisure time, from running, or skiing, or sailing, to playing an instrument, or singing in a band, or meditating, or doing yoga.</p>
<p>All of them require concentration and energy, but don’t really rely on a result. ‘Flow’ activities are ones Csikszentmihalyi calls ‘autotelic’: that is, they serve
  no end other than themselves. You don’t do them for money, or promotion, or recognition, but because you have to.</p>
<p>Csikszentmihalyi was talking about composing symphonies, playing sport, performing in a jazz band, or meditation; but he could have been discussing doing the dishes. It, too, is an
  ‘autotelic’ activity that goes nowhere, produces, apparently, nothing new, and makes no money.</p>
<p>I’m not arguing that housework is intrinsically interesting (or that anything is), or occupies the same cultural status as playing jazz (although it’s considerably more important).
  Rather, I’m arguing that housework, repetitive and endless as it is, is something that could, with the right attitude, induce a state of flow.</p>
<p>I’m not really saying anything new. In seventeenth-century England, the Anglican vicar and poet George Herbert wrote a hymn we still sing today, that contains a curious verse:</p>
<p>All may of Thee partake:</p>
<p>Nothing can be so mean,</p>
<p>Which with his tincture – ‘for Thy sake’ –</p>
<p>Will not grow bright and clean.</p>
<p>A servant with this clause</p>
<p>Makes drudgerie divine:</p>
<p>Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws,</p>
<p>Makes that and th’ action fine.</p>
<p>This is the famous stone</p>
<p>That turneth all to gold;</p>
<p>For that which God doth touch and own</p>
<p>Cannot for less be told.16</p>
<p>We don’t value housework, but perhaps we should. It’s not something we’re going to be able to get out of doing any time soon.</p>
<p>Make time for mopping</p>
<p>When we talk about home as a refuge from the world, we often imagine the barricades we’ll need to build to defend it will be made of architecture, furniture, wallpaper,
  bibelots and so on. We’ve already seen how unreliable they can be.</p>
<p>Imagine if that barricade was made not of objects, and did not enclose a space.</p>
<p>Imagine if, instead, it was made of activities, and enclosed a time – a different sort of time to the one that is measured and alarmed on iPhones and laptops, paid for by the hour or the
  month, pegged against improved productivity targets, and tied to visions for enhancement. Imagine it enclosed a time where progress did not happen, in which nothing was paid for, and the minutes
  passed by unnoticed. Imagine it was a time of flow. Imagine if you could have that time without going anywhere or paying anyone. Imagine if you could make it your own for free.</p>
<p>It’s closer to home than you think. Housework creates nothing new, and leaves us back where we started. It creates time out of time. Making yourself at home does not come out of following
  fashions, accumulating more objects or better furniture, or making bigger buildings. It comes out of the act of keeping a home.</p>
<p>You asked me how to make yourself at home. Now, walk to the cupboard under the stairs, and take out that mop. Do it again tomorrow. You’re already there.</p>
