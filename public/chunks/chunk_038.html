            <h2>AN INTERNAL HUT</h2>
<p>We might, in order to escape modernity totally, seek to move to a hut somewhere far away. We would dwell amid nature with our own thoughts and, ideally, a circle of supportive friends. We would not need to be harried and pressured to conform to foreign ideals of success. But moving ourselves physically may not be necessary. What we may need is not so much an actual hut as a hut inside our own minds, one to which we can retreat when we know that we are being assailed by values that are inimical to our sense of balance and self-love. We may continue to wander through the modern world, to all intents and purposes just another obedient citizen of its value system, while internally highly suspicious of the messages we are receiving and committed to replacing them with ones imbued with far greater kindness and justice.</p>
<p>We can blame ourselves too much for our mental suffering. It is not that we are personally fragile but merely that we are living in a high-tech age that routinely smashes its more sensitive members to pieces through adherence to what will one day be recognized as a grossly primitive and unimaginative ethos.</p>
<p>8 Self-Compassion</p>
<p>If there is one generalization we can hazard about those who end up mentally unwell, we could say that they are masters at being very nasty to themselves.</p>
<p>The worst kind of nastiness doesn’t have to involve shouting at oneself or calling oneself an idiot, though this might happen too. It means that one part of us continually drives the other toward self-doubt, fear, paranoia, shame, and despair, without revealing that it is doing this or that there might be other options available. Panic and self-flagellation become identified with safety and virtue. No attention is drawn toward the partiality of the choices that are being made internally—otherwise the game would be up. Self-loathing may be the order of the day but it is never presented as such. We just think that we are “normal,” hard-headed and interpreting reality as it truly is.</p>
<p>Release from the grip of self-loathing therefore has to start with an awareness of what we are doing to ourselves—and what the alternatives might be. For example, we might start to notice that no sooner has something nice happened to us than we set about wondering when something awful will strike in revenge; that every success has to be ruined by a feeling of foreboding and guilt; that every potentially pleasant day ends up marred by panic or a sense of loss; that we spontaneously imagine that everyone must hate us and that the worst things are being said about us the moment we leave any room.</p>
<p>None of this looks on the surface like “nastiness.” We could just say that we have a “worried mind” or a “regretful temperament.” But it is useful to group these ideas under a single title in order to fully identify the direction in which they point: toward the systematic destruction of any pleasure in being ourselves. This is, when we think about it, a very nasty thing indeed to do to someone. Without realizing it, we are committed to throttling our chances of contentment. We dwell inside a mind in which every good element has to be spoilt and every vicious, destructive, alarming, and cruel thought has to be honored.</p>
<p>As an experiment, we might imagine trying to be as kind as possible to our own minds, in order to see how differently things might unfold. Rather than dragging every last deformed and mean idea into the theater of consciousness, we could dare to be vigilant about only presenting our minds with the very kindest and most reassuring ideas. The moment we leave a room, we could ruthlessly prevent thoughts about our unacceptability from manifesting themselves in the usual way; they might beg to be let in, claiming all sorts of reasons why they should be, but for once we could give them a firm “no.” If they keep trying to force their way into our minds, we might put on a piece of music or do some gardening—anything other than allow destructive thoughts to have their normal hold over us.</p>
<p>Likewise, when the old familiar thought about the future being terrible knocks at the door, we might refuse to let it in. When we wake up with the traditional burden of guilt about our past mistakes, we might decide to pay no attention. We then realize that we have agency over the things that fill our minds and that we don’t have to surrender control to our masochistic stage manager at every turn.</p>
<p>We might along the way start to appreciate that other people do not give their worst thoughts unlimited sway. They don’t give endless time to ideas of their own dreadfulness or their likely destruction. They don’t allow whole days to be lost in catastrophic forebodings. And one way to make sense of the reason for this is that they are fundamentally, without being aware of it in this way, kind to themselves ; they are not in the business of torturing their own spirits.</p>
<p>Where does this unconscious impulse to be unkind to ourselves come from? How is the choice to torture ourselves made? We can hazard another generalization. The way we treat ourselves is an internalization of the way others once treated us, either directly in the sense of how they spoke to us or indirectly in the sense of how they behaved around us, which could have included ignoring us or openly displaying a preference for someone else.</p>
<p>Our early caregivers did not literally instruct us to worry about our right to exist or tell us to panic constantly about what might happen next. But the way that our minds now work bears the imprint of their relationship to us; it is an extrapolation from their messages of fear and ridicule, humiliation and shame, which we have absorbed as careful students.</p>
<p>To get a measure of where we stand on the spectrum of self-love, we need only ask ourselves a very simple question—one that we have nevertheless ignored for far too long: How much do I like myself? If the answer immediately and intuitively comes back that we feel we are loathsome, there is a history that we urgently need to consider and are, conveniently for our self-torturing minds, choosing to ignore. The contempt we habitually show ourselves is neither fair nor right. We should spot the oddity and partiality of treating ourselves with a viciousness that we wouldn’t accord to our worst enemies.</p>
<p>This self-hatred breeds low self-confidence and a continual fear of disaster. Terrible things must, after all, happen to terrible people. We are denied any confidence in ourselves as workers, parents, friends, and humans more broadly, and are terrified both when things go well, because our comeuppance is sure to be just around the corner, and when we contemplate the future, which must be filled with dreadful and threatening prospects. It’s one of the more unexpected features of mental life that what manifests itself as “anxiety” is really, at heart, a form of intense self-suspicion.</p>
<p>For a long time, self-hatred can be disguised within an outwardly normal life. The destruction blends in. But just how dangerous and unfair we are being to ourselves is likely to come to the fore when we hit a crisis, making some sort of a mistake or encountering a reversal. At moments when anyone might experience a dip in their degrees of self-love and confidence, we enter a completely different and more perilous zone. The bad news confirms every one of our savage impulses and self-suspicions. It kick-starts efforts to conclusively tear ourselves apart. Not only are we somewhat in trouble and responsible; we are, as we tell ourselves, a catastrophe and despicable, foul and damned. Self-torture can quickly end up with compulsive thoughts of self-extinction.</p>
<p>People who commit suicide aren’t those for whom a few things have gone very wrong; they are people who have encountered some otherwise survivable reversals against a background of fierce self-hatred. It is the self-hatred that will end up killing them, not the apparent subjects of their panic and sorrow.</p>
<p>As ever, salvation comes through self-awareness. There is nothing inevitable about self-hatred. We are treating ourselves unkindly because people were in the past not especially kind to us—and we are being touchingly yet dangerously loyal to their philosophies of derision. Harshness can have a glamour all of its own; it can seem the more serious and powerful approach to take toward our characters, as though we were doing ourselves a favor, and even securing our safety, by whipping our consciences as hard as possible.</p>
<p>But if we’re to stay alive, we need radically to redraw our moral code and return to kindness the prestige that it should always have had. Kindness to ourselves is the single most necessary quality for success and endurance. That we spent so long on the side of cruelty is a sign not of its utility, but of the scale of the distortions we have inherited from the past. We have learned far too much about a lack of mercy, about panic, about self-suspicion and finding oneself pitiful. Now, when we have felt the temptations of suicide, we need to rediscover the virtues of forgiveness, mercy, calm, and gentleness. And when we panic and feel intensely anxious about the future, we need to remember that we are in essence worrying about our fundamental legitimacy and lovability. Our survival depends on a swift mastery of the varied arts of self-compassion.</p>
<p>9 Gratitude</p>
<p>A particularly unfortunate consequence of mental illness is its power to close us off from the world, from its beauty, its interest, and its power to distract us from ourselves. We are liable to be so engulfed in what feels like a life-or-death struggle, we forget that there is anything outside the walls of our own minds. Every morning is likely to begin with fear and trepidation; it feels like a close-run thing whether we will make it to evening. In the circumstances, there is little chance to observe the dawn, we don’t hear the birdsong, and we miss the way the rising sun briefly dressed the horizon in a mantle of purple gold.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when we were children, we were champions at observation. A simple walk to the park offered a treasury of discoveries. There was the brick wall along which we liked to run our hands; there was an ant that we saw on the sidewalk and followed until it disappeared into a mysterious hole just wide enough to take its body; there was a small yellow flower growing in some rubble whose stem we caressed and whose petals we rubbed against our cheek. There were the clouds we observed, stretching and distending themselves like swirls of milk in coffee; there were the three gigantic trees whose weathered bark we ran our nails across and wanted, if we’d been able, to knead and wrap ourselves in.</p>
<p>It can feel as if there is no time for such frivolities now. Adult life has grown drained of delight. We spend hours poring over our emotions with therapists, we visit psychiatric doctors, we sit in ugly rooms discussing our pains with strangers.</p>
<p>It isn’t that we have resolutely turned our minds against appreciation. We simply lack encouragement—and, we might say, permission. We need to have it confirmed to us by some external source that it is not trivial to look up from ourselves for a while, that the capacity to find delight in so-called “small things” is at the core of recovery and strength. Appreciation may once have been automatic but that isn’t an argument against a little artificiality in restarting its engines. We may need to be nudged, occasionally, to pause with our travails and take a moment to look around. The huge things won’t be solved quickly. We’re going to be with anxiety and despair for a little while longer yet. But that is no reason to shun moments of relief.</p>
<p>It is artists who may best stimulate our appetite for observing the world through the evidence of their own heightened sensitivities. We might consider, for example, the work of Gustave Caillebotte (1848–94), an exceptionally generous observer of our place on the earth. He looked closely at summer fruit, skies, the view from the window in mid-afternoon, the atmosphere in the park. In 1875, while staying in his family’s home in Yerres, south of Paris, he went down to the river on a gray day and grew fascinated by the patterns made by large drops of summer rain on the surface of the water. We have seen such a sight hundreds of times before, but are unlikely—for a long while at least—to have given it its due, to have grown appropriately mesmerized by the complex geometries of interlocking circles, by the refractions of light, by the variegated sounds of water falling into water.</p>
<p>Gustave Caillebotte, Yerres, Effect of Rain, 1875.</p>
<p>Caillebotte’s painting isn’t about our distress. It doesn’t know anything about the broken relationship with our spouse, our troubles with lawyers, our financial anxieties, our fear of the future . . . But it seems to grasp that such things might exist and yet insist that they do not, right now, need to swallow the whole of our lives. For a moment or two, we can slip out of ourselves, pause on our walk by the riverbank and take in something that will remind us that it is worth keeping on with existence.</p>
<p>We might, following the example of Caillebotte, sometimes interrupt our internal dialogue in order to study daisies in jars, someone’s hands, an old map, a photo from childhood, a pencil on a new sheet of paper. We have suffered so much, we are so aware of all that is difficult and arduous, but we have not been barred from adopting the wide-eyedness of children and artists. Indeed, it is against the backdrop of our difficulties that beauty becomes not just pleasing but moving—a reminder of our true home, to which we so long to return.</p>
<p>In our efforts to appreciate what is still good, we might also take a lead from the exceptionally busy Yinzhen (1678–1735), fifth emperor of China’s Qing dynasty, who was much preoccupied with reforming his country’s taxation system and rooting out corruption in local officials, but nevertheless found the time to take his son and a few of his favorite courtiers out for a picnic in the fields near Beijing, in order to look at the flowers, at some point around 1725.</p>
<p>It is touching to note the solemn expression of the Emperor, who has interrupted the affairs of state for something as easy to overlook as some spring flowers. Yinzhen was known to have been a deeply pious and serious man, but he evidently retained a secure hold on life’s real priorities, nudging us to recalibrate our own hierarchy of importance in the direction of the overlooked beauty of the everyday. If an emperor can do this, then we—for all our afflictions—can too.</p>
<p>The Yongzheng Emperor Admiring Flowers, c. 1725.</p>
<p>Much remains imperfect; most of us have lives that are not as we would want them to be. But this should not become a reason to refuse modest pleasures. We should be sure to carve out moments when, despite everything, we can still savor incidental arguments for hope, sweetness, and an end to suffering.</p>
<p>10 Routines</p>
<p>We understand that in order to create a world-class athlete, it isn’t enough to work on someone’s muscle strength. We need to watch how they sleep, what they eat, the company they keep, the clothes they wear. Similar care is taken when trying to train elite soldiers or musicians; a whole way of life has to be examined and adjusted in order to deliver the right results. The foremost example of this totalizing approach can be found in the history of religions. Behind the invention of the monastery is the notion that, in order to fashion a mind that can focus appropriately on the divine, a great many details will need to be considered and rethought: what sort of hairstyle someone has, the kind of material their tunic is made out of, what time they have breakfast, how they sit when they read or contemplate and what the view should look like out of the window.</p>
<p>Underpinning such interest is a conception of the human being as immensely susceptible to the influence of what we in the secular realm tend to call, with fateful neglect, “small things.” It seldom occurs to us to trace the connection between apparently incidental sensory and physical routines and what passes through our minds. We treat the mind as a more or less wholly isolated organ that can continue to function as we would want it to whatever food we serve it, however much rest we give it and whatever the architectural or natural vistas that lie before its eyes. We implicitly deem it impossible that our thoughts could be heavily colored by the sort of light we are exposed to, the articles we read, or the kind of exercise we take. No such indifference was ever permitted in Zen Buddhism or Catholicism. These careful belief systems developed elaborate traditions around posture, tea drinking, breathing, and gardening because they did not subscribe to our walled-off vision of the mind. They saw continuity between beliefs and, among other elements, how we bathe, the words we say on waking up, the kind of crockery we use, and the speed at which we eat our dinner.</p>
<p>We should take inspiration from this spiritual vigilance in the quest for our own mental health. We should borrow from the manic sensitivity of religions to imagine spaces and routines that can give our minds the best possible chances of finding and then holding on to robust reasons to keep living.</p>
<p>Here are some of the elements we might consider.</p>
<p>SLEEP</p>
<p>Part of the reason why many of us have a tangled and unhelpful relationship with sleep can be traced back to the way we first learned about the subject many years ago. Parents of small children tend to be very careful about bedtimes. They favor early nights, give their babies plenty of naps throughout the day, think a lot about black-out curtains, are quick to diagnose many instances of bad temper as stemming from a background deficit of rest and, while they may be indulgent in some areas, are likely to be entirely implacable in any negotiation over routines.</p>
<p>None of this is remotely altruistic: tired small children are a nightmare to look after. Every reversal becomes a drama, every disappointment turns into a catastrophe, and every excitement shifts into mania. A halfway decent adult existence is impossible alongside a tired child. Self-interest necessitates totalitarianism.</p>
<p>But while a draconian philosophy is useful in the early years, it can set up an awkward dynamic in an offspring’s mind as adolescence sets in. Growing up and asserting their independence and individuality can then become associated with a newly defiant and cavalier approach to bedtimes. Not for a newly empowered young adult the strictures and denying rules of the past. Why bother to put the light out by ten or even midnight, given that they are so obviously no longer a toddler? And as they have no more use for nappies, why worry that they are still finishing something on the computer as the first signs of dawn appear in the eastern sky?</p>
<p>What is thereby missed is how much every adult shares in a young child’s sensitivity to a shortfall of sleep. Just like our younger selves, we do not automatically have a reasonable view of our own prospects or condition. There are many different ways of telling the stories of our lives, ranging from optimistic accounts of progress mixed with noble defeats to tragic narratives of thorough going stupidity and unforgivable errors. What determines the difference between madness and sanity may be nothing grander, but then again nothing more critical, than how long our heads have been allowed to lie on a pillow in the preceding hours.</p>
<p>It’s especially unfortunate that this connection is so easy to miss. No bells go off in our minds warning us that we are running low on nocturnal nectar; there are no parents around any longer to nag us up to our rooms; plenty of well-meaning friends invite us out for meals that begin at 9 p.m.; our screens never fail to have something new and interesting to tell us at every hour. What’s more, no stylish or authoritative figures in the public realm ever seem to urge us to turn in early or proudly show off their cautious bedtime routines. Being meticulous about sleep is something that only a very dull or defeated person would care about.</p>
<p>As a result, we start to believe many dark things with doomful ease: that our relationship is over, that everyone hates us, that our lives are meaningless, and that human existence is a cosmic joke. As Friedrich Nietzsche knew, “When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.” We go mad from tiredness long before we notice the role that exhaustion is playing in stealing our sanity.</p>
<p>We need to recover some of the wisdom of our early years. We may be a sizeable height, holding down an important job, and capable of performing impressive feats, but in terms of our vulnerability to emotional chaos, we are no more robust than a very young infant. Whenever we sense our spirits sinking and folly and anxiety pressing in on us, we should abandon all endeavors and head to the bedroom. We should be as proud of our regimented sleep patterns as we are of a neat house or a flourishing career.</p>
<p>Underpinning our care should be modesty. While thinking through our problems is crucial to our health, to attempt to think without enough sleep is worse than not thinking at all. The thinking we do when tired is vindictive and sloppy. It misses important details, gives the advantage to our enemies, and hands victory to the evangelists of sadness. It isn’t disrespectful to the power of the mind to insist that we shouldn’t attempt to fire up this machine unless and until it has been adequately restored to health—like a powerful rocket or exquisite motorboat that we wouldn’t dare to activate unless we could be sure of a clear sky or a calm sea.</p>
<p>Understanding our vulnerability, we should never take seriously any worry that suddenly appears extremely pressing after ten in the evening. What we panic about in the early hours should automatically be discounted. No large conversation or argument should ever be undertaken past nine o’clock.</p>
<p>Being careful doesn’t just apply to the night. At varied points in the day, when we are overwhelmed, we should know to stop and hoist a white flag. It may look as if we should keep trying to fight our demons. In fact, we need to sidestep them with a nap. We may feel guilty, but it is lazier and more irresponsible to try to keep going than it is to know the game is up for now. There is never anything shameful in admitting we can’t cope. It’s this very knowledge that guarantees us a chance to fight another round soon.</p>
<p>When we lie in bed, it makes sense to think of ourselves as akin to a smaller, furry mammal, a rabbit or perhaps a squirrel. We should lift our knees up very close to our chests and pull our duvets over our heads. We might soak a whole patch of the pillow with our tears. We should metaphorically stroke our own weary foreheads as a loving adult might once have done. Grown-up life is intolerably hard and we should be allowed to know and lament this.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t feel weird in our weepy-squirrel position. Other people go to immense lengths to hide that they do, or would like to do, the very same sort of thing. We need to know someone extremely well—better than we know 99 percent of humanity—before they will let us in on the scale of their despair and anxiety and their longings for a cozy, safe nook. It looks childlike but it is in fact the essence of adulthood to recognize and make space for our regressive tendencies.</p>
<p>What the curled-squirrel position indicates is that not all mental problems can be solved by active reasoning. Not thinking consciously should also be deemed a part of the mind’s work. Being curled up in bed allows our minds to do a different sort of thinking, the sort that can take place when we are no longer impatiently looking for results, when the usual hectoring conscious self takes a break and lets the mind do what it will for a time. It is then, paradoxically, that certain richer, more creative ideas can have the peace and freedom to coalesce, as they may do when we are out for a walk or idling in a cafe. Thinking isn’t what we do best when it’s all we’re meant to do.</p>
<p>There remain plenty of reasons to live. We simply may not be able to see them until we have allowed ourselves the privilege of a weepy nap or a long night’s sleep.</p>
<p>FOOD</p>
<p>Mental illness is often bound up with a sense of shame, self-disgust, and self-flagellation. We scour our past for reasons to hate who we are. We appear in our own eyes as unworthy and despicable candidates who should never have been allowed to be.</p>
<p>It’s a measure of the close connection between diet and mental health that such thoughts are particularly likely to come to the fore following certain sorts of meals. After a lunch or dinner soaked in trans fat and sodium nitrate, processed sugar and corn syrup, saccharin and palm oil, potassium benzoate and butylated hydroxyanisole, reasons for our non-existence can appear especially persuasive.</p>
<p>In a quest for mental health, we would be advised to take in only those ingredients that help dampen our anxiety, weaken our self-hatred, and strengthen our sense of hope. Some of the following are especially to be recommended in a diet for a vulnerable mind.</p>
<p>Camomile tea</p>
<p>We, the ones forever on the edge of madness, hardly require anything to stimulate us further. We have visions aplenty without the fluorescent colors added by caffeine or alcohol. What we require above all else is something that can slow our racing thoughts and hold us to our most sensible and quiet mental pathways. With a cup full of hot camomile tea, we will be forced to sip slowly, the steam will gently caress our eyelids and we will treat ourselves as who—without any pejorative connotations—we really are: convalescents.</p>
<p>Figs</p>
<p>We should incline toward foods that have been tampered with as little as possible by the artifice and wiliness of chemists, foods that would have been around in much the same form when the world still had some of its original innocence and quiet. The fig seems to understand sadness and vulnerability. It keeps its appeal muted and it may not be until after we have eaten one that we properly appreciate how nourishing and flavorful it was beneath its serene, unshowy exterior. It urges us to follow it in its attitude of humility and reticence.</p>
<p>Nuts</p>
<p>Especially sympathetic to mental health are handfuls of walnuts and hazelnuts, cashew nuts, and (unsalted) pistachios. They seem to rein in the ambitions that ordinarily torture us. They satisfy us with little and thereby urge us to quieten our restlessness and ignore the chatter and excitement of the public square. They reach a special pitch of sanity-inducing goodness when accompanied by three or four dried apricots.</p>
<p>Dates</p>
<p>A good life can’t be free of moments of delight and ecstasy and the date knows this. There has to be room for a degree of excitement. The date delivers ravishment when required, but it is also limited in its power to derail us. It will never render us manic. We could not—even though it can seem as though we might—become addicts of this fruit. It won’t allow us to escape ourselves for too long but it will, for a few moments at least, reorient us toward the light.</p>
<p>Feta cheese, Kalamata olives, and bread</p>
<p>This should count as a meal for us in moods of mental torment, taking us back to a basic existence and reassuring us that this can be tolerable and wholesome. We don’t need very much to survive. The walls may have closed in and yet pleasure can be drawn from the most apparently insignificant elements. We may lose everything but there will still be this, and alongside it the love and care of a few imaginative and loyal people.</p>
<p>Dark chocolate</p>
<p>It can be as black as the night we fear, but it is—without melodramatic sweetness and with a grown-up understanding sternness—on our side. It leaves behind an almost metallic taste that endows us with courage and resolve without adding guilt or judgment.</p>
<p>In our ill moods we’re unlikely to have the energy to cook or even think about food, so we can end up highly vulnerable to the blandishments of processed dishes. Yet we should take care that food never becomes yet another reason why we might hate ourselves or regret decisions. We should lean on a few simple menus to carry us across the most difficult, frightened phases of our inner lives.</p>
<p>BATHING</p>
<p>It is a sign of our lack of civilization that we insist on thinking of baths primarily as tools to clean ourselves with rather than honoring them as what they truly are: instruments of mental health.</p>
<p>The Romans would have been astonished by our modern plumbing, our ability to summon up a flawless cauldron of piping-hot water at the turn of a tap inside almost every home at negligible cost. Our boilers would have awed them, our pipework would have been the envy of their engineers. These were people who did not consider a country or province properly colonized until public baths had been constructed, who moved mountains and cut through forests to ensure a regular supply of water, who left behind elegant bathing establishments from northern England to the edges of the Sahara desert, from Mérida in the Iberian West to Palmyra in the Levantine East.</p>
<p>And yet it would have puzzled the Romans how silent we are on the deeper resonances of bathing, how few poems and odes there are to our moments in the tub, how unimaginative we tend to be about the powers of hot water to heal our souls.</p>
<p>All of us have come from warm, watery encasements and, when mental troubles strike, we should immediately head back into the bath to be held, as the womb once did, in a tight aquatic embrace.</p>
<p>Hot water is a symbol of love and care. It allows us to let down our guard and, as at so few other moments, to be at once defenseless and safe, naked yet cozy. We can bolt the door, turn down the lights, and allow ourselves to do nothing for a time other than watch the water lap at our knees and occasionally up the temperature with a small scalding infusion.</p>
<p>We don’t need to force ourselves to arrive at any great conclusions. This is a time to idle and free-associate. We can let the mind wander, perhaps backward to more innocent days or to the moment when the troubles began. We can float over our lives without our usual critical inclinations. We can drown our pain in the heat, cauterize our mental wounds, and let our tears lose themselves in the steam.</p>
<p>We may want to keep a small towel and a pad of paper and a pencil by the bath, in case something strikes us that could put a better spin on our travails. Or we can simply float and wait for some of the panic to subside, as it surely will.</p>
<p>Those of us who suffer in our minds should not be embarrassed to have as many as three baths a day, each one lasting up to an hour. They will be the enamel ships that carry us over the worst of our griefs.</p>
<p>EXERCISE</p>
<p>One of the great impediments to taking exercise is the idea that being unwilling to do so must be caused first and foremost by something called “laziness.” The reason why we are sitting on the couch a lot, or are spending a considerable time in bed, or are seriously reluctant to run is that we are, in essence, bone idle.</p>
<p>But we must get to the root of what is really going on with the mentally unwell. They don’t sit around because they are lazy but because they are ill, and it’s a specific feature of mental illness that you may be especially hampered when it comes to the matter of moving your body with any degree of vigor.</p>
<p>One might say that mental illness makes one retreat—from the world in general, its trees, its people, its sagas and concerns and joys. But it also makes us retreat from our own body, from its limbs, its skin, and its right to be. One might say that illness squats at the front of consciousness in pain and is reluctant to let anything carefree or mobile or fluid get through.</p>
<p>Many varieties of mental illness freeze us, not with fear necessarily, though that too, but with self-hatred, shame, anxiety, and regret. With such moods coursing through us, we are in no position to stretch, to run, or to gambol. We are rooted to our spot, a place of sadness, misery, and dread.</p>
<p>We know all the arguments in favor of exercise—they are incontestable. Our limbs need to move, our lungs need rapid oxygenation, our skin needs to sweat vigorously. But when we are ill these arguments end up feeling punitive and accusatory. They remind us of all that we are incapable of, of how badly we have failed and of how awful we are.</p>
<p>To have any chance of exercising, we need a different, more forgiving approach, one built first on a lot of modesty. Because we are ill we can’t be an athlete, certainly not for now. So by “exercise” we mean something far gentler than might ideally be recommended. The only exercise we are capable of will be mild in the extreme—realistically, we are talking about going for a walk and not much more. This doesn’t sound like any sort of feat, but nor do many of the achievements of those who are in recovery. They become heroic only once we know what the individual had to go through to pull them off.</p>
<p>The walk might be only once or twice around the block, but it will still be extremely valuable, especially if it’s repeated every day. In many forms of mental illness, such is our degree of shame we don’t feel we have permission to leave the house. We feel it is illegitimate to be outside “enjoying” ourselves, worried that we will be seen and negatively judged. We want to hide because we feel like a monster in the eyes of others. So it’s an enormous feat to put on a coat and, against all our instincts, wander out as though the world could be a habitable, welcoming, and safe place.</p>
<p>Yet how salutary it can be to take the risk, because there is healing to be found in the sight of the trees on the horizon, the starlings in a hedge, a duck by the meadow, a dog next to the supermarket. What we are seeing is soothing evidence that the world exists beyond our own cruel, mean-spirited ill minds. There is so much that knows nothing of us, that is gloriously indifferent—those stars appearing in the dusk sky—and that isn’t there to shame us. We slowly reinhabit our bodies. Outside seems so much more normal than what is inside our heads and we can take inspiration: Someone is moving house, a child is playing with a stick, there is a cat on a wall resting in the sun. Things may not be as awful as we had assumed when it was just us in the bedroom, going through the narrow, dark corridors of memory. We can feel our feet taking slightly longer steps, our lungs working a little harder. We have walked once around the block already and no one has attacked us, no one has mocked us, no one is laughing. We are doing extremely well.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t push it. Exercise can be very minor and still wholly beneficial. We aren’t going to be marathon runners, but we have managed something extraordinary nonetheless. We’re athletes of a different sort, tackling a different enemy, and our battle is already well under way.</p>
<p>SILENCE</p>
<p>The news media serves two essential constituencies: people who are running nations and businesses; and people whose lives are a little too quiet, a little too undramatic, and a little too serene for their own tastes.</p>
<p>These two broad categories are unlikely to comprise anyone who self-identifies as mentally unwell. The last thing that we need when things are going awry in our minds is yet more evidence of folly, melodrama, chaos, aggression, partisanship, and an absence of forgiveness. We owe it to ourselves to become willingly more ignorant of what is going on in our highly disturbed and disturbing media.</p>
<p>The minds of the mentally ill are already engaged in titanic struggles and battles. While there may be no outward movement, inside heroic efforts will be taking place to answer back against the monsters of self-hatred and to hold the door against the hounds of self-contempt. They will be facing floodwaters of anxiety that try to sweep away every last hope in their path, crushing like toys elements placed in their way, like plans and affiliations and a sense of identity. If we could hear this struggle it would have some of the melodrama of a Wagner opera; and if we could see it it would have the turbulent quality of a Turner painting. Someone could be sitting down on the couch, looking sad, occasionally putting a finger to their lips, while inside their benighted mind scenes might be unfolding akin to Valley of Aosta: Snowstorm, Avalanche, and Thunderstorm set to the sound of “Ride of the Valkyries.”</p>

<p>In the circumstances, we don’t need to have our nerve endings further shocked or titillated. What we urgently need, and may die without, is quiet. Despite the pressure to “stay informed” and know “what is going on,” our real responsibilities lie elsewhere: in not knowing a great many things in order to keep faith with life itself. We will have our hands full reviewing our past, battling despair, and hanging on to reasons why it might be worth surviving until next summer. This leaves no time to be curious about the parliamentary elections or the latest dilemmas facing an actor and her partner. The apparently innocent activity of reading the headlines now counts as a hugely reckless act.</p>
<p>We should tell those who love us and are living in our vicinity to help us direct our minds toward hope and kindness. We should beg them to switch off all media and not bring any papers into the house. Let them not refer to anything that hasn’t been around for 200 years at least. We should focus on eternal verities and on small sympathetic, generous ideas nearer to home.</p>
<p>We need serenity in which to challenge our beliefs that we are awful, that the worst will happen to us and that we won’t be able to survive. We need calm in which to rebuild faith in ourselves and in existence more broadly. To assist us, we need interiors like those depicted in the works of the great Danish master of stillness Vilhelm Hammershøi, rooms in which the sun washes on to clean, empty surfaces and all that can be heard in the distance might be the sounds of a child playing in the yard or some pigeons on the roof opposite. We don’t need any further arguments in favor of chaos and nastiness. We have enough of this in our heads for twelve lifetimes. We don’t need to titillate ourselves with the thought that the world might boil or be rocked by a nuclear accident or that a new disease might ravage us. Let someone else keep an eye on the bigger picture, calling us only when the crisis is at the door; for now, leave us to fight our inner world-shaking struggles in a corner of a quiet, sunlit room.</p>
