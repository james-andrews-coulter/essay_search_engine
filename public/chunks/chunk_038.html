            <h2>Intelligence &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Early on in the history of melancholy, the Greek philosopher Aristotle was said to have raised a question which can’t help but sound a bit smug: Why is it that so many of those who have become outstanding in philosophy, statesmanship, poetry or the arts have been melancholic? As evidence of a link between melancholy and brilliance, Aristotle cited Plato, Socrates, Hercules and Ajax. The association stuck: in the Medieval period, melancholic people were said to have been born ‘under the sign of Saturn’, the then furthest known planet from the Earth, associated with cold and gloom – but also with the power to inspire extraordinary feats of imagination. There developed pride in being melancholic; such people could perhaps discern things that the more cheerful would miss.</p>
<p>Proud of their identities as ambassadors of sadness, young English aristocrats commissioned portraits of themselves in melancholy poses, wearing melancholy’s characteristic colour (black) and gazing forlornly into the middle distance, sighing at an imperfection that they were smart enough not to deny.</p>
<p>In 1514, Albrecht Dürer depicted the figure of Melancholy as a dejected angel, surrounded by a range of neglected scientific and mathematical instruments. To one side of the angel he placed a polyhedron, one of the most complicated but technically perfect of geometric forms. The angel had fallen into dejection – the suggestion ran – at the contrast between her longing for rationality, precision, beauty and order, and the actual conditions of the world.</p>
<p>If we are to take Aristotle’s question seriously, what is it that intelligent, melancholy people might notice that other, lesser minds may miss? To start a list: how insincere most social occasions are; the gap between what others say and what they mean; the bluster of politicians and corporations; the futility of all efforts to become famous or well thought of; the loneliness that dogs us even within the most intimate relationships; the disappointments of parenting; the compromises of friendship; the ugliness of cities; and the brevity of our own lives.</p>
<p>It would be far too simple to say that dark insights alone can make a person clever. In so far as we can fairly associate melancholy with intelligence, it is because the melancholy person skirts two characteristic errors of weaker minds: rage on the one hand, and naïvety on the other.</p>
<p>Like many an angry person, the melancholy soul knows that things are not as they should be, but, at the same time, they resist the temptation to respond to provocations with fury. They can seek justice, but they are all the while steadied by a ballast of realism. They will not suddenly be surprised by events and lash back at them with viciousness; they have known the broad dimensions of reality from the outset.</p>
<p>Albrecht Dürer,Melencolia I, 1514</p>
<p>At the same time, melancholy positions a person ideally in relation to hope. The melancholic do not, like the naïve, imagine that they can have flawless lives. They don’t play the lottery of romantic love or of professional success. They know the odds they would be beating with even a halfway-tolerable relationship and an only-sometimes-maddening job. But this doesn’t have to mean that they can never smile or appreciate what is beautiful or tender. Arguably, it’s their awareness of a fundamental darkness that lends them the energy to pay particular attention to the brighter moments that will at points streak across the pitch-black firmament. The melancholy can be intensely grateful and sometimes giddily joyful because they know grief so well – not because they have never suffered at all. They can be very keen to dance (badly) and to make a great deal out of a sunny day or a perfect meal. A child will laugh because something is funny; a melancholy adult will laugh with greater depth still, because they know how many things are so sad.</p>
<p>Being disappointed isn’t any sort of intellectual achievement, and nor is being merry. The real feat of character is to keep one’s fury in check even though one is a bit broken, and maintain hope even though much is self-evidently wretched. In so far as the melancholy person can lay claim to any form of superior intelligence, it isn’t because they have read a lot of books or dress fetchingly in black. It’s because they have succeeded at finding the best possible accommodation between the infinite disappointments and occasional wonders of life.</p>
