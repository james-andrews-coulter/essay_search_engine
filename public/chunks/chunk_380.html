        <h4>3. Relationship with the Transcendent</h4>
<p>For me personally, the transcendent is God. It is the desire for an ever more intimate relationship with God that drives my own desire to be alone, and many of the great
  solitude-seekers have had a similar passion. It was this that led the early Christian hermits out of their cities and into the enormous solitude of the desert; and later drove the Irish hermits to
  seek out tiny islands across dangerous seas, like Columba of Iona. But the search for solitude is not confined to Christianity. From the earliest traditions, Buddhists, who do not identify a
  ‘God’ in the Western sense, have nonetheless – more than anyone else, perhaps – used solitude and silence as a vehicle of transcendence, and have evolved a massive
  ‘how-to manual’ to support that practice.</p>
<p>In fact there is no major (and I do not know of any minor) religious or spiritual tradition that does not recognize solitude as a part of the necessary practice for revelation, intimacy and
  knowledge. This would suggest that those who desire an experience of the transcendent might look to a range of these well-worked traditions to see what they are up to, and how to achieve that
  experience of transcendence. But the state of joyful consciousness beyond the limits of the personal, the framework of the ego, does not require a religious framework.</p>
<p>It would appear that a period of being alone is a prelude to initiation of many kinds. We know that Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad all spent periods in solitude before launching their
  religious missions. We know that what the Tibetan Buddhist nun Tenzin Palmo has called the ‘pressure cooker’ of solitude and retreat is normally (though there are exceptions) a
  necessary precursor to intense religious experiences, especially those we usually called ‘mystical’.</p>
<p>In many societies throughout the world a period of solitude is seen as a necessary part of such ritual initiation, and especially for rites of passage – those ceremonies which mark the
  transitions from one social status to another. Many Aboriginal youths, for example, are sent out into the desert, alone, for up to six months in some cases, to fend for themselves, before they can
  be deemed to be adults. Other societies arrange other kinds of seclusion for these crucial times of transition. For example, the Takuna of the north-west Amazon see the time when a young woman
  starts to menstruate as being particularly perilous; they have created a complex ritual, the Festa das Mocas Novas (the Feast of the New Women), which both protects and celebrates the
  event.</p>
<p>This ritual happens when a girl first menstruates; for somewhere between four and twelve weeks, she lives alone in a little room specially built inside the family home, which represents the
  underworld, where she is hidden from dangerous demons called the Noo. As the rite reaches its climax guests arrive wearing masks to impersonate the Noo and the girl is painted with black dye. She
  remains in the chamber and after three more days, under the protection of her family, she is led out to a celebration and dances all night, until dawn. She is then given a flaming brand by a shaman
  to throw at the Noo; their demonic power is broken and the girl is deemed to be an adult woman.</p>
<p>In mediaeval Europe both religious people (monks and nuns) and men about to become knights passed the night preceding their initiation in a ‘vigil’, awake but alone in preparation
  for their initiations.</p>
<p>These sorts of experience are not by any means limited to religious contexts, although socially recognized rituals probably make it easier to access the emotional states of transcendence.
  Bernard Moitessier, the single-handed yachtsman mentioned in Part III, seems to have loved being alone at sea mainly because it brought on these experiences of intense unitive awareness of
  transcendence. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge used to stand on the very edge of cliffs to provoke vertigo, which gave him a direct sensation of the transcendent (this is not a method I would
  advocate). John Muir, the pioneer early conservationist and inspiration behind the National Parks movement, describes poising himself on the very edge of an enormous waterfall in order to feel its
  power and glory. For him this clearly went beyond the ‘attunement to nature’ I discussed in the previous chapter, and opened a way into mystical experience very close to religious
  ecstasy.</p>
<p>Because rites of passage are found in almost all societies, and take such an extraordinary variety of forms – not all of them necessarily including solitude or exclusion from the group
  – it is difficult to generalize about what is going on or why this is so crucial to the human psyche. But this sense of meeting or encounter between transcendent powers and the individual,
  alone, in liminal space, is so pervasive that it is hard not to trust to such universal wisdom.</p>
