        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We don’t normally associate ‘true friendship’ with the word ‘ambition’. Unease around linking the two concepts goes back a long way. In the first major Western discussion of friendship, Aristotle’s analysis of happiness known as the Nicomachean Ethics, there is a warning against friendships that only serve a narrow personal advantage: people whose businesses overlap, who can give each other a professional leg-up or who share mutually profitable information about government contracts. This isn’t genuine friendship, says Aristotle; it’s just a temporary alignment of material interests. But despite this well-intentioned, Ancient Greek reminder of the dangers of cynical alliances, we don’t need to banish every aspect of ambition from our considerations of friendship. We just need to approach the idea of ambition from a different angle.</p>
<p>The less often mentioned, but essential, purpose of friendship is emotional growth. In the company of a real friend, we should aspire to become wiser, more sensitive, more able to cope with the complexity of existence, more resilient and more generous. We may not put it in such explicit terms, but we should relish a friend because, in their presence, we are able to grow into a better version of ourselves. We don’t need to shy away from saying what friendship is for – or what advantages it can bring. We just need to raise our sights.</p>
<p>With a better definition of the purpose of friendship, our lives might then evolve in some of the following ways.</p>
<p>(i) Losing friends</p>
<p>We would realise that there were some people we felt goodwill towards who didn’t after all help us – in any noble way – to be who we needed to be. We might over many years have called them ‘friends’: we might have seen them quite often; they might have been pleasant enough – maybe even very pleasant – but as we can now see, they had nothing to contribute to our development towards calm, kindness and insight.</p>
<p>There is no need to be brutal – the pruning can be humane in the extreme – but neither do we have unlimited time. We won’t find the friendships we require, or fulfil the potential of our souls, if we cannot ever bear gently to sidestep an extraneous suggestion of dinner.</p>
<p>(ii) Relegating friends</p>
<p>We might – similarly – need to downgrade the intensity of certain friendships. We were perhaps for a time very close to someone and their company changed our lives; around them we learnt things that allowed us to establish ourselves or develop a part of our personality. But maybe we learnt the lessons – and now we are in a different phase and facing fresh dilemmas.</p>
<p>The idea of kindly relegation makes sense in other areas of life. A pianist might have had a great teacher early on, someone who formed their talent and guided their tastes, but if the relationship succeeded, the student then might not need the teacher to be on hand as they were at the start of the journey. They would always be grateful and might keep in close touch, but they would know that, henceforth, they needed to derive their lessons from elsewhere.</p>
<p>We might similarly outgrow a friend thanks to their talent at answering to a missing part of us, like a child who – at 19 or 25 – doesn’t need a parent close by any more. Not so much because the parent hasn’t done well, but precisely because they have fulfilled their brief to perfection: through their devotion and their talent, they have enabled the child to move on.</p>
<p>We can be deeply glad that a particular person was once at the centre of our lives. We might always love them, but we would not be doing them or ourselves justice if we did not also accept that things can and must be allowed to change.</p>
<p>(iii) Knowing why we are here</p>
<p>With clarity around the existential aims of friendship, we can be liberated to love and appreciate our remaining friends more intensely than ever before. We can acquire a newly focused perspective on what could best be done with those we identify as central to our evolution. In an unobtrusive way, we can identify what we should be trying to accomplish together, who they hope we can be for them, the important needs they are answering to in us and the virtues required for our mutual growth. It isn’t a betrayal of a friendship to be operating with this kind of awareness; it may be the best way to make sense of its essential benefits.</p>
<p>(iv) Imagining ideal friends</p>
<p>The more we know what friendship is for, the more liberated we can be to identify what gaps remain in our social lives and we can imagine what sort of friends we would ideally acquire going forward. We might not always be able to secure them, but knowing what kind of people they would be – the strengths and qualities we would want them to have – can give us a valuable map of the emotional ingredients we are in need of.</p>
<p>In freewheeling moments, we could dare to ask ourselves who our future friends would be if there were no practical obstacles in the way; if time, money, geography, contacts and status were no matter. This could sound like an adolescent fantasy, a spur to unrealistic scenarios (a great footballer, a famous actor, etc.). But there might be a serious side to our daydreams too. We might – by focusing on the question – realise that we would love to get to know someone who worked with their hands or someone who spent a lot of time in their mind; someone who knew how money operated or someone who paid attention to the movements of the psyche; someone in the arts from Ghana or someone in politics from Finland.</p>
<p>We may with such a map – at the very least – know better what we are scanning the horizon for. A clearer hold on the purpose and art of friendship opens up an intriguing additional minor possibility: that we have already met certain of our future best friends. It’s just that we have overlooked them until now because we didn’t yet know ourselves well enough.</p>
<p>(v) Less lonely with loneliness</p>
<p>A better understanding of loneliness should ultimately bring us into a less punitive relationship to our present isolation. We may not have access to anyone especially enriching or nurturing tonight or any time soon. But there should be no grounds for despair or self-hatred in this. Some of the finest people who ever lived have been here before. Isolation is no sign of degeneracy or error, but merely of an unwillingness to compromise on the elevated purposes of authentic social connections. The true appreciators of friendship will – almost by necessity – often be on their own.</p>
<p>While we wait, we may have the benefit of a dog, a stuffed animal, a god or, perhaps, an interesting book written by someone who themselves lacked friends. We can look at pictures, dialogue with a machine or put together the ideal dinner party. What matters is that we do not allow our solitude to sink our spirits. We can feel reconciled to our own company because we finally know – and so can properly and calmly anticipate – what true and fulfilling togetherness will one day be like.</p>
