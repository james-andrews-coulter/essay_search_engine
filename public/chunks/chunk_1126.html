        <h2>Omo</h2>
<p>We know that what we should really have are siends: that what we really need iS A project, that what we really would be touch and that what would properly revive us is love. But those fine and beautiful things are not — in the actual conditions of life always necessarily readily available. And that is why, in the fallen world we actually inhabit, it is a notable piece of good fortune that we can every now and then go and visit a place like Ayumu’s restaurant in a tangle of streets just south of Shinjuku Station in Tokyo.
The restaurant has been there for ten years and we’ve known about it for three. It seats fifteen at the bar and a further twenty in small, quiet tables at the back. It’s normally Yoshi or her daughter Fumiko who come and take our order. The menu changes regularly Ayumu handwrites it himself and specials of the day go on a board by the grill. There’s no particular theme, it’s whatever takes their fancy or happens to be in season. Yoshi is patient and, despite the bustle, makes us feel she has time; she understands that this might be a bit more difficult for us than for the others. The tamagoyaki is delicious; apparently this could be an evening to try out the sukiyaki. Or what about a heart-warming nikujaga, an idea which somehow makes Yoshi laugh a little and touch ourarm in a maternal way (she can tell that we might be in need of beef, potatoes and some Yegetables simmered for a few hours in a soy, sake and mirin sauce a kindly dish for someone for whom not everything has gone right).

A beer or some water? Perhaps some cold The questions are compact and clear. No One In this place asks anything that we can’t answer; they don’t cross-examine our thoughts and they never disagree with our choices. They don’t ask us to take responsibility or lift our game, or suggest we take a long hard look at Ourselves right now and stop pretending. They Just wonder if we might fancy some edamame as well? sake?
Money obviously cannot buy us what we truly want: the sincere regard of those we live among, a chance to contribute to the welfare of others, a sense that we are understood. But it can, at difficult points, at least buy us a few symbols of considerateness, and sometimes that might be the very best we can hope for, and that is realistically available to us, in our distinctly bathetic and radically imperfect lives. We do not always have the inner resources to find a meal the trivial thing it probably is.
A restaurant won’t directly solve any of our deeper problems: it can’t guide us through the maddening complexities of our domestic arrangements or help us build a satisfying career. What it can do is provide us with a muchneeded degree of consolation. Here, we can be looked after for a couple of hours in a way we perhaps last knew as children when competent, kindly adults took it upon themselves to try to make us happy. Even as we battle through the trickier days of our lives, we’re never too far from a quiet table and a menu and Yoshi waiting with artfully feigned patience to take our order.</p>
