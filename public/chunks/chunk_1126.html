<p>How to make a home under the table.</p>
<p>A bedroom camp</p>
<p>When I was a child I used to play a game. I’d take all my bedroom furniture and move it around. Then I’d drape it with blankets and bed sheets, so that within my
  room, I’d constructed another one, rather like a Bedouin tent. Then I’d crawl in, and lie there on the floor, and eat a midnight feast in the camp I’d created for myself.</p>
<p>It drove my parents mad: not least because there I was crunching crisps long after my bedtime; not least, I might add, because the camp was child-sized and they couldn’t get into it to
  extract me. Instead, they’d stand at the door and shout at me to return everything to its proper place and get into mine – my bed.</p>
<p>It always felt unfair. I wasn’t really doing anything they’d never done. After all, when we’d moved in a matter of months before, they had done much the same thing, unloading
  furniture, and moving it into empty rooms, and moving it around, and moving it around again until they said they were happy to settle in.</p>
<p>Just like them, I had taken a generic architectural box and turned it into a world of my own that fitted me more precisely. Within a house, just as they had, I had made a home. They didn’t
  see it that way, of course. ‘There’s a place for everything,’ they said, and they made me put everything back in its place.</p>
<p>I suspect most of us have an inner parent that agrees with them, and an inner child that would rather make a camp. After all, the architecture of a house is only just the beginning of a home.
  Dining rooms only become dining rooms once a table and chairs are set out in the middle of them and sitting rooms only when the sofa arrives. Bedrooms are, in English anyway, named for a piece of
  furniture. Buildings without furniture are empty vessels. They only become homes once we furnish them to suit our specific needs.</p>
<p>Deck the hall</p>
<p>There’s nothing naughty about it, really: I was only doing something that everyone has been doing for years. Up until the eighteenth century in Edinburgh, for example,
  rooms in ordinary houses weren’t even given names. They were either called ‘rooms’, ‘fire rooms’ (that is to say they had a fireplace in them), ‘garrets’,
  ‘closets’ or ‘cellars’. Only once these rooms were furnished did they acquire a function, and then only temporarily, until the furniture within them was rearranged and the
  function changed once again.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, remember, houses consisted of nothing more than one room: a hall with a fire in the middle of the floor. It fell to furniture temporarily arranged within it to articulate what
  was actually going to happen there. Just as I did with my childhood camp, large households would camp out in the great hall, arranging benches and tables and tapestries to cordon off areas for
  private functions and public meetings.</p>
<p>Little tents of tapestry, for example, would be contrived under the hammer-beam roofs to create islands of quiet amid the melee: around beds, or places for women. Important people would sit on
  thrones separated from the rest of the room by the use of parquets, literally ‘little parks’ of precious material arranged on the floor, or by canopies suspended overhead. The servants
  whose job it was to rig them up were known as upholsterers.</p>
<p>These usages survive today in the figures of speech we associate with the practice of the law and business. British legal advocates are called to the bar, which was once, literally, a wooden bar
  set up to divide the ordinary functions of the hall from judicial meetings. Judges sit on the ‘bench’, although that particular piece of furniture has long since been replaced by a more
  comfortable chair. Indeed, chairs themselves were so unusual in the Middle Ages that the only person who was allowed to sit in one in any hall was the chairman of the board, which was, in those
  days, an actual board, mounted on trestles, around which business meetings were held.</p>
<p>The architecture of the hall might have been shedlike, but once it was furnished, it made a model of social order that stretched all the way from the beggar standing at the door to the chairman
  of the board sitting in his throne at the high table at the other end of the room. Above the king’s throne in the Great Hall in Winchester Castle was painted the same wheel of fortune to
  which both beggar and lord, both high and low, were bound, as if to remind both of them that their positions might switch with one capricious turn.</p>
<p>The hierarchical patterns these arrangements of furniture made were much more permanent than the furniture itself, little of which survives. Go to important state occasions at Westminster Hall
  in London today, and you’ll find the Queen sitting in precisely the same place (if not in exactly the same chair) her ancestors have sat in for centuries. There’s only one time the
  monarch was ever asked to sit anywhere else, and that was during the trial of Charles I, in which representatives of the people sat in the place of the throne, and the king sat in their usual
  place, as the accused. They executed him.</p>
<p>‘There should be a place for everything, and everything should be in its place,’ we say, and the saying applies as equally to modern homes as to medieval great halls. If an
  unfurnished room is an empty box, and a furnished one the precise reflection of its particular function, then it stands to reason: if you want to know how to furnish a home properly, you’ll
  need to know where everything, and everyone, is going to go.</p>
<p>In the last chapter, we started with the idea of the individual house as an archetype of selfhood, stability and order. We discovered, however, that like many archetypes such a house is a myth:
  few of us build ourselves individual homes. Instead we make do, making ourselves at home in all sorts of buildings that were built long before we ever encountered them.</p>
<p>The means we use to occupy them are rarely architectural. Instead, like the upholsterers of the Middle Ages or myself as a child, we rearrange the furniture and build a camp.</p>
<p>A machine for living in</p>
<p>No writer on the home could have been less medieval than that irascible prophet of modern architecture Le Corbusier; but he was quite as much a stickler for domestic order as
  his ancestors. It was he who coined the idea that the house is ‘a machine for living in’,1 and in his treatise of 1923, ‘Towards a
  New Architecture’, he compared the home to that most modern of machines of his time, the aeroplane.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an aesthetic comparison: Le Corbusier didn’t want houses to look like planes or machines. The lesson of the aeroplane, he argued, didn’t lie in what it looked like,
  but rather in the way in which its design solved a particular problem no one had ever thought of before. People had been able to fly since the Montgolfier brothers launched their hot-air balloon in
  1783, but they hadn’t been able to control where they were going to go.</p>
<p>The aeroplane, with its directional body and wings, changed all that. ‘When a problem is properly stated, in our epoch, it inevitably finds its solution’,2 wrote Le Corbusier. The inventors of the aeroplane, he observed, had created their wonderful new machine by asking themselves what it was for, rather than what it should
  look like.</p>
<p>The problem of the house, he continued, was that the reverse had happened: everyone knew what home should look like; but no one had really thought about what it was for. Look at Victorian
  houses, with their turrets and their clutter, think of our child’s drawing, and it’s all too easy to see what he was talking about.</p>
<p>‘Let us shut our eyes to what exists,’3 he commanded; and he described what he thought home was for: ‘a receptacle for light and
  sun . . . a surface over which one can walk at ease, a bed on which to stretch yourself, a chair in which to rest or work, a work table, receptacles in which each thing can be put at once in its
  right place.’4 It’s a disarmingly simple vision.</p>
<p>Just like an aeroplane, which needs to be as light as possible to stay in the air, the components of Le Corbusier’s modern home were minimized: ‘Demand bare walls in your bedroom,
  your living room and your dining room,’ he commanded, ‘built-in fittings to take the place of much of the furniture, which is expensive to buy, takes up too much room, and needs looking
  after . . . Buy only practical furniture and never buy decorative “pieces”. If you want to see bad taste, go into the houses of the rich.’5</p>
<p>And just as with the moving parts of any efficient machine, Le Corbusier also believed that, in this house, there should be a place for everything, and that everything should be kept in its
  place. ‘Never undress in your bedroom,’ he commanded. ‘It is not a clean thing to do and makes the room horribly untidy . . . demand fitments for your linen and clothing, not more
  than 5 feet in height, with drawers, hangers etc. . . . Keep your odds and ends in drawers or cabinets.’6</p>
<p>The furniture of the modern home was conceived as the working parts of a machine; and Le Corbusier’s own designs for furniture certainly fit the bill. Constructed of black leather and
  tubular chrome-plated steel, they have all the charming whimsy of surgical equipment. The modern home, it seems, had all the military discipline and mechanical efficiency that Le Corbusier so
  admired in the aeroplanes of World War I.</p>
<p>Even that mythologist of Hearth and Home, Frank Lloyd Wright, agreed and in a rare, reflective, rueful moment, he admitted that his skills as an architect did not stretch to the design or the
  arrangement of furniture:</p>
<p>I soon found it difficult, anyway, to make some of the furniture in the ‘abstract’; that is, to design it as architecture and make it human at the same time
      – fit for human use. I have been black and blue in some spot, somewhere, almost all my life from too intimate contacts with my own furniture.7</p>
<p>Furniture, however efficient, ordered, machinelike, built-in, or coordinated, possesses, as we shall see, a life of its own. Like all machines, the ‘machine for living
  in’ is bound to go wrong.</p>
<p>You are the ghost in the machine</p>
<p>And that’s where the fun starts.</p>
<p>Mon Oncle, Jacques Tati’s 1958 film, begins so well. It all starts in a designer home, in a designer suburb, where, apparently, everything runs as smoothly as a machine,
  there’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place.</p>
<p>It is morning. A housewife comes to the front door of a modern house, carrying a feather duster. Her besuited husband and her uniformed son are standing there, and before she kisses them
  goodbye, she dusts them down. They drive off in a designer car to the factory and the school, and she, clad in a hygienic housecoat, sets about cleansing their antiseptic dwelling with a vacuum
  cleaner of the most modern design. It all begins so well: with a mechanical Corbusian dream.</p>
<p>But then the eponymous uncle appears. He has a job in his brother-in-law’s factory, but somehow, he can’t get the machine he is employed to oversee to work. While it should be
  producing perfect plastic piping, he somehow manages to get it to spit out sausage links with knots, and twists, bulges and kinks so egregious that the machine itself eventually gives up in a cloud
  of steam, and the factory grinds to a halt. Uncle isn’t good with machines, you see.</p>
<p>He’s not much good with order altogether. At the end of the day, he picks his nephew up from school; and instead of taking him straight back to his hygienic home, he takes him off to play
  with some filthy street kids on a piece of waste ground. It is only several hours later that they appear back at the house, the little boy smeared in chocolate, knees covered in mud. His mother
  stands him on a mat and vacuums him down before she lets him back into the house.</p>
<p>And that’s when the fun starts. You see, Uncle can’t resist poking around his sister’s modern machine of a home: jumping back, startled, as cabinets fly open in response to
  motion sensors, playing curiously with the unbreakable plastic utensils until, of course, he drops one on the floor, and it proves to be the one breakable object in the whole kitchen. Exiled
  outside, he prunes the geometric topiary in the garden until there’s nothing left of it, and, breaking the fountain, brings chaos to an elegant tea party his sister has so carefully
  arranged.</p>
<p>It’s all too much for all of them. At the end of the day, our uncle tips an uncomfortable modernist sofa on its side, and falls asleep on it, his snores echoing round the clinical house as
  if it were the most comfortable chaise longue in the world. The next morning, he is sent back to where he came from, so that he can do no more damage to their ordered, efficient lives.</p>
<p>And that’s where the fun finally starts. You see, Uncle doesn’t live in a machine. Instead, he follows the stray dogs through a crack in the wall that surrounds the neat suburbs, and
  finds himself in the middle of town. The streets are filthy: the street sweeper is too busy chatting with passersby to keep them clean. The town square is crowded with a pleasingly aimless crowd of
  maiden aunts, irascible postmen, unruly schoolboys, and flirtatious ingénues, all not going about their business, whatever business that might be, if any at all.</p>
<p>And so the uncle enters a decrepit apartment building, and ascends to his garret up a staircase of bewildering, tortuous, and, of course, inefficient complexity. Just as he reaches the top of
  the staircase, he leans over to open a window by his front door that stands slightly ajar. A patch of light moves on the crumbling wall; there’s a birdcage hanging there, and as the light
  moves, the bird contained within it begins to sing.</p>
<p>It’s a tiny adjustment – designed by no one, imagined by no one, the result of a coincidental accident. It’s a mechanical movement, to be sure, but not part of the machinery of
  a home ever imagined by a Corbusier or a Wright.</p>
<p>Homes aren’t just machines, and what they contain – the lives we lead in them – can’t be manufactured as if they were. In fact, as suggested by Mon Oncle’s little
  window or the sofa which is much more comfortable once it is upended on its side, things often work best when they are not being used for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>
<p>Sometimes furniture is at its most effective when there isn’t a place for everything, and everything isn’t in its place. After all, furniture is the thing that allows us to make the
  rooms of our houses do all sorts of things they were never originally intended to. Furniture isn’t just there to fulfil functions, or to solve problems: it can restate them too, just as the
  aeroplane once restated the problem of flight.</p>
<p>Meubles and immeubles</p>
<p>It’s something our medieval ancestors knew, setting up camp as they did in their draughty halls, centuries ago; and their attitude survives in the modern word for
  furniture in many European languages: meubles in French and mobili in Italian, for example. ‘Moveable’, the words mean, in distinction to the fixed, immeuble
  buildings that will house them.</p>
<p>Furniture is mobile in two dimensions. Firstly, and most obviously, we can move furniture around within the home.</p>
<p>Furniture allows us to repurpose spaces without knocking down a single wall; and it allows us to do it in minutes. In the eighteenth century, for example, light and elegant chairs would be
  arranged around the walls of rooms and were only taken out when needed. As a result, rooms could take on diverse functions in a single day. There was no necessity to describe them as anything other
  than ‘rooms’.</p>
<p>Things only started to change in the nineteenth century: there’s an account of a house whose owners had subscribed to the novel fad of leaving the furniture out in the middle of the room,
  permanently. One guest was so outraged he complained about the lazy servants who hadn’t moved it to its proper place against the walls. By the time of Le Corbusier’s manual, furniture
  was something that should be built-in.</p>
<p>It reminds me, a little, of the camps I used to build when I was a child – and of my parents’ impatience with them. Like Mon Oncle, I was removing things from their proper places,
  arranging them as they weren’t intended to be arranged, and using them for things they weren’t meant to be used for. Furniture, of its nature, invites disobedience, misuse, and
  play.</p>
<p>My parents shouldn’t have been displeased. They were doing exactly the same thing: with the chair in the bedroom that had become an impromptu hanger for the laundry they’d only worn
  once and didn’t want to put in the wash; when they stood on the kitchen table to change the light bulb; or went to sleep on the sofa on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t have been angry. After all, it was easy enough to move everything back again, and, what is more, that is exactly what they were doing downstairs: moving the sofas back
  against the walls when there was a party, grabbing a mismatched chair to make up numbers around the table at dinner, or carrying the deckchairs and an old card table outside into the garden when it
  was sunny.</p>
<p>Home on the move</p>
<p>But furniture doesn’t just get moved around within the home, it is moved from home to home too.</p>
<p>Medieval households lived on the road, moving every few months to another castle or hall in search of food, or military advantage. Everyone would come: they’d take their family, and their
  servants, and their clothes; but they’d also take all their furniture. Sometimes they even took the windows: the glass in them was so precious that, often, they could only afford one set.
  They’d arrive at some fortress or other, their upholsterers would get to work with poles and tapestries, benches and tables, and soon enough, a bare stone shell would be transformed into a
  habitable home. When the lord left, it would disappear along with him.</p>
<p>In fact any furniture that remained behind – sometimes the throne, for example, or the table of judgement that stood before it – was so unusual that it would be made of marble, and
  given a special name – dormant – to refer to the fact that it didn’t move.</p>
<p>More of us are cuckoos than blackbirds. Just as very few of us actually design and build our nests, but instead, occupy ones made by and for others, so very few of us could claim to live in
  homes for which our furniture was designed. Instead, we make use of the furniture we already have, and which we have brought with us from the other homes we have occupied before.</p>
<p>Adolf Loos admired the practice: ‘An English bride would most of all like to take her parents’ furniture with her. Here in Vienna brides are deaf to the suggestion that they would
  make things financially easier for their parents if they took over something of their furniture. They want to have something “new”, “fashionable”, “modern”. They
  even want something “artist designed”.’8</p>
<p>Like Loos’s English brides, most of us, I suspect, carry our furniture with us from house to house. My kitchen table is an old door, nicked from the art college where I work. The chairs
  around it were ordered online, and arrived in the mail. The old armchair that sits facing them in the kitchen is something I inherited from my grandmother, and she from hers. It has probably sat in
  around ten sitting rooms along the way. I drove it up here in a white van two years ago.</p>
<p>Like an English bride’s, my home is neither new, nor fashionable, nor artist designed; but it is mine. Through the medium of furniture, my kitchen – once upon a time a generic box
  designed in the 1950s by the City of Edinburgh council for the generic Edinburgh council-house tenant – has been transformed by a collage of things old, new and borrowed, if not blue, into
  something which could have been created by no one else but me.</p>
<p>Forty years on, I’m still camping out at home.</p>
<p>Home is a camp</p>
<p>Homes are, like the tents erected in medieval great halls or my impromptu bedroom camp, temporary affairs, hasty arrangements, attempts to customize the more permanent
  architecture we live in to serve our own particular purposes. As those purposes change, so do the pieces of furniture that articulate them within the rooms of our homes.</p>
<p>But it moves in another way too. Our ancestors, the very distant ones, wandering German forest or American prairie or Asiatic steppe, were all nomads once, and now, centuries later, as we flit
  from perch to perch in the cities of the contemporary world, we still are. Like them, even when we’re at home, we move home around with us.</p>
<p>It is, I hope, a liberating proposition. As Loos put it:</p>
<p>It is ridiculous to lay down to people where a thing should stand, design everything for them from the lavatory pan to the ashtray. On the contrary, I like people to move
      their furniture around so that it suits them (not me!), and it is quite natural (and I approve) when they bring the old pictures and mementos they have come to love into a new interior,
      irrespective of whether they are good taste or bad.9</p>
<p>Making home on the move: tables and chairs set out at an Airstream trailer gathering, 1961.</p>
<p>Furniture is the first of the devices we use to occupy the permanent buildings in which we make our temporary homes. Furniture is, and allows us to be, disobedient, contingent,
  playful and irreverent, subverting and individualizing the order of houses in order to make ourselves at home. This is a continuous process of readjustment, as capricious, as changeable, as we
  are.</p>
<p>Home isn’t something we build: it is something we bring with us.</p>
