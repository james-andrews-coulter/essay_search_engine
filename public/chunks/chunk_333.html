        <h3>5 Keeping it local</h3>
<p>Architects once had no option but to build in materials that were natural and local. This had two advantages. First, as a general rule, one cannot go very wrong with natural materials. You have to try very hard to make an ugly stone or wood building; it’s difficult to build very high in them for a start, so your eyesore is guaranteed a certain modesty. And the inherent organic beauty of timber and limestone, granite or marble attenuates any errors at the level of form. Second, it can help to orient us and connect us to particular places if they don’t look like they could be anywhere on the planet, if Jerusalem is built in one sort of stone and Bath in another.</p>
<p>But modernity introduced glass and steel, out of which large and imposing structures could quickly be formed, and it suggested that it would be as daft to have local architecture as it would be to have local phone or bicycle design. The argument once again forgot about human nature. When we say that a building looks like it ‘could be anywhere’, we’re not praising its global ambitions, we’re expressing a longing for a building to remind us of where we are.</p>
