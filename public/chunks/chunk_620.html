        <h2>QUESTIONING OUR STORIES</h2>
<p>We tend to be imprisoned by a set of stories and judgments that we repeat to ourselves without even noticing how partial, and usually unfair, they are to us, and how open they might be to being questioned and nuanced. For example, we may tell ourselves: Respectable people don’t have those sorts of sexual urges, or Good jobs are always unenjoyable, or No really good person would ever want to leave this kind of relationship, or, more bluntly and definitively, You are an ugly failure.</p>
<p>We may not even know we’re carrying such narrow and punitive notions within us, but a good therapist will identify them and gently probe at their logic, opening a sanity-restoring degree of space in our imaginations. They will raise new possibilities with us: Might it not be OK to want something different sexually? Why not contemplate leaving a job that is evidently making us miserable? Must this relationship be for ever? And why? Is it really true that we have never done anything with our lives? Might we not be deserving and attractive?</p>
<p>We may never have revealed to anyone the peculiar arguments that reverberate inside us and make us feel so hemmed in. But speaking these arguments aloud to an outsider can help us to see their absurdity and cruelty—and ultimately break their unwarranted spell over us.</p>
