        <h4>1. They confess it</h4>
<p>Fed up at last, you tell them that you’ve had enough of the violence, affairs, addiction, over-spending, distance, lack of intimacy, lack of sex … Instead you proffer an ultimatum. If they don’t raise their game, you will leave (even though of course that’s the last thing you really want; you love this person!).</p>
<p>You may be shaking and flushed after you have spoken. You’re feeling you might be crazy (surely it’s crazy to threaten to leave someone you love and who says they love you). You had expected all sorts of dark responses on their part. But something that appears lovely now happens. They admit it! They confess! They say, ‘My goodness you’re right! I hadn’t really fully realised until now, until you finally opened my eyes to how I’ve harmed you. Baby, I hear you! Baby, I’m so sorry!’</p>
<p>The person promises that they will change. They just need a little bit of time; they need your understanding. They suggest getting a therapist, once a month or so, to get on top of their issues. Their ready candour is moving and suggests they have a handle on their psyches. You are, in any case, desperate to believe them, so they have a willing audience.</p>
<p>The problem is that, despite their promises, the person doesn’t change. They make a short-term adjustment, enough to ensure you won’t leave them in the timescale you were threatening, but not profound enough to correct the problem – or allow you your freedom.</p>
<p>In the gap between their promise to change and your realisation that they don’t have the ability (or perhaps intention) to do so, children may have been born (they wanted kids to keep you around; you wanted them as a token of the happy future that was being promised). Commitments pile up and there are fewer options left in the world beyond. You might not be so young any more.</p>
