        <h3>6. Capitalism</h3>
<p>Economies look as if they are driven by huge material elements, as if they are about oil fields, communications satellites, huge retail complexes and vast entertainment districts. But behind these impressive factors, the economy is, to an extraordinary extent, a psychological phenomenon driven by our collective appetites, imaginations and longings. What we call capitalism is, in the end, the result of the way our minds work.</p>
<p>Up till now, capitalism has tended to focus on supplying our more basic needs. The School of Life is interested in a kind of capitalism that can target higher needs: that is, a capitalism that is as efficient at meeting our needs for understanding as for sweet things to eat; that is as great at helping us live wisely as it is adept at uniting us with the ideal confectionery or garment.</p>
<p>The task is to expand the economy so as to help it engage with humanity’s real internal issues, which have usually lain outside the area of commerce as commonly defined.</p>
