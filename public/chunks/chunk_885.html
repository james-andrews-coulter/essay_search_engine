        <h3>Good listening isn’t literal</h3>
<p>What a person wants us to hear is seldom exactly what they have said. Think of a frustrated child who says they want to ‘kill their teacher’. We know that they aren’t hatching a murderous plot, they are just finding the most charged terms in which to express how frustrated they feel with someone who dominates their days and ruins their chances of having fun.</p>
<p>The same applies to a partner’s more extreme statements. They may, at an instant of maximum distress, say that they hate us, that they wish they’d never met us and that we have ruined their entire lives. It may seem trite to point this out, but almost always – if we are lucky – this is not quite what they mean. Their actual intent lies somewhat to the side of the actual words they are using.</p>
<p>What they say</p>
<p>What they mean</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>Reassure me that you still love me.</p>
<p>I loathe my job.</p>
<p>I worry I’m not good enough at the career I’ve chosen.</p>
<p>I don’t care if I see you on Saturday night or not.</p>
<p>Tell me you want to see me.</p>
<p>The true meaning has been skirted because it is too raw, too revealing and – most often – too vulnerable. It is never easy to accept how much we rely on someone we cannot control. Good listeners know they must translate from an indirect to a direct idiom – gifting their partners the intense, touching and dependent words that they have not yet had the courage to find.</p>
<p>Proper listening isn’t a natural accomplishment, it’s just incredibly nice. It is an act of the greatest kindness – a true expression of love – to allow a partner to be right when they are wrong, to lament the conduct of others when it’s partly their fault and to be volubly miserable around things that, in reality, aren’t necessarily so tragic. To listen to this means that we are attending to the subtle, complex and very real intricacies of another’s life. And secretly we hope that someone will, one day, love us enough to do the same for us.</p>
