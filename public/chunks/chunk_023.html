            <h3>2. Setting an agenda</h3>
<p>The word ‘agenda’ is not normally one we associate with ‘friendship’. The thought that a friend might have one can quickly come across as an incongruously mercenary and cynical possibility. We tend to connect agendas with attempts to increase status, raise money, steal an advantage or hoodwink others. We tend to like our friendships to be very much agenda-free.</p>
<p>Even asking what a friendship might be ‘for’ can seem odd. In an otherwise overly reductive world, we view friendship as offering a last hold-out against practical and commercial pressures. If asked, we might, with irritation, simply say that we want our friendships to be ‘for’ not very much – beyond providing that nebulous but crucial quality we know as ‘friendliness’.</p>
<p>But in our haste to escape from reductiveness, we risk drifting away from the ultimate purpose of a friendship. Whether we are conscious of it or not, friendships generally do (and should) have agendas, and the more we can get these in view, the more we can be in a position to assess a given friendship’s significance and role. It doesn’t have to contravene the ideals of friendship to occasionally ask what we are essentially trying to do with any friend we spend time with. ‘Do’ doesn’t have to involve a material or competitive move; we might be alluding to a mission to offer reassurance about backache or an exchange of views on 1970s electric guitar solos. The question doesn’t have to shatter what is precious in a friendship; it may just help us to hold it more securely in mind.</p>
<p>We can start from the fundamental idea that we need friends because we can’t carry out certain things – ranging from the practical to the emotional – on our own. Friendship is born out of our insuﬃciencies. Yet what we lack will sharply differ from person to person (and age to age). Some of us aren’t good at laughing at ourselves; others need help in adopting a more reasonable perspective; some of us need assistance in being more forgiving; others require help in growing more ruthless. Equally, there are areas in which we’re likely already to excel. We may be world masters at the art of fretting, or of worrying about our status, or of believing that everything is fine as it is.</p>
<p>The nature of the things we can’t do well alone should end up determining the sorts of friends that we would – ideally – set out to have in our lives (and conversely, the sorts of people we probably shouldn’t surround ourselves with). The agenda for our friendships should be set by our deficiencies; there are as many of these potential agendas as there are gaps in our psyches.</p>
<p>We could, in theory, spend an evening talking about almost anything with a nice person: we could shift – pleasantly enough – from what happened at work last week to where we’re planning to go on holiday to a film we happened to see the night before. We could proceed as if we had endless time and unlimited energy. But the drive to ask for an agenda is founded on a stern but vital insight: we have a bounded lifespan. And on that basis, we owe it to ourselves and our companions to work hard to zero in on the most important, thrilling, heart-warming or fruitful activities we could plausibly carry out with a particular person.</p>
<p>In one kind of friendship, a common agenda might involve trying to clarify one’s priorities in the last phase of one’s life: how much does money still matter? When might one retire? How much energy should one give to the children? Another friendship might be focused on understanding one’s relationships, or the art of Northern India, or the best way to exercise or to plant a garden. It is no injustice to the sincerity of a bond to be as clear as we can about why it exists.</p>
<p>The concept of an agenda also helps along the way to explain why at times we fail to click with someone as we might. It isn’t so much that we don’t like them; it can simply be that we can’t – in the deepest of senses – find any use for them. There is nothing they can give us that we lack and vice versa. We properly honour friendship when we accept that every friend we truly value should by rights be playing a significant role in advancing us towards the overarching goal of every life: growing into the most mature, articulate, developed and expansive version of oneself.</p>
