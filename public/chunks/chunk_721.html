            <h2>ANXIETY &amp; MODERN TIMES</h2>
<p>We’ve built a much safer and more prosperous world than our ancestors ever enjoyed, but modern times have also brought a special range of troubles into our lives that contribute to our enhanced anxiety.</p>
<p>Perfectionism</p>
<p>The modern age is ambitious. We wish to cure disease, waste no time, achieve constant happiness and live forever. These are fine hopes, but because they are necessarily still out of reach, they leave us angst-ridden, dispirited, disappointed with ourselves and angry with our societies. For most of history, people suffered greatly, but they were spared one particular agony: the sense that a perfect life could somehow be possible.</p>
<p>Individualism</p>
<p>For most of history, we lived in close-knit groups. The modern world has removed our reliance on the clan or the family and moved us to big cities where we can live privately and prosper on our own. We exist in an age of individualism. This may have liberated us in many ways, but it has also left us free to suffer alone and endure life without an anchor, feeling overly responsible for whatever befalls us and with no one to blame for our sorrows but ourselves.</p>
<p>Professional obsession</p>
<p>The modern world is fixated on work. No social encounter can pass without the question of what we ‘do’ being raised – and only with a sufficiently impressive or elevated answer do we count as a valid and interesting person. Our self-esteem hangs upon our performance in an uncertain and random economy. Being nice is not enough. It is not surprising that the first great sociologist to investigate suicide – Émile Durkheim – discovered that the more focused on work a society becomes, the more its rate of suicide rises. It is not poverty or illness as such that drive us to the ultimate act of despair – it is the sense that we don’t mean anything outside of what we’ve been able to achieve.</p>
<p>Meritocracy</p>
<p>Modern societies firmly believe in the concept of meritocracy; that is, the faith that we should be free to make a success of our lives if we have sufficient talent and energy and that there should be no obstacles to our efforts based on class, gender or race.</p>
<p>However, this very well-meaning idea carries with it some alarming implications, for if we are to believe that those at the top truly deserve their success, then those at the bottom must truly deserve their failure. Under the aegis of a meritocratic worldview, an element of justice enters into the distribution of penalties as well as rewards. We move from thinking of the poor as ‘unfortunates’, deserving of compassion and kindness, to thinking of them as something far harsher: ‘losers’.</p>
<p>A society that thinks of itself as meritocratic converts poverty from a condition of honourable, if painful, bad luck into evidence of personal incompetence. The burden of failure rises exponentially.</p>
<p>The media</p>
<p>We’re surrounded by a mass media that is hysterical, disaster-focused and vengeful in tone. It permanently gives us a sense that the outside world is extremely dangerous, that other people are mad or violent, that everyone is mean and that our societies are spiralling towards anarchy and degeneracy. Furthermore, the media holds up for ridicule and condemnation people who have made mistakes and thereby contributes to a feeling that no one ever deserves forgiveness or understanding.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<p>Nature used to play an incidental role in keeping us calm. We were never far from the perspective-giving sight of a giant vista or an unspoilt landscape. Our attention would, in the past, frequently have been drawn to non-human elements, stopping us thinking of what happened to us as the measure of all things. Nowadays, we have no such relief. We live in concrete cages surrounded by millions of our own species; we have identified humans as the most important things that exist. It’s a move that can be cast as a liberation, but it has unleashed claustrophobia and panic. There are now few established points of reference beyond us. What happens to us here and now in the city is framed as overwhelmingly important; it is all there is. And so everything that goes wrong, everything that frustrates or disappoints us, fills the horizon. The idea of something bigger, older, mightier, wiser and less known to which we owe love and attention has been stripped of its power to console us. We are seldom without our phones.</p>
