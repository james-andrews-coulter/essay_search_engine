        <h3>7 Sentimentality</h3>
<p>If it were not already so difficult, we are asked to smile continually, to have a nice day, to have fun, to cheer on holiday and to be exuberant that we are alive. Modernity has stripped us of our primordial right to feel melancholy, unproductive, surly and confused. It has done us the central injustice of insisting that happiness should be the norm. The German philosopher Theodor Adorno remarked that modern America had produced one overwhelming villain: that cheerleader-in-chief, Walt Disney.</p>
<p>Though modernity may have made us materially abundant, it has imposed a heavy emotional toll. It has alienated us, bred envy, increased shame, separated us from one another, bewildered us, forced us to grin inauthentically and left us restless and enraged.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we do not need to suffer alone. Though it presents itself to each one of us as a personal affliction, our condition is the work of an age, not of our own minds. By learning to diagnose our condition, we can come to accept that we are not so much individually demented as living in times of unusually intense and societally generated perturbance. We can accept that modernity is a kind of disease and that understanding it will be the cure.</p>
<p>Edward Hopper, Compartment C, Car 293, 1938.</p>
