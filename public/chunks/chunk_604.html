        <h3>¶ Good Enough</h3>
<p>The mid-20th-century English psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott, who specialised in working with parents and children, was disturbed by how often he encountered in his consulting rooms parents who were deeply disappointed with themselves. They felt they were failing as parents and hated themselves intensely as a result. They were ashamed of their occasional rows, their bursts of short temper, their times of boredom around their own children and their many mistakes. They were haunted by a range of anxious questions: are we too strict, too lenient, too protective, not protective enough? What struck Winnicott, however, was that these people were almost always not at all bad parents. They were loving, often very kind, and very interested in their children; they tried hard to meet their needs and to understand their problems as best they could. As parents they were – as he came to put it in a hugely memorable and important phrase – ‘good enough’.</p>
<p>Winnicott identified a crucial issue. We often torment ourselves because we have in our minds a very demanding, and in fact impossible, vision of what we’re supposed to be like across a range of areas of our lives. This vision doesn’t emerge from a careful study of what actual people are like; it’s a fantasy, a punitive perfectionism, drawn from the cultural ether.</p>
<p>When it comes to parenting, we imagine a fantasy of parents who are always calm, always perfectly wise, always there when their child needs them. There are no parents like this. But a Romantic conception of the perfect parent can fill our minds and make us deeply anxious and fretful, because our own family life inevitably looks so messy and muddled by comparison. Astonishingly and unreasonably inflated expectations leave us only able to perceive where we have fallen short.</p>
<p>With the phrase ‘good enough’, Winnicott was initiating a hugely important project. He wanted to move us away from idealisation. Ideals may sound nice, but they bring a terrible problem in their wake: they can make us despair of the merely quite good things we already do and have. ‘Good enough’ is a cure for the sickness of idealisation.</p>
<p>Winnicott introduced the idea of ‘good enough’ around parenting. But it applies widely across our lives, because we idealise around a great many different things. For example, we might refer to the ‘good enough’ job. It may not meet our fantasy demands: creative yet secure; fascinating yet unstressful; morally uplifting yet highly paid. But by the standards of what real jobs are like, it might be OK and worth taking pride in. Or we could speak of the ‘good enough’ marriage. It might not be the perfect union of two souls, sex may be intermittent, there may be regular frustrations and misunderstandings and a fair number of flare-ups. But by the standards of actual long-term relationships, that might be genuine success.</p>
<p>By dialling down our expectations, the idea of ‘good enough’ resensitises us to the lesser, but very real, virtues we already possess, but that our unreal hopes have made us overlook.</p>
<p>A ‘good enough’ life is not a bad life. It’s the best existence that actual humans are ever likely to lead.</p>
