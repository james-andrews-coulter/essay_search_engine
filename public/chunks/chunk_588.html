        <h3>¶ Envy of the Future</h3>
<p>When we look widely across the past, we can feel strange waves of compassion for the immense numbers of people who were condemned – by the sheer misfortune of when they happened to be born – to appalling varieties of suffering that are now easily avoided. Their lives might have been destroyed by an illness that can now be prevented by a shot of the cheapest vaccine; they laboured under terrifying convictions we now regard as baseless illusions. A child might die of hunger on the very land now occupied by a bountiful supermarket. Their misery was so profound, and yet, from where we stand, so preventable. They would have envied us, if they could have realised what we have.</p>
<p>But there is another thought that might emerge: that at some point a future society might look back on our mode of life with similar feelings of pity. They might hear stories of our fractious relationships, which so often end in divorce, and feel immense tenderness for our unnecessary suffering – avoided by them via careful counselling, digital head implants and inter-cranial education from birth about how to manage the complexities of life with another person. They may look sorrowfully on our working lives, in which we so rarely feel that what we are doing is truly important; or at the difficulty we have in finding and keeping true friendships; or at the regularity with which families prove disappointing.</p>
<p>When we think of envying the future, we are primed to do so in terms of technology. Future humans might be able to vacation on Mars or look youthful when they are two hundred and three. But the real poignancy may turn out to be psychological. Our successors may master the art of being somewhat less dissatisfied, angry, confused, bored and vengeful.</p>
<p>The pity we imagine they might experience for us is really an echo of the pity we should legitimately feel for ourselves. We are registering ways in which our lives are genuinely sorrowful in comparison with what they might be.</p>
<p>But the good news is that the future does not really depend on technological breakthroughs; it could, curiously and tantalisingly, start to be available now, if only we could learn to act upon the vast reserves of wisdom our species has already so carefully and so painfully accumulated.</p>
