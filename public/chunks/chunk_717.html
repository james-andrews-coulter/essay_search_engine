        <h2>Mastering Projection</h2>
<p>Imagine that we decided to carry out a curious exercise of showing a random group of people a photograph and asking them to guess what might be going on in it. The exercise might feel a little unfamiliar at first but – with some encouragement – we might soon find our respondents loosening their imaginations and coming up with a range of plausible scenarios.</p>
<p>Looking at the photograph overleaf, one person might surmise: ‘The woman we see on the right is explaining that someone has betrayed her, probably her husband. She’s appalled and hurt, and her friend is listening with sympathy. It’s terribly raw for her.’ Another might decide: ‘The two women are about to form a relationship. The woman on the left is feeling nervous, but her date is putting her at ease by talking about art, which she loves very much.’ A third could declare: ‘They’re in the north of England, it’s mid-March and they’re discussing socialism.’</p>
<p>Key to the exercise is that the photograph has deliberately been chosen because it is ambiguous – that is, it isn’t about any one thing; it has no one meaning. We can’t know what it is ‘about’, and therefore what people say is going on in it is – very usefully – likely to tell us more about who they are, what is on their minds and how their personal histories have played out than anything that might objectively have been going on when the photograph was taken.</p>
<p>Ambiguous images are a favourite of psychologists because of the light they can shed on the unconscious workings of their clients’ minds. The elaborations that respondents make when they see such images disclose a range of clues as to their underlying obsessions, hurts and desires. This is helpful because of the way our emotional warps tend to distort our perceptions of reality and so undermine us in the pursuit of our goals. Someone who has had long early experience of being belittled and humiliated by male authority may, in contact with colleagues, potential partners or friends, repeatedly and powerfully imagine that their dignity is about to come under attack and so begin shouting or throwing out random accusations. Another with a history of abandonment may read an acute danger of loss and separation into every relationship they get involved in.</p>
<p>To use the technical term, our histories create in us proclivities to ‘project’, a process whereby we ascribe to potentially innocent or undefined situations certain stories, motives and conclusions that derive from our pasts. We map our peculiarities onto reality. Our projections can make us act against our best interests in situations that warrant none of our interpretative schemes: perhaps no one is trying to do us down; perhaps no one is seeking to leave us. But, sure that they are and that we understand the disaster at play perfectly, we may flare up, make accusations and otherwise ruin what could have been a perfectly workable situation.</p>
<p>Relationships are – inevitably – filled with projections. Sometimes these run in positive directions: we are sure that someone is about to propose to us; we have a powerful impression that we are wanted and thought of as successful. At other times, the projections are more sombre. We think our partner goes to parties because they want to meet someone else; we think they stay up late because they want to avoid coming to bed with us; we think they brush their teeth very carefully because they are robotically obedient to authority. We interpret what a partner does in the light of what we think their behaviour must mean, rather than what it might actually mean.</p>
<p>An immense amount of conflict in any relationship is driven by this difficult dynamic. One partner assumes they know exactly why the other behaves as they do – why they stay silent, why they hesitate, why they get irritated, why they regularly say certain words – and the partner is left to protest (sometimes angrily, often wearily) at what is being conclusively imagined and asserted.</p>
<p>Our past is, as a rule, liable to be a highly misleading guide to what a partner is actually thinking or intending to do – for our parents or early caregivers are not solidly representative of the humans we meet in adult life. Projections can force our partners into exhaustive efforts to correct phantasms that have arisen around them. No (they hasten to tell us), they are not trying to crush our spirit. No, they have no intention of leaving. No, their exuberance isn’t a sign that they are about to lose control and drain the household budget. And no, they are not cold and cruel – simply quiet and a little reserved, in their own distinctive way.</p>
<p>We project so avidly because we have no idea that this is what we are doing. The more we can learn to see our distortions, the less inclined we will be to distort.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which we can hope to catch hold of our projections is by asking ourselves to complete a range of generalised sentences at speed – without thinking too much about how we answer:</p>
<p>•   Whenever I open up to someone, they …</p>
<p>•   Love is …</p>
<p>•   Men are …</p>
<p>•   Women are …</p>
<p>•   Because of sex …</p>
<p>•   What tends to happen in relationships is …</p>
<p>•   If someone finds me attractive, they …</p>
<p>•   If someone doesn’t earn much money …</p>
<p>•   If someone is clever …</p>
<p>Our answers will reveal some of our abstract principles; yet relationships are the precise opposite of general. They are about one particular person – a unique individual who does not deserve a narrative formed long ago in contact with, and extrapolated from, someone else.</p>
<p>The opposite of projection is curiosity – the desire to find out what someone is genuinely like. We would as lovers ideally never assume that we can know what is involved in the mind of another – and spend much of our time attempting to find out instead. We would carefully and playfully ask the partner how they felt about fidelity or sexuality or money or being late, without writing the conclusion for them, independently and often, in contradiction to their actual views. We would become humblingly aware of how much we think we know what everything means, and remember that, blessedly and helpfully, we usually don’t.</p>
