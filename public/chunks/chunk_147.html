        <h1>1. Ambivalence; or, Adversity in the Family</h1>
<p>Ours is an age deeply committed to the family. We imagine that Western culture is largely built on a conception of the affective family – the result of two individuals
  coming together because they love each other and whose love deepens and finds expression in the having of children. We tell ourselves that it is in a stable family that children have the best
  chance of starting out well in life, and we idealize the image of a couple who stay together through all of life’s vicissitudes. One of our stock conceptions here is of the old couple on the
  doorstep of their home, waving goodbye to the children and grandchildren after a pleasant Sunday spent together. No politician could openly criticize the family and get away unscathed, and those
  politicians who are in favour of letting gay couples bring up children or wish to defend the rights of single parents nearly always support their view by saying that these are merely alternative or
  new forms of the family.</p>
<p>But the reality, as we all know, is much less tidy than the standard images suggest. The family, much as we want it to be a place of calm and security that nurtures us, is often far from that.
  It can often be a scene of conflict and even violence, and much that goes on in it can be dreadful and painful, leaving psychological damage for life. We all have to learn to live with this and
  make something of it, and in this chapter I aim to explore a little how we might do that. I investigate things mainly from the point of view of children in their relationship with their
  parents.</p>
<p>Happy and Unhappy Families</p>
<p>In his book Thoughts on Happiness, Alain (Émile-Auguste Chartier) tells us that there are two kinds of people: those who seek to silence others and those who get
  used to the noise others make. They each search out their own kind, and for this reason, he says, there are two kinds of family.</p>
<p>There are some families in which it is tacitly agreed that anything that upsets one member is forbidden to all the others. One person dislikes the smell of flowers, another,
      loud voices; one insists on silence in the evening, the other in the morning. This person does not want anyone to mention religion, that person finds his teeth set on edge by talk of politics.
      Each recognizes that they all have a right of ‘veto’; all avail themselves of this right imperiously . . . This makes for a dreary peace and an irritated happiness.</p>
<p>There are other families where the whims of each are sacred, loved, and where it never occurs to anyone that his delight could be annoying to the others . . . These are egoists. (Propos
      sur le bonheur: 83–4)</p>
<p>We all know what Alain is talking about, and we might find a complement to what he says in Tolstoy’s famous first sentence of Anna Karenina: ‘All happy
  families resemble one another; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way’. This could mean many things. One interpretation is that there is little to say about a happy family – and
  much to say about an unhappy one. Some confirmation of this is found in Edmund Gosse’s story of his childhood and his relationship with this father. In Father and Son he recalls many
  of the difficulties of his relationship with his father, who oppressed him with an intolerant and dogmatic religious outlook, but he tells us that on one occasion he spent time with the family of
  his cousins and was at ease and happy. Yet, he says, he can recall little of what he actually did whilst staying with his relatives:</p>
<p>This long visit to my cousins . . . must have been very delightful: I am dimly aware that it was: yet I remember but few of its incidents. My memory, so clear and vivid
      about earlier solitary times, now in all this society becomes blurred and vague . . . [O]f this little happy breathing-space I have nothing to report . . . [Here was] a brief interval of
      healthy, happy child-life, when my hard-driven soul was allowed to have, for a little while, no history. (Father and Son: 47)</p>
<p>Of course, we do often remember good times, but Gosse’s point alerts us to the fact that usually we are not puzzled by pleasure and happiness, and hence not
  especially driven to reflection on them, not least because when we are happy we are simply absorbed in what we are doing and the mind meets no resistance whose nature it wishes to fathom, perhaps
  in order to remove it. We accept happiness when it is there; it does not raise problems for us. Hence, we are not really very good at distinguishing the different kinds of happy family.
  However, Alain is easily able to distinguish two kinds of unhappy family, and gives us the sense that part of the problem in each case is that of living in an extreme. He shows us that
  finding peace and contentment in the family – as elsewhere – is about learning to be a kind of tightrope walker, balancing acrobatically in such a way that not only does one not fall
  but one retains one’s balance with grace.</p>
<p>Balancing Acts</p>
<p>In the first volume of Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, Marcel, the narrator, describes a scene, a moment, one evening in his young life, that has much to tell us
  about family life – and about why achieving that graceful balance is so difficult.</p>
<p>Marcel’s mother is in the habit of coming to his bedroom to say goodnight and give him a kiss. On the evening in question, however, when M. Swann, a friend of Marcel’s parents, is
  with the family for dinner, Marcel is sent to bed before the adults are to eat, and, just as he is about to kiss his mother, the bell for dinner rings and the opportunity escapes him. Marcel goes
  up to bed, wretched. He conceives a plan to send down the maid, Françoise, with a note to his mother asking her to come up to see him. He tells Françoise that his mother wanted him to
  send a message about some object she had asked him to look for – he does not want to admit the true reason for sending the note. Françoise probably does not believe him, but hands over
  the message anyway. Marcel’s mother sends back word to him: ‘There is no reply’. Devastated, Marcel decides to wait up in his room and waylay his mother later when she goes to
  bed.</p>
<p>The grace and balance of the tightrope walker have much to teach us about the attitude we should adopt to family relations.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the evening, he hears Swann leaving. Then he hears his mother ascending the stairs. He goes out from his room to meet her. She is astonished to see him – and angry. He
  implores her to come and say goodnight to him in his bedroom, but she simply tells him: ‘Run, run, so that at least your father won’t see you waiting here as if you had gone mad’.
  Both Marcel and his mother know that Marcel’s father would be highly likely to see the boy’s behaviour as feeble and self-indulgent. But it is too late: Marcel’s father is already
  on the stairs and sees what is going on. To the surprise of both, however, Marcel’s father, seeing that he is overwrought, tells his wife to go with the boy and to have a bed made up for
  herself in his room: she should spend the night with him. She objects, not wanting to give in to Marcel’s hypersensitive nature – both his parents are aware that it is only doubtfully
  good for him, for his future, that Marcel be so extraordinarily acute about such things. But she has the bed made up.</p>
<p>‘I should have been happy: I was not,’ reports Marcel. He goes on:</p>
<p>As it seemed to me, my mother had just made her first concession to me, which she must have found painful: for the first time she had given up on the ideal that she had
      devised for me, and it was the first time that she, otherwise so courageous, had had to admit defeat. It seemed to me that, if I had just been victorious, it was over her, that, if I had
      achieved what only illness, sorrow or age should have achieved – a loosening of her will, a bending of her judgement – then this evening was the beginning of an era, would remain as
      a sad date. (À la recherche du temps perdu I: Du côté de chez Swann: 38)</p>
<p>There are, I think, two key things that we can learn from this. The first is that Marcel has grasped, fully grasped for the first time, that his mother is someone else, that
  she has her own life, that the centre of her consciousness is not his. She is the source or centre of all that is good in his life – the missed goodnight kiss is a synecdoche for that,
  expresses it in compressed form. But when she withholds herself from him, as she does when she does not come to see him in his bedroom, Marcel realizes that this goodness is not in his control,
  that it can be withdrawn from him in an instant. It is not just that his mother’s failure to come to see him makes him feel wretched; it is that Marcel understands how intensely fragile is
  his hold on the things in this world that nourish him.</p>
<p>The second important thing in this episode is the fact that, when Marcel gets what he wants, he is not happy. He is not happy because when his mother comes to him she seems changed, because he
  has made her come to him. What he wanted was for her to come to him of her own accord, without any constraint on his part. In gaining his victory over her he has changed her, however
  subtle that change might be. A chasm thus opens up for Marcel and it separates him from his own desire. We normally think that there is nothing more characteristic of us than the desires we have:
  my desire to write this book, for example, is in many ways deeply expressive of the person I am – I can hardly imagine my life without my ever-recurrent desire to read, to reflect, to learn,
  to write – and we all have patterns of desire that seem typical of us as individuals. But Marcel is separated from his own desire: he gets what he wants and it makes him unhappy.</p>
<p>Someone might say, by way of objection: Marcel did not get what he wanted, because he wanted his mother to come to him unchanged. But this is to miss the point about Marcel’s desire. He
  really did get what he wanted, but he did not really understand what it was that he wanted. Our desires are often like this: we realize, once they are satisfied, what it was that we had actually
  been wanting all along, because before the satisfaction of the desire we had not understood the price we would have to pay. It was not that we had not really wanted whatever we desired; it was that
  we had not understood the nature of our own desire. Of course, this is not to deny that one can satisfy a desire and then realize that one did not really want whatever it was at all. But
  Marcel’s case is of the more subtle variety already described.</p>
<p>Ambivalent Feelings</p>
<p>Marcel discovers that the experience of desire is always implicitly or potentially traumatic. In particular, he discovers that his desire for his mother is traumatic.
  Melanie Klein, the psychoanalyst, might put the point in terms of ambivalence: what Marcel discovers is that he can feel hostile towards that which is the source of goodness – his
  mother – precisely because that source can be withheld from him. He has to learn to bear the independence from him of that which is good in life, and he has to learn to bear the ambivalence
  of his feelings about that source. For Klein, being grown up is in large part about being able to negotiate those feelings of ambivalence engendered by the very recognition in question.</p>
<p>Part of Marcel’s problem, of course, is that he comes to see his mother as limited. According to Sigmund Freud, in his short but very powerful essay ‘Family Romances’,
  and in a series of thoughts echoed in the work of Klein, this is one of the most deeply painful moments in life. The child starts out, he says, believing his parents to be ‘his only authority
  and the source of all he believes in. However,’ Freud goes on,</p>
<p>as the child develops intellectually he cannot help gradually getting to know the category to which his parents belong. He gets to know other parents, compares them with his
      own, and so becomes entitled to doubt the incomparable and unique status once attributed to them. Small events in the child’s life which induce in him a mood of dissatisfaction provide
      him with an occasion to start criticizing his parents, and the knowledge he now has, that other parents are in many respects to be preferred, allows him to support this attitude . . . The
      reason for such a reaction is obviously the feeling of being slighted. There are all too many occasions when a child is slighted, or at least feels that he has been slighted, and that he does
      not completely have his parents’ love . . . (‘Der Familienroman der Neurotiker’: 227–8)</p>
<p>The description fits Marcel perfectly.</p>
<p>Even if we do not accept all the details of their respective accounts, between them Freud and Klein put their finger on an important truth: we are pretty much all like Marcel. That is, whilst
  there may be some exceptions, in the main we all want our mother – or, more generally, our parents, and siblings if we have them; in short, our family – to give us the kind of love and
  goodness that Marcel felt so agonizingly present in that withheld goodnight kiss. The inevitable failure of our parents and siblings to give us this can make the family a scene of trouble and pain,
  even though it can be a place of warmth and security.</p>
<p>And the failure is indeed inevitable, since, as George Eliot puts it, ‘[w]e are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves’
  (Middlemarch: 243). The family is the first place where we grasp the independence of those around us. As we learn that they give us what is good but can also withdraw that goodness at any
  time – by choice or otherwise – we also learn that we are not the centre of the world, that the self must accept privation as central to its existence. The family, which seems to
  promise so much, indeed the denial of that truth, becomes the place where it is played out.</p>
<p>Idiots and Jesters</p>
<p>The truth to which these reflections point is that we never grow up. We are always potentially capable of slipping back into the mode of behaviour of the child who stamps his
  feet in anger and frustration because he does not get what he wants from his parents.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this recently when I saw a bickering couple at a railway station, on the opposite platform. Shouting at each other, they were evidently extremely angry with each other, and
  then she walked away from him, down the platform: ‘I don’t give a damn about you!’ was her message. He trailed after her, yelling at her all the while. I remembered times when, as
  a child, I would walk away from my mother in this way, damning her and yet needing her to follow after me, and I saw in this couple the repetition of a child’s reaction to his or her parent.
  And we have all, in various ways, been one member of that couple, walking off or standing watching as the other departs, aware of the idiocy of what we are doing and yet seemingly incapable of
  stopping ourselves from doing it. Perhaps that is the key point: we should never forget our own idiocy.</p>
<p>We should remember how absurd we are, because by doing so we might better be able to manage those moments in which we regress to the condition of children. We should try to laugh at our own
  idiocies – that might well diffuse those situations in which, like the couple at the station, we spoil things for ourselves and others and achieve nothing. We always secretly believe that we
  are the tragic hero of our own conflicts. But think of yourself as a jester instead. Then you might find that you achieve a better balance between what you want from another person and what you
  actually get from him or her.</p>
<p>Heading off Guilt</p>
<p>Those who are moved to write of their parents often express a deep sense of loss, of pain – of what Franz Kafka, in his unsent Letter to my Father
  (recently translated under the title Dearest Father), called being ‘inwardly wounded’. Kafka uses the phrase in the context of an account of a moment ‘from his earliest
  years’. He writes:</p>
<p>Thinking of yourself like this will probably help you reduce adversity in your life.</p>
<p>I was moaning continually in the night for water, certainly not because I was thirsty, but probably partly in order to irritate, partly for pleasure. After you had issued
      several threats, but to no avail, you took me out of bed and carried me onto the veranda and left me standing there alone for a while in my shirt in front of the closed door. I do not say that
      that was wrong; perhaps it was at that moment the only way to get some peace in the night. But I do mean by recalling this to describe your way of bringing me up and its effect on me.
      Afterwards, I was, indeed, at that time very obedient, but it left me inwardly wounded. Given my nature I could never reconcile the normality of my pointless crying for water with the
      extraordinary terribleness of being carried outside. Years later I still suffered from the tormenting idea that the huge man, my father, the highest authority, could, for almost any reason,
      come in the night and carry me from my bed onto the veranda – and that I was thus nothing to him. (Brief an den Vater: 10)</p>
<p>Kafka’s father, Hermann Kafka, was a physically massive man, and he had a dominating temperament to match. The highly sensitive boy was spiritually crushed by the
  bullying ways of his father – Kafka’s letter is a painful record of incidents of the kind quoted here. Yet what is so extraordinary is that Kafka is at pains to be just to his father
  – witness his almost exaggerated insistence that what his father did when the boy was crying in the night was perhaps not wrong. This is part of his general strategy in the letter – in
  his life – to come to terms with his father.</p>
<p>Kafka describes how he believes his father sees their relationship, and he lists the things he himself has done or failed to do, or aspects of his personality, that, he is sure, must have
  disappointed, frustrated or angered his father. He is sure that his father sees him as cold, distant and ungrateful. Moreover, he writes, his father thinks of this as Kafka’s fault – he
  is the guilty one. Kafka continues:</p>
<p>I am so convinced that this, your usual view of things, is correct that I also believe you to be wholly innocent as far as our estrangement is concerned. But I too am just
      as wholly innocent. If I could only get you to acknowledge that then – I shall not say a new life, since we are both too old for that – but a kind of peace would be possible; not an
      end to your reproaches but yet a softening of them. (Brief an den Vater: 6)</p>
<p>Later he adds: ‘I do not believe in the least that there was guilt on your part. Your effect on me was the effect that you inevitably had’ (Brief an den
  Vater: 8).</p>
<p>Above all, Kafka aims to absolve both himself and his father of guilt. And he wishes to do this by making his father see that what happened between them was inevitable given the nature –
  the differing nature – of their respective personalities.</p>
<p>Chemical Reactions</p>
<p>There is an idea implicit in the work of the Jewish-Italian writer Primo Levi which helps us see the issue more clearly, and understand why Kafka’s approach is so
  productive.</p>
<p>Levi was a chemist who was incarcerated in Auschwitz from February 1944 until January 1945. In many ways, he owed his survival to his having been a chemist. The most obvious way in which this
  was so was that he was put to work in the camp laboratory – the Nazis exploited his knowledge – and this meant that he had shelter from some of the harshest work and weather conditions.
  But the second, more subtle, benefit for him was perhaps just as important.</p>
<p>Because he was a chemist, Levi was used to experimenting with elements and compounds and observing how they react with each other. In one of those leaps of the imagination which is so obvious
  that it is missed by virtually everyone else, Levi applied this way of thinking to his fellow prisoners and thence to the camp as a whole. He saw it as a kind of massive experiment designed to test
  how different individuals would react when put in the particular conditions of the camp, recognizing that it can be extremely helpful to think of individual human beings as resembling chemical
  elements, with their own peculiar properties. Each reacts in a certain kind of way with other such elements, depending also on their respective properties.</p>
<p>So, just as, say, potassium reacts violently when exposed to air or to water, and therefore has to be stored under conditions which isolate it from such, we might think of human beings as
  inevitably reacting in specific ways, depending on their nature, when exposed to other individuals (or situations, for that matter).</p>
<p>When Kafka says of his father that his effect on him was the effect that he inevitably had, we might see him as expressing the same perspective on human beings as that offered by Levi –
  that is, that they are like chemical elements. Indeed, Kafka invites us into thinking in this way, since he sees both himself and his sisters in what we might call material or
  corporeal terms – as a mixture of matter or stuff derived from their father, Hermann Kafka, and mother, Julie Löwy. For example, he, Franz, is ‘a Löwy with a certain
  Kafka foundation’ whilst his sister Valli has ‘little Kafka material in her’. Hermann Kafka was a self-made businessman who had dragged himself out of a life of deprivation and
  poverty, someone who, as Hugo Bergmann, a friend of Kafka’s, said, ‘stood with both feet in his physical reality, in his business’. He was, as Kafka himself said, someone who
  valued ‘strength, health, appetite, a powerful voice, eloquence, self-confidence, superiority over the world, stamina, presence of mind, knowledge of human beings’ (Brief an den
  Vater: 7; 30; 71; 7). He was, in short, pretty much everything that Kafka was not, for Kafka himself was physically frail, emotionally and intellectually highly sensitive, cautious, timid,
  questioning and sceptical, and deeply unsure of himself. No wonder that two chemical elements of such differing natures would lead to an explosive reaction.</p>
<p>The immense value of looking at things this way is that it does much to cut the ground away from feelings of guilt. It makes no sense to blame a chemical for reacting as it does with another; it
  just does what it does. If we look at human beings in this way, we can also, perhaps, learn better to accept them for what they are, seeing the way they react as just a function of their individual
  nature. This is what Kafka is doing with his father. If it really was inevitable that he have a certain effect on his son, given their respective natures, it would make no sense blaming either of
  them for the situation, or for either of them to feel guilty.</p>
<p>Chemistry has some important things to teach us about interpersonal relations.</p>
<p>Of course, there are circumstances in which this model does not apply. It might be useless, for example, if we are thinking about the criminal justice system, where questions of guilt and
  responsibility have a much more impersonal aspect than they do in intimate family relationships. But, within the intimacy of the family, I think that this way of thinking can be very helpful. After
  all, individuals’ characters do seem largely fixed, and we have already discussed how the character a person has is largely a matter of chance – of what he or she is born with by way of
  natural talents, aptitudes and proclivities, as well as of the influence of external events. If, as Kafka did, one can look at those in the family by whom one feels let down – or from whom
  one would like so much more – as doing nothing more than acting from their nature, reacting to the world as their nature leads them to, then we might be able to feel less disappointed or want
  less from them, because we see them as simply being unable to give more. And that would be an improvement, perhaps a move towards more peaceful relations. Kafka sees the impossibility of changing
  his father, indeed the absurdity of trying to change him: he is what he is, and that is that. The best thing is simply to accept him as he is.</p>
<p>Of course, it is extremely difficult to accept others in this way. But it might help to reflect on how difficult it is to change oneself. Granted that it is hard to change oneself, the
  idea of changing another person becomes clear in all its absurdity. It is, of course, true that one can change oneself, at least in some ways and to some degree, but it is also true that this takes
  a lot of hard work and cannot be achieved instantaneously. Given that this is the case, you can see that it does not make much sense trying to change others. They may not even want to be changed!
  In such a case, what you need to do is to try to accept them as they are. As I say, this is very difficult to do, but it is something in your hands, whereas their changing is not, and so, to that
  extent, is a sensible thing to seek to do.</p>
<p>Getting Out of the Way</p>
<p>But, of course, Kafka also wanted his father to look at things as he did – to cease wanting him, Kafka, to change. And whether he was capable of that would be, from the
  present perspective, a matter of whether he happened to be the kind of chemical element that possessed the sort of flexibility required. He did not. What does one do in such a situation? One
  possibility is suggested by Dorothy Rowe in her book on depression, when she speaks about her sister. Rowe says that contact with her sister always sets her thinking about her childhood in such a
  way as to leave her feeling miserable because it brings back to her the fact that ‘every day is a struggle against the effects of a chronic illness which was a result of childhood
  neglect’ (Depression: the Way Out of Your Prison: 96). Hence, she tries to reduce the impact that her sister has on her by reducing contact with her. Rowe, borrowing a notion from
  Buddhist practice, sees this as a form of detachment, which she understands as a species of forgiveness – though different, of course, from the forgiveness so often (usually unrealistically)
  idealized as involving feelings of positive warmth for the person who has hurt us.</p>
<p>In my view, Rowe’s approach is deeply humane and honest. If it is impossible to avoid being hurt by someone, then the best thing is simply to reduce contact with that person. It seems so
  obvious, but it is hard, because families tend to be very demanding of one’s presence. There are all kinds of cultural, social and psychological pressures that demand of us that we get on
  well with our family – and the family itself can apply those pressures on us, just as we can apply them on ourselves. But if, as in the case Rowe discusses, there is someone in the family who
  keeps hurting us, and if we honestly think we can do nothing on either side to change that, then reducing or severing contact might well be the best option. No one could think it good; it is a
  matter of making the best of a bad job. But then, ‘the best of a bad job is all we ever make of it’, as Harcourt-Reilly, a character in one of T. S. Eliot’s plays, remarks
  (The Cocktail Party: 124).</p>
<p>Making Something of It</p>
<p>Kafka did not resolve his problems with his father. His letter was never sent, and we do not know what its impact on Hermann Kafka would have been anyway. Probably
  incomprehension. But what is clear is that Kafka felt that he had been damaged permanently by the way he had been brought up by his father. He tells us in his letter that he sought desperately to
  escape from his father’s influence but could not. For example, his several attempts to marry failed, and he felt that they did so because of his father: his father’s effect on him
  caused him to sabotage the engagements himself. To marry, he says, would have meant becoming equal to his father as head of his own household. But this parity would have meant that he, Kafka, would
  have become a ‘free, grateful, innocent, decent son’ and his father ‘an unvexed, nontyrannical, compassionate, satisfied father’. But, he says, for that to have happened
  ‘everything that had happened would have to be undone, i.e., we ourselves cancelled out’ (Brief an den Vater: 55). And that, of course, was impossible.</p>
<p>This sense of having been permanently damaged by one’s parents is very common. In his autobiographical novel Leavetaking, Peter Weiss tells us that in his family ‘[w]hen we
  spoke about life we had to be mournful and burdened. Life meant seriousness, effort, responsibility’ (Abschied von den Eltern: 57). He tells of the effect on him when, twice in his
  childhood, he met a friend of his parents, Fritz W, whose attitude to life was wholly different. In his presence Weiss felt liberated, relieved, light-hearted. The two meetings with Fritz W, he
  says,</p>
<p>the high points of my childhood, show me how differently my life, under other circumstances, could have developed, and they show me the treasure of unused joy which was in
      me, and still is within me, under the layers of sores. (Abschied von den Eltern: 50)</p>
<p>Or, in Italo Svevo’s blackly humorous novel Zeno’s Conscience, at the end of the chapter on his father’s death, Zeno tells how his father stood up
  from his death bed and struck him on the cheek before dropping dead to the floor. The meaning of this gesture haunts Zeno for the rest of his life: was it merely a rebuke to him because he had
  tried to keep his father in bed as the doctor ordered? More likely it is a rebuke because ‘[w]e had so little in common that he confessed to me that, of all the people who disturbed him the
  most in this world, I was at the top of the list’. And: ‘Many times, when I think about it, I am amazed by the strangeness of the fact that this desperation concerning myself and my
  future made its first appearance on the death of my father and not before’ (La coscienza di Zeno: 28; 27). Like Kafka, like Weiss, he was wounded for life.</p>
<p>But there is something that Kafka, Weiss and Zeno can teach us, for they channelled their pain into something creative and thus made it more bearable than it otherwise might have been. All well
  and good, you might think, but not all of us can turn our pain into something creative. In one sense that is true: we cannot all be a great writer like Kafka, and that is just the way it is.
  Nonetheless, if you feel hurt in the way Kafka did, then you can write: you can write down your thoughts, your feelings, in the form of a diary, or as a letter – it need never be sent; that
  is not the point – to the person who has hurt you. It is extraordinary how helpful this is. It is not a matter of publishing anything, or even sharing the content with anyone. It is a matter
  of externalizing your thoughts and feelings, of externalizing yourself, a process which allows you to gain some distance on yourself and your life. There is something about
  putting your experiences into the form, the pattern, of writing that structures things and makes them better or more bearable. You might also write the response to your letter, on the part
  of the person who has hurt you, imagining how he or she might reply. Kafka sought hard to see how things might look from the perspective of his father, because this, too, helped to place and
  structure his own experience in a just perspective. You can do what Kafka did.</p>
<p>Communication Problems</p>
<p>Whatever else we say about Kafka’s relationship with his father, however, it is clear that Hermann Kafka never made any serious effort to communicate with him. But what
  can be so painful in the family is that often the will to communicate and open up to another family member is deep and real, and yet somehow is thwarted. This was the situation in the case of
  Weiss, who speaks of his father’s attitude to his children, whom</p>
<p>he always avoided, and with whom he could never speak, but when he was away from home he could perhaps feel tenderness for his children, and longing for them, and he always
      carried pictures of them with him, and he certainly looked at these worn, crumpled pictures in the evening in the hotel room when he was travelling, and he certainly believed that when he
      returned there would be trust, but when he came back there was always only disappointment and mutual understanding was impossible. (Abschied von den Eltern: 9)</p>
<p>Weiss articulates one of the ways in which human beings can find themselves awkward, inhibited and constrained with each other, even though there is no obvious reason why this
  should be so. This fact about our condition reminds us how little we understand ourselves. It is no surprise that greed, envy, anger and fear lead to the collapse of relationships; it is much more
  of a surprise that such collapse can be attendant on relationships where there is good will on both sides. This often happens in families, as Weiss reminds us, because we do usually want family
  relationships to work. The blood tie counts for a great deal. It is hard for many people to shake off the idea that they ought to be able to get on well with their family because they are bound to
  them by blood, something that is, in this context, deeply mysterious, physical and yet spiritual.</p>
<p>This sense of mystery is well brought out by Gabriel Josipovici in his novel Contre-Jour, an imaginary reconstruction of the relationship between the artist Pierre Bonnard and his wife,
  Marthe, through the eyes of the daughter they never had. The first part of the novel is a long monologue by the daughter, now an adult and living on her own, addressed to the mother. Speaking of a
  visit she paid to her parents, she says that she always had a sense that she had no place in the family, was hardly even noticed by her mother and father, who were closed in on themselves, and
  simply did not know what they could do with her. And because she felt so excluded, she clung on even more tightly. However,</p>
<p>[p]erhaps it wasn’t really like that . . . Perhaps it was always only my fault. Perhaps I merely overreacted to a common complaint, to . . . a fact of life . . . I
      don’t know. We act and then we try to interpret those acts, but the interpretations are only further acts, which themselves call out for later interpretation. (Contre-Jour:
      42–3)</p>
<p>What Josipovici captures so well is the sense that we often do not know what we are doing, that our thoughts and emotions seem so deeply elusive when we reflect on them, even
  if, at the time we act on them, they seem so clear to us. It is as if we lived in two worlds, one on the surface, where we can explain what we are doing – visiting parents, seeking to
  establish a harmonious relationship, or whatever – and another, deeper world, where we do not really know what we are doing or why we are doing it, because we do not understand the
  deeper springs of thought and action which motivate us to do what we are doing. The meaning of it all escapes us – which can make only all the deeper the need we might have for connection
  with, for example, our parents.</p>
<p>Holding Onto That Which is Difficult</p>
<p>We can turn this mystery to our advantage. In his Letters to a Young Poet, R. M. Rilke says that ‘things are not all so comprehensible and expressible as people
  usually want us to believe; most happenings are inexpressible, take place in a region where no word has ever ventured’ (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 13). He uses this as his
  leading thought in responding to the questions and worries of his young correspondent, Franz Kappus.</p>
<p>Kappus wanted advice about some of his poems that he had sent to Rilke, but it turns out that he was also, and perhaps primarily, seeking advice about his life and, in particular, about his deep
  feeling of loneliness. What Rilke encourages him to do is not to fight his feelings of dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>I would like to ask you, . . . to the extent that I can, to try to have patience with all the unresolved things in your heart, to love the questions themselves as
      if they were locked rooms and books written in a very strange language. Do not strive for answers which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them. And it really is a
      matter of living everything. Live your questions now. (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 30–1)</p>
<p>Rilke sees Kappus’s loneliness as being immensely fruitful, because it gives him an opportunity to find himself.</p>
<p>People have (with the help of conventions) made everything easy for themselves, have found the easiest side of that which is easy. But it is clear that we must hold onto
      that which is difficult. All that lives holds onto that, everything in nature grows and defends itself in its own way and is its own for itself, seeks to be itself at all cost and against all
      resistance. We know little, but that we must hold onto that which is difficult is a certainty that will not leave us. It is good to be lonely, for loneliness is difficult. (Briefe an einen
      jungen Dichter: 49)</p>
<p>Crucially, he recommends that Kappus look at things as a child does:</p>
<p>To go into yourself and for hours meet no one – that is what one must be able to achieve. To be lonely as one was as a child when the adults went around involved with
      things that seemed great and important because the grown-ups seemed so occupied and because one understood nothing of what they were doing. (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 42)</p>
<p>Rilke sees such a state, in which the activities of people seem odd or strange, as they do to his imagined child, as profoundly positive. For it allows a kind of
  detachment.</p>
<p>Love and the Spectacle of the World</p>
<p>We can apply this to family relationships. If we are frustrated or angry with those in our family who do not give us what we want and need, we are likely to feel lonely. We
  naturally seek to rid ourselves of these negative feelings by trying to get what we want. But if we allow the loneliness in question to live in us, Rilke suggests, instead of fighting to disburden
  ourselves of it, we realize that we are closer to finding some peace of soul. This is because the frustration and anger attach us all the more to the condition from which we are seeking
  release. In other words, accepting the loneliness that is the other side of the frustration and anger in question can lead to the dissipation of these negative emotions. What we must do, Rilke
  suggests, is cultivate the loneliness of the child, in which one does not understand. That is, we must accept the mystery of our inability to get from others what we would like; we must
  make the mystery of family relations something we live, as Rilke puts it, not something that we seek to be rid of. Hence he writes to Kappus:</p>
<p>Avoid adding to the drama that is always stretched out between parents and children; it uses up too much energy and wastes the love of elders, which has an effect, and is
      warming, even when it does not understand. Do not ask for advice from them and assume that you will not be understood. But believe in a love that is kept for you like an inheritance and trust
      that in this love there is an energy and a blessing from which you do not have to escape in order to go very far! (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 35–6)</p>
<p>You might think that what Rilke is advising, however difficult, at least makes sense if love is there. But what if it is not? I think that, though this question is
  understandable, it misses the point Rilke wants to make. The love in question may not be a love that parents have for their children. When Rilke asks us to believe in a love that is like an
  inheritance I think he is asking us to believe in a love that we can cultivate by accepting loneliness and the mystery of family relations, and living our questions. This is why
  he counsels Kappus again and again to pay attention to the things of this world – the night sky, the wind, the trees, the animals. Here, he says, is a source of closeness to things,
  of love of the things of this world.</p>
<p>His point is that if the world offers these things to us and is worth loving, then it is our parents who gave us the possibility of responding to the world in this way in the first place. That
  is their inheritance of love to us. We may never have the relationship we want with them. We may even, as Dorothy Rowe suggested, have to reduce contact with them or break it off altogether. But
  Rilke would say that this is a way of living our questions; he would remind us that we have inherited life itself, which is an inheritance of love. And, of course, to love in that way can
  itself lead us away from frustration and anger.</p>
<p>No one can say for another whether he or she might be able to find things good in the way Rilke suggests is possible. What we make of his thoughts lies in our hands, and with the expanses and
  limitations of our own character. But I would say: you should try to do what Rilke suggests. Try to open your eyes to the endless extraordinary sights of the natural world; we go round most of the
  time in a kind of routine, dazed as to what is there. But the plants, trees, animals, sky, sea, and so on are there to be seen, marvellous in their utter gratuity. If we open our eyes, we might be
  able to be consoled for the pain we carry within us. And if we are consoled in this way, we may be reconciled to the sense of disappointment or loss or hurt we might have concerning our parents.
  They, after all, gave us this life. It is thanks to them that we can marvel at the world at all.</p>
