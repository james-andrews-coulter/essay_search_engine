            <h3>¶ Sexual Liberation</h3>
<p>We tend to believe that we live in an era of sexual liberation. We tell ourselves a story of progress, from the repression of the Victorians and the religious fanatics to the openness of modernity. There are indeed some signs of genuine change. Stand-up comics can make jokes about masturbation, women’s sexual appetites have been recognised, bathrooms are designed to feel airy and open. Yet the notion that we are liberated causes us problems all of its own, because it brings with it the assumption that hang-ups and awkwardness can no longer legitimately exist.</p>
<p>In truth, of course, true liberation remains a radically unfinished project; ‘unfinished’ because we continue to struggle to admit key things about who we are from a sexual perspective. This becomes especially painful around relationships, given that, for many of us, the dream of love is that we will at last be able to admit to who we are sexually without embarrassment. Yet the reality is more awkward. We frequently find ourselves facing an apparent choice between being honest and being liked.</p>
<p>The choice is not good for us. The sense that we need to hide, deny and bury away key elements of who we are is not, overall, very good for us. When we repress things that are important, they make themselves heard in other ways. As psychoanalysis has revealed, the ‘dirty’ parts of ourselves can show up disguised as greed, harsh opinions, bad temper, alcoholism or other forms of risky, damaging behaviour. There is a high price to disavowing powerful parts of ourselves: our sexuality can become split from our more enduring relationships. We may lose potency and desire with those we love, so unacceptable does our sexuality appear to be to us, so at odds with our higher feelings. Freud first noted this pattern in early 20th-century Vienna: ‘Where they love, they cannot desire. Where they desire, they cannot love.’</p>
<p>True sexual liberation or self-acceptance doesn’t have to mean abandoning all control or deliberately flaunting our less elevated needs at every turn. We don’t have to fully embrace every impulse: we still need privacy and bathroom doors; we just need to be able to admit in an unfrightened way to ourselves and at points to our partners who we really are.</p>
<p>The core point of true liberation is to reduce the unfair and debilitating burden of shame with which we continue to wrestle only too often. Our goal should be to adopt a mature perspective on our own sexuality and to increase opportunities for moments of courageous and relationship-enhancing honesty.</p>
