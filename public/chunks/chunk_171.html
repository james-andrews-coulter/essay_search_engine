            <h3>¶ Weakness of Strength</h3>
<p>The failings of friends, colleagues and partners can be deeply galling. We look upon their faults and wonder why they are the way they are.</p>
<p>At moments of particularly acute agitation, we need to rehearse the Weakness of Strength Theory. This dictates that we should strive to see people’s weaknesses as the inevitable downside of certain merits that drew us to them, and from which we will benefit at other points – even if none of these benefits are apparent at present. What we’re seeing are not their faults, pure and simple, but rather the shadow side of things that are genuinely good about them. We’re picking up on weaknesses that derive from strengths.</p>
<p>In the 1870s, when he was living in Paris, the American novelist Henry James became a good friend of the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who was also living in the city at that time. Henry James was particularly taken by the unhurried, tranquil style of the Russian writer’s storytelling. He obviously took a long time over every sentence, weighing different options, changing and polishing until everything was perfect. It was an ambitious, inspiring approach to writing.</p>
<p>However, in personal and social life, these same virtues could make Turgenev a maddening companion. He would accept an invitation to lunch, then, the day before, send a note explaining that he would not be able to attend, then another saying how much he looked forward to the occasion. Then he would turn up – two hours late. Arranging anything with him was a nightmare. Yet his social waywardness was really just the same thing that made him so attractive as a writer. It was the same unwillingness to hurry; the same desire to keep the options open until the last moment. This produced marvellous books, but dinner party chaos. In reflecting on Turgenev’s character, Henry James reflected that his Russian friend was exhibiting the ‘weakness of his strength’.</p>
<p>The theory goes like this: every strength that an individual has necessarily brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Every virtue has an associated weakness. Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person.</p>
<p>This is a theory that can help calm us down at moments of particular crisis, because it changes the way we see the defects, failings and weakness of others. Our minds tend to hive off the strengths and see these as essential, while deeming the weaknesses as a freakish add-on; in truth, the weaknesses are part and parcel of the strengths.</p>
<p>The theory usefully undermines the unhelpful idea that – if only we looked a bit harder – we would find someone who was always perfect to be around. If strengths are invariably connected to failings, there won’t be anyone who is remotely flawless. We may well find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses.</p>
