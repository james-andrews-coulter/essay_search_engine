        <h2>The Gap Cliff</h2>
<p>There were until very recently no barriers. The 30-metre drop onto rocks makes death a certainty. The cliff is a twenty-minute drive from the centre of Sydney. It’s extremely beautiful, too, formed about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic era when a large chunk of sandstone cracked and started to be eroded. Silver gulls wheel languidly around the base and a variety of eucalypts decorate the upper ridge. Around a hundred people jump off the top every year; many more come by and think very seriously about it.
Our societies are especially sensitive on the topic of suicide. For the ancient Romans, a prerequisite of a good life was the knowledge that it could be ended at any time, were it to grow unbearable. If mortal illness threatened, or if a person had been gravely disgraced or was being persecuted by enemies, then Rome’s Stoic philosophers did not insist on the necessity to keep going. Unlike later Christian thinkers, they posited no responsibility to a god or to the state. Everyone’s life was in the end their own, to do with as they wished.
Few Roman thinkers did, in fact, commit suicide, but what mattered for them was not so much the actual event as its possibility. It was the thought of death that was being intelligently and judiciously invited to lend relief for the troubles of life. ‘The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can,’ wrote Seneca. ‘He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are numerous events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he can set himself free.’ Seneca was not advocating random or thoughtless exits; he was attempting to give us more courage in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always within our remit, if we have genuinely tried everything and the pain is beyond our capacities, to choose a noble path out of our troubles. He was seeking to strip willed death of its associations with pathology and to render it instead an option that the wise would always know was there as a backstop. It wouldn’t even need to be a grim spectre; the Stoics emphasised that death could be a moment to celebrate what had gone well in a life, to thank friends and to appreciate the beautiful sides of the world. The idea was to see death as a door through which we knew we had the right and the power to walk if it felt necessary.
The Gap is not a cliff to die from; it’s a place to focus on why life matters. It’s a sublime location in which to accept that life should be a willed act, not a duty. It’s a place to ask ourselves, with every possibility of an end before us, why we might, after all, keep going. It may take a serious confrontation with the idea of death for us to finally ascertain what might make life properly worthwhile for us.
As importantly, the Gap has become a place of friendship. Before his death in 2012, a local resident called Don Ritchie, a retired World War Il veteran, went out daily onto the cliff to engage with people who might have been tempted to jump. The ‘Angel of the Gap’, as he became known, would start by asking: “Can I help you in some way?’ and then would gradually build up to a connection and a friendship. His view was that almost everyone who thinks of killing themselves is essentially short of a friend. We die from isolation, not of our troubles. Since Ritchie’s passing, his work has been carried out by a new generation of volunteers.
The Gap isn’t a place for suicide, it’s a place to work out a better way to live.## Chobe National Park</p>
<p>The best time and place to come and see them in their thousands is during the rainy season, as they travel between the Chobe River floodplains in Namibia and the grasslands of Botswana’s Makgadikgadi region 500 kilometres away. Their stripes are every bit as astonishing as they seemed when we were children, defying us to believe that they have not been patiently painted on by a skilled artist. Each example has a thick dorsal line running from the forehead to the tail, and branching stripes running downwards along the body, except for where they arch and split over the front and rear legs. Every backside has its unique pattern, allowing their young to find their mother in the herd, while the collective shimmering of the lines confuses their most feared predators, the colour-blind lion and hyena, as well as providing protection from horseflies, which appear averse to landing on such complicated decoration. Zebras may share a common ancestry and profile with horses, but they have none of the horse’s docility or desire to help us out, a factor which has changed history. It isn’t as if we haven’t tried to get them to pull our ploughs or carry our luggage. Every effort, however, has been comedically unsuccessful. In 1261, Sultan Baibars of Egypt sent a zebra to Alfonso X of Castile, which promptly threw the king off its back. In 1471, a zebra gifted by a Somalian king to the emperor of China grew so unruly it had to be put down. The Germans tried to create a mounted zebra division in Namibia and lost ten men in the process. And in the late 19th century, the eccentric zoologist Walter Rothschild tied six of them to a carriage and attempted to drive to Buckingham Palace, but they broke free and escaped across the Hampshire countryside.
Of all the 148 larger terrestrial herbivores, humans have only ever managed to domesticate five kinds: sheep, goats, cows [including oxen), pigs and horses. And we’ve had moderate local success with ten others: Arabian one-humped camels, Bactrian two-humped camels, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, Bali cattle, mithans and yaks. Crucially, not a single one of these fifteen was native to North America, Australia or sub-Saharan Africa, while South America had to make do with llamas and alpacas, which are not much good with ploughs and collapse quite easily when anyone tries to ride them. So the big, useful animals existed overwhelmingly only in Eurasia, and this is the single greatest reason why Eurasian societies were able to develop a great deal faster than others, and hence why some ended up colonised and others colonists. Without an animal to pull a plough and carry heavy things, there was until the invention of steam power a strict limit to possible development.
It turns out, therefore, that the zebra’s refusal to help out humans was more or less directly responsible for the relative economic impoverishment of the regions in which it dwelt. We can, from a certain perspective, almost admire the zebra for its steadfastness; whatever the inducements, it was not going to make friends with us or tie its fate to our whims. Each one of us submits to so much, and often for no good reason, that we might take inspiration from this animal’s stubborn independence of mind. Zebras injure more zookeepers per year than tigers. They are impossible to lasso with a rope and have still never been successfully ridden any distance. There is a zebra inside each of us that might sometimes learn to resist sugar cubes and do more of its own thing.</p>
