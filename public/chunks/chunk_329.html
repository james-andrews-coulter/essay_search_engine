        <h3>1 The War on ‘Beauty’</h3>
<p>Since the dawn of construction, it was understood that the task of an architect was not only to make a building serviceable, but also to render it beautiful. That would involve a host of manoeuvres above and beyond pure material necessity. In the name of beauty, an architect might add a band of coloured tiles above the windows or a line of sculpted flowers over the door; they might try to create symmetry in the front façade, or carefully ensure that the windows got proportionally smaller on every storey.</p>
<p>Even if the construction were a practical one, such as an aqueduct or a factory, architects would strive to give it a pleasing appearance. The Romans understood that a water-pumping system might be as beautiful as a temple; the early Victorians felt that even a factory could have some of the aesthetic properties of an elegant country house; and the Milanese knew that a shopping arcade could carry some of the ambitions of a cathedral.</p>

<p>But when architecture reached modern times, beauty became taboo. The architects of the modern movement waged a war on what they now described as the effeminacy, wastefulness and pretention of all previous ‘beautifying’ moves. In an essay called ‘Ornament and Crime’ (1910), the Austrian modernist Adolf Loos argued that to decorate a building with anything ‘pretty’ was a sin against the true profession of the architect, which he now redefined in purely functional terms. Loos’ modernist colleague Le Corbusier proposed that only undecorated buildings were ‘honest’, and that all thoughts of beauty were a betrayal of the true mission of architecture, which was only to create watertight functional structures. As modernism declared: ‘Form must follow function’ — in other words, the appearance of a building should never be shaped by a consideration for beauty; all that should matter is the basic material purpose.</p>
<p>At the outset, this seemed liberating. The nineteenth century had produced some very over-decorated buildings, in which the beautifying impulse had reached a decadent stage.</p>
<p>At the same time, many early modernist buildings — especially those for wealthy clients — were elegant in a way that felt novel and cleansing, like eating a kiwi fruit after too much chocolate cake. It seemed that the dictum that form should follow function was about to release a highly attractive new kind of architecture on the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dream quickly turned sour. When property developers heard that the artistic avant-garde was now promoting a concept of functionalism, they rejoiced. From the most high-brow quarters, the most ungenerous motives had been given a seal of approval. No longer would these developers have to spend money on anything to do with beauty. Out could go the symmetry, the flowers, the nice but slightly more expensive materials. It could all be as quick, ugly and cheap as possible; after all, isn’t that what the great minds of architecture had advised? In no time, what had started as an interesting niche idea had become justification for vast suburbs and commercial districts completely devoid of charm. Sheds and brutal boxes abounded.</p>
<p>In any case, the modernists hadn’t even been honest about what they were doing. They might have proposed that all they were interested in was ‘function’, but in reality, the great ones, like Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe, agonised over each element of their building. They were — in secret — as interested in visual charm as their predecessors. They had merely wanted to create a stir by presenting themselves as clean-cut, rigorous, engineer types, but they had remained artists.</p>
<p>This nuance was lost on the property developers who came after them. Their constructions were not elegantly pared down with grace; they were sloppy, mean-minded and ugly. Except that now, because of the words of the modernist masters, there was apparently nothing one could do to charge them with a dereliction of duty. The concept of beauty had been rendered old-fashioned; it seemed elitist and woolly. No one could complain that beauty was missing from the world without sounding soft-headed. Modernity became ugly because we forgot how to articulate that beauty is, in the end, as much of a necessity for a building as a functioning roof. We lost the vocabulary to describe our pain.</p>
