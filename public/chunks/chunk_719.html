            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>HOW COULD WE BE ANYTHING BUT…?</p>
<p>It is, in a sense, astonishing that we ever manage to be anything but very concerned.</p>
<p>There is so much to which we are exposed, so many serious and unpredictable risks permanently waiting to threaten our peace of mind.</p>
<p>•      We live on a crowded planet, bathed in an atmosphere of dread, frenzy and ambition, and are forced to navigate around our vast technology-filled cities with a biological makeup better suited to a simpler, quieter, less excitable life in the savannah.</p>
<p>•      We dwell within painfully fragile physical envelopes, where something could give way at any time, a blood clot smaller than a full stop having the power to destroy us in an instant.</p>
<p>•      We are repeatedly compelled to make enormous life choices without the necessary facts and can have little clue what really awaits us around the corner.</p>
<p>•      Our long childhoods leave us open to every kind of turmoil and dislocation, our beautifully complicated minds being at risk of permanent trauma due to scars that we might have acquired before we could walk.</p>
<p>•      There is seldom sufficient time to connect with the quieter parts of ourselves or to grasp our uplifting unimportance in the grander scheme. We barely notice ourselves living. Our mass media continuously inflames our passions and fears while blinding us to the quiet, steady, undramatic kindness and hope all around us.</p>
<p>•      In relationships, we long to let down our guard but, at the same time, fear – not unreasonably – the grave hurt that may ensue whenever we surrender our emotions to another person.</p>
<p>•      We put children on the earth and cannot be happy unless they thrive – and yet have no ability to protect them from fate.</p>
<p>•      At work, our reputations could be destroyed in a moment by malice or error. We want desperately to win and yet are continually haunted by the spectre of defeat. We are never as young, beautiful or intelligent as we need to be.</p>
<p>•      Our imaginations permanently remind us of everything that is missing, everything that might go wrong and everything that we might already have messed up.</p>
<p>From a clear-eyed perspective, the risks and troubles that face us are truly multitudinous and petrifying. Yet still people will sometimes casually tell us to ‘relax’ – as though such an injunction might be the work of a moment rather than the achievement of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for all this, we should strive with deep seriousness to let go of one or two of our anxieties – by understanding them a little better, forming good habits to appease them and sharing them with a few kindly others – and thereby grow to enjoy the odd less worried day, when we can look up for a moment from our fretful thoughts and appreciate the wonder and blessing of being alive.</p>
<p>This is a book about anxiety and how to overcome it.</p>
