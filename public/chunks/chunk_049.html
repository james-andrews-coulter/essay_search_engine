        <h2>Post-Coitus &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>If sex were as easy as our society sometimes suggests, we’d expect not to feel appreciably any different after, as opposed to before, the act. As it is, for many of us, what we go through immediately following orgasm isn’t so much closeness or joy as a very particular kind of sadness, one all the more lonely and peculiar because it seems so hard to talk about without sounding ungrateful or mean. We may – in the aftermath of one of life’s most pleasurable sensations – be thrown into intense post-coital melancholy.</p>
<p>As we lie in the semi-darkness, with our partner breathing gently beside us, sleep may elude us. Our minds may scour the inner landscape, refusing to let consciousness go. We may be alert and at the same time panicky, heavy and sad. How could something so joyful have precipitated such sorrow?</p>
<p>At the root of much post-coital melancholy is a shame as to how we have ended up in bed like this. Sex can stir up passions which are deeply at odds with our daily conduct and beliefs. In the name of sex, an otherwise sober and gentle person will beg to be tied up and flogged; a generally exceptionally loyal and careful person will violate every marital vow; in a noisy nightclub, an intelligent and thoughtful soul will spend hours chatting with a companion with whom they have no deeper connection.</p>
<p>The instant orgasm has occurred, the bad faith one has been involved in comes to light. In past ages, this would have been the moment to head to the church or temple. One would plunge oneself into holy water or say some ritual words of atonement to a grave-faced priest. We may scoff at such superstition, but these divine rituals existed for a reason: in their way, they recognised both the deep pull of the erotic and the contradictory claims of our higher minds. They were sympathetic to how strongly good people may long for dignity, fidelity and wisdom and yet simultaneously be drawn towards degeneracy and vice.</p>
<p>Our first experience of melancholic sexual guilt probably came in adolescence. As children, we might have been uncomplicatedly sweet; we could have told our mother everything; our favourite activity might have been horse-riding or playing with our trains. Then suddenly, we needed constantly to lock ourselves in the bathroom and think obsessively of certain scenarios. No sooner were we done than a darkness settled in on us which has – in many ways – never left us.</p>
<p>The melancholy and shame come especially to the fore after being with someone we don’t particularly love, yet who might love us a lot. How could we, for the sake of a few moments of pleasure, act in such an amoral way? We might hope that we could turn to the kindly partner whose body we have lusted after and confess our inconsistency and lies and ask that they might absolve us of our transgression: how much we might feel for them if only they could understand that we didn’t, despite what just happened, have any of the right feelings for them …</p>
<p>In post-coital exhaustion, we become aware of how much time we have squandered on sexual adventure. In the hours we have wasted scheming and plotting, we might have finished a script, written a business plan or sent in a university paper. We might have been looking after some small children who begged us to be back by bath time.</p>
<p>What we wish for more than anything is reassurance that we remain, despite everything, a sweet enough human being – just one with a complicated set of imperatives to juggle. We are melancholic after a certain kind of sex because we wish our lives could be simpler; we wish that sex didn’t pull us in contrary directions; we wish that we could only ever love and desire the same person.</p>
