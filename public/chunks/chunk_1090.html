        <h2>Places of Pilgrimage</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, across Europe, there was really only one reason to go travelling: in order to visit a shrine to a long-dead saint who might, if we prayed deeply enough and had the right sum of money, help us to get over a range of ailments of mind or body. Europe was covered with sites rendered sacred and therapeutic through association with a saint, whose bodily remains — normally entombed or framed within a costly display case — formed the centrepiece of a pilgrimage. The Catholic Church had a catalogue of shrines available, depending on the nature of the affliction. Women having trouble breastfeeding would be advised to travel to Saint-Sauveur Basilica in Rocamadour in southwestern France (you could buy supplies of the Virgin Mary’s breast milk). Sufferers from headaches were directed to St Agathius’ bones in the Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen in Bad Staffelstein in Bavaria. And those who had sexual problems were commonly told to seek assistance from the remains of St Catherine of Siena, which were widely spread around Italy: one of her ribs being found in Florence, three fingers and a foot in Venice, a shoulder blade in Rome and — most spectacularly — her whole, unusually well-preserved head in an ornate reliquary at the back of the Basilica San Domenico in Siena.</p>
<p>Today we seldom believe in the power of saintly places to cure us, but we continue to trust, in a vague but plausible way, that there might be places that could work a curative effect on our troubles. We don’t want to travel only in order to get away; we want to return as different people. We might, in an entirely secular spirit, think of updating (even if only for ourselves) the Catholic Church’s catalogue of therapeutic destinations. There might be a small village at the foot of a glacier that could help us to rediscover perspective; there are cities that can revive specific ambitions; there could be a lemon grove that would silence the negative inner voices.</p>
<p>The ideal travel agent of the future wouldn’t simply offer bargains or convenient itineraries. They would take the full measure of the sicknesses of our psyches and attempt to match these to a landscape with a power to loosen our hold on despair or sadness. There could be secular equivalents to the abbey church in Conques in southern France — recommended to soldiers lacking courage — or the Jesuit church in Antwerp containing the remains of St Apollonia, the patron saint of teeth. The pilgrims of old may have been eccentric in the details of their hopes, but they were astute enough in sensing that there could be locations that might redeem and assist them. We should take care to wander the earth with an atlas of therapeutic places to guide us.</p>
