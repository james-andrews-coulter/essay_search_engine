        <h3>3Improving the instinct for familiarity</h3>
<p>a) The Repetition Dynamic</p>
<p>The instinct for Familiarity leads us to two kinds of difficult types: people who have the same bad qualities as parental figures; and people who have none of the bad qualities as parental figures, but none of their good qualities either.</p>
<p>Two responses to these problems are often suggested by outsiders: that we should leave a troubling person, or that we should change our types. Both of these are very hard. At the School of Life, we are pessimistic about whether human beings can ever completely change the types of people they are attracted to.</p>
<p>Therefore, we offer a different solution: we believe that we should direct our efforts to changing the way we characteristically deal with the difficulties we are attracted to. At present, the way we tend to deal with the difficulties we are attracted to is in the manner of the children we once were. Our pattern of response is riddled with some of the problems that a young person might make. For example: we over-personalise issues that we are not principally responsible for; we don’t explain our distress; we panic; we retreat into silence; we sulk.</p>
<p>In other words, there is an enormous opportunity to move from a child to an adult pattern of response in relation to the difficulties we are attracted to. What may be making our relationships awful is not simply that (for instance) we’re attracted to someone who is a bit fiery, distant or manically busy, but that we continue to react to these issues as we did when, long ago in childhood, we first met with them. There is a properly grown-up – less agitated, less fragile – response that in principle we could have and that would make almost all the difference.</p>
<p>For most tricky characteristics to which we might instinctively be drawn, we can distinguish a child’s reaction and an ideal adult response.</p>
<p>Our past may have assigned us an instinctive draw towards tricky people. But how we deal with them, once we’re together, is open to revision. It makes all the difference whether we can move from column B to column C.</p>
<p>A:Tricky behaviour</p>
<p>B:Child reaction</p>
<p>C:Ideal adult reaction</p>
<p>Shouting</p>
<p>‘It’s all my fault…’</p>
<p>‘It’s something in them.’</p>
<p>Crushing intelligence</p>
<p>‘I’m stupid.’</p>
<p>‘That’s interesting…’</p>
<p>Depressed</p>
<p>‘I have to fix you.’</p>
<p>‘I’ll do my best, but I’m not ultimately responsible for your mindset…’</p>
<p>Frightening</p>
<p>‘I deserve this.’</p>
<p>‘I’m not intimidated by you.’</p>
<p>Distracted, preoccupied</p>
<p>Attention-seeking: ‘Notice me’.</p>
<p>‘You’re busy; I’m busy, that’s OK…’</p>
<p>b) The Recoil Dynamic</p>
<p>In the Recoil Dynamic, a pattern of behaviour has been experienced as so dangerous that one seeks its opposite as the natural escape. They were horrible and also scholarly, well organised, polite, creative or rich, so the latter attributes become toxic. We feel that everyone who doesn’t have those attributes will be nice: we look for recoil qualities that are directly the opposite of the toxic qualities.</p>
<p>The trouble is that, with time, the recoil qualities tend to annoy us too. At first, it’s a relief to be with someone who doesn’t have the characteristics we’ve grown allergic to. Then we start to criticise our partners for the very qualities our instincts sought them out for. It’s not surprising we do this, because we’ve been taught by experts (in childhood) how to put down these kinds of people.</p>
<p>Our difficult parent not only made their own merits toxic, they simultaneously taught us how to criticise those who lacked those merits. Our memories retain a clear education in how to attack the very thing we’re drawn to in recoil. We are highly skilled at being crushing: we were taught by world experts from the earliest age!</p>
<p>A:Types we’re drawn to</p>
<p>B:What we know well how to say</p>
<p>Non-intellectual</p>
<p>‘You’re a fucking idiot.’</p>
<p>Relaxed, disorganised</p>
<p>‘Get your shit together.’</p>
<p>Socially modest</p>
<p>‘You’re vulgar.’</p>
<p>Shy</p>
<p>‘You’re so boring.’</p>
<p>Economically unimpressive</p>
<p>‘You’re so poor.’</p>
<p>Uncomplaining, unassertive</p>
<p>‘You’re a wimp.’</p>
<p>One suggestion is just to stop dating Recoil people. The advice is to transform our instincts (or dramatically override them) and learn to be attracted to people who have the good qualities of parental figures, but – by good fortune – not their problematic sides. But this is hard. A more realistic goal is to accept that we’re probably always going to be drawn to Recoil qualities, but we can learn to manage them less aggressively and with a greater degree of forgiveness.</p>
<p>We could learn to feel rather differently about people who possess Recoil qualities, because the rebound qualities aren’t bad in themselves.</p>
<p>Qualities of a difficult parent that became toxic</p>
<p>Recoil qualities we like</p>
<p>Critical things we say</p>
<p>Nicer things we could say</p>
<p>Highly intelligent</p>
<p>Non-intellectual</p>
<p>‘You’re a fucking idiot.’</p>
<p>‘Many important things aren’t complicated.’</p>
<p>Driven, very organised</p>
<p>Relaxed, a bit disorganised</p>
<p>‘Get your shit together.’</p>
<p>‘So what? You can be you.’</p>
<p>Socially modest, shy</p>
<p>Gregarious, socially ambitious</p>
<p>‘You’re a snob; you’re pretentious.’</p>
<p>‘You’re confident and friendly and we don’t have to do everything together.’</p>
<p>Powerful personality</p>
<p>Slightly shy</p>
<p>‘You’re so boring.’</p>
<p>‘You are a calming presence in my life.’</p>
<p>Rich</p>
<p>Economically unimpressive</p>
<p>‘You’re so poor.’</p>
<p>‘Money isn’t everything.’</p>
<p>Strong-willed</p>
<p>Compliant</p>
<p>‘You’re a wimp.’</p>
<p>‘You’re sweet.’</p>
<p>We have trouble with our partners not because they are so awful, but because we’ve learned to respond to their Recoil qualities in a punitive manner. There is another way of handling them. The first thing is to keep clearly in mind that our partner is doing us a favour: for example, the unintellectual person is sparing us the traumatic humiliation we would have around a scholarly type. The rather disorganised person is protecting us from the distress we would feel if we were with someone highly methodical and organised. We should keep reminding ourselves of the awkward truth that certain qualities are difficult for us. It’s not a mistake that we’ve been drawn to this person. We should remind ourselves that our room for manoeuvre is limited. The task is not to hate a partner for their deficiencies; it is to get interested, in a kindly way, in their development.</p>
