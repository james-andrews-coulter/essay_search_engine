        <h3>Humility</h3>
<p>One thing that failure strips us of is a feeling that we might be ‘good’ people. This might indicate that we must therefore be ‘bad’, but the reality is more complicated. Ironically, people who are genuinely good – people who know about kindness, patience, forgiveness, compromise, apology and gentleness – always suspect that they aren’t very good. It seems one cannot both be a good person and at the same time feel blameless or pure inside. Goodness is, one might say, the unique consequence of a keen and ongoing awareness of one’s capacity to be bad – that is, to be thoughtless, foolish, cruel, self-righteous and ignorant of the legitimate needs of others. Only on the basis of a perpetual, vigilant impression that one hasn’t got the right to judge oneself above suspicion does one come anywhere near the ethical high standard that merits the title of ‘good’. The price of being genuinely good is the constant idea that one might be a monster – combined with a fundamental hesitation about labelling anyone else monstrous. A guilty conscience is the bedrock of virtue – and all this comes easily to the failed.</p>
<p>Generally, it never occurs to the most difficult or dangerous people on the planet that they might be lacking. Their sickness is to locate evil always firmly outside of themselves: it’s invariably the ‘others’ who are to blame, the others who are cruel, sinful, lacking in judgement and mistaken. Their job is to take these impure people down and correct their evils in the fire of their own righteousness. The failed don’t go in for this. Their sense of uncleanliness is an insurance policy against further evil. It is a grim paradox, therefore, that some of the worst deeds that humans have ever been guilty of have been carried out by people with an easy conscience; people who felt they were definitely on the side of angels, people who were entirely sure that they had justice in hand. What unites the people who report their neighbours to the secret police, the crowds who burn their victims at stakes while dancing around their agonised bodies, the government officials who set up purification camps and the nations that wipe out their enemies with special barbarism is their consistent and overwhelming sense that they are doing the right thing – in the eyes of God, history or truth. When trying to understand why people do evil things, we should never start from the position that they understood them as evil; they carried out their nastiness cocksure that they were paragons. An impassioned feeling of being the instrument of justice has been at the heart of humanity’s most appallingly unkind moments. The truly kind ones among us always readily forgive because they know how much in them needs to be forgiven.</p>
