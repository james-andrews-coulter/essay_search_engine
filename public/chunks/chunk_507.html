        <h3>¶ Long-Term Love</h3>
<p>Much of our collective thinking about love targets the problems we face around starting a relationship. To the Romantic, love essentially means ‘finding love’. What we blithely call a love story is mostly in fact the start of a love story.</p>
<p>Yet the true, heroic challenges of love are concerned with how to keep love going over the long term, in the face of hurdles not generally discussed in art and, as a result, lacking glamour: incompatible work schedules, differing ideas about bathroom etiquette, phone calls with ex-partners, waning lust, the demands of household management, business trips that clash with anniversaries, the question of whether and when to have children, divergent parenting styles, problematic in-laws and economic stresses.</p>
<p>To negotiate these challenges, long-term love requires us to develop a host of skills that our societies tend to stay quiet about: forgiveness, charity, humour, imagination and seeing the other as a loveable idiot (rather than simply a disappointment). To love over time involves striving to understand what another person is really trying to say when they are upset, even if what they are uttering is on the surface shockingly disdainful. It might involve discovering the dignity of domestic chores or a melancholy acceptance that a good relationship might require the sacrifice of certain dreams of sexual fulfilment. We’ll have to say sorry even if we are not really at fault; we’ll have to tell many little white lies and occasionally rather large ones; we’ll have to face the fact that we’ll discover some grim shortcomings in the other person, and they in us.</p>
<p>Realistic, scratchy, long-term love is diametrically at odds with the Romantic vision of being in love. Therefore, by the standards of Romantic love, it has to look like an unfolding catastrophe. Far from it: it is what naturally happens when love is reciprocated and when decent, normal people live side by side for a long time. It is part of what good ordinary relationships look like over the years. It is what happens when love succeeds.</p>
