<p>DETACHMENT &amp; ANXIETY</p>
<p>The majority of our lives requires us to be heavily invested in our own ego, its pleasures, sufferings and ambitions. But we are also capable, at rare moments, of accessing a mood of detachment in which what exactly happens to us, who we are and what we are capable of cease to be of such primary and tortuous concern – and we are able to look out at the world as if we were not so condemned to be so tightly connected to ourselves.</p>
<p>In such moods of detachment, which can take place particularly at night, often in the vastness of nature, practical concerns are, for a time, kept wholly at bay and we accede to an unnerving yet thrillingly oblique perspective on existence. We might be driving down a deserted motorway or looking down at the earth from a plane tracing its way across Greenland. It might be high summer or a deep winter evening. The essential element is that we are able to look ‘beyond the ego’. Helped along by the sound of flowing water or the call of a distant owl, the habitual struggle ceases, we are freed from our customary egoistic vigilance and we can do a properly extraordinary thing: look at life as if we were not us, as if we were a roaming eye that could inhabit the perspective of anyone or anything else, a foreigner or a child, a crab on a seashore or a cloud on the hazy horizon. In our detached state, the ‘I’, the vessel that we are usually supremely and exhaustively loyal to, ceases to be our primary responsibility. We can take our leave and become a roaming, vagabond, promiscuous thing, a visitor of other mentalities and modalities, as concerned with all that is not us as we are normally obsessed by what is.</p>
<p>As a result, a range of emotions that we would typically feel only in relation to us can be experienced around other elements too. We might feel the pain of someone we hardly know, or be gratified by the success of a stranger. We could take pride in a beauty or intelligence to which we were wholly unconnected. We can be imaginative participants in the entire cosmic drama.</p>
<p>There might, in all this, be a particular emphasis on love. That could sound odd, because we’re used to thinking of love in a very particular context, that of the circumscribed affection that one person might have for a very accomplished and desirable other. But understood properly, love involves a care and concern for anything at all. We might find ourselves loving – that is, appreciating and delighting in, understanding and sympathising with – a family of dung beetles or a moss-covered tundra, someone else’s child or the birth of a faraway star. An intensity of enthusiasm that we usually restrict to only one other nearby ego can be distributed more erratically and generously across the entire universe and all its life forms.</p>
<p>No longer so closely wedded to ourselves, we cease to worry overly about what might happen to our puny and vulnerable selves in the always uncertain future. We may be readier to give up on some of our jealously guarded and pedantically held goals. We may never get to quite where we want to go, but we are more prepared to bob on the eddies of life, content to let events buffet us as they may. We make our peace with the laws of entropy. We may never be properly loved or appropriately appreciated. We’ll die before everything has been achieved – and that will be OK.</p>
<p>And yet, at the same time, a particular gaiety might descend on us, for a huge amount of our energy is normally directed towards nursing our ego’s wounds and coping with what we deep down suspect is the utter indifference of others. But that no longer seems like a spectre we have to ward off and we can start to raise our eyes and notice life in a way we never otherwise do. Our invisibility and meaninglessness is a given we now joyfully accept, rather than angrily or fearfully rage against. We don’t quake in fear that we might not be a somebody; we embrace the full knowledge of our eternal nullity – and delight that, right now, the blossom looks truly enchanting in the field opposite.</p>
<p>We cannot persist at a detached plane at all times; there will inevitably be bills to be paid and children to be picked up. But the claims of the ordinary world do not invalidate or mock our occasional access to a more elevated and disinterested zone, in which the burden of being us is momentarily lifted and, with the usual thrum of anxiety stilled, we can pay due heed to what is always there, waiting for us to be in a state to notice: the wonder and beauty of existence.</p>
