        <h4>7. Being in Love</h4>
<p>Anthony Carthew: ‘And [you are], I suppose, in love?’</p>
<p>Lady Diana Spencer: ‘Of course!’</p>
<p>Charles, Prince of Wales: ‘Whatever “in love” means.’</p>
<p>(ITN INTERVIEW ON THE ENGAGEMENT OF CHARLES AND DIANA, 1981)</p>
<p>I am a huge believer not only in the possibility but also the wisdom of falling in love. It’s a magical, sparkly feeling. The world seems bright and shiny, the future
  seems glorious, everything seems possible. Yes, being in love can sometimes be hard – as the classic French ballad has it, ‘the pleasure of love lasts a moment, the pain of love lasts a
  lifetime.’ But the excitement, the arousal and the adoration are surely irresistible. Everyone should be love-struck at least once in their life.</p>
<p>Two examples. In Charles Dickens’s novel, the eponymous David Copperfield first meets Dora Spenlow when he visits her father’s house. ‘All was over . . . I was gone,
  headlong.’ There follows a delightful description of the ecstasy that comes with having ‘fulfilled my destiny . . . in an abyss of love.’</p>
<p>And in case we think that fiction always exaggerates reality, let us also recall footballer David Beckham’s equal wonderment at first seeing Victoria on a Spice Girls video: ‘I
  thought “she is . . . perfection”.’ Their later face-to-face meeting, at a charity football match, happily led to David’s infatuation being fully returned and an almost
  instant relationship, engagement and marriage.</p>
<p>Fixation</p>
<p>But what does being ‘in love’ have to do with effective relationship choice? In some ways, not a lot. In evolutionary terms, this rush of wonderful emotion was
  originally designed not to help us choose a compatible match, but to help us stand by a partner with whom we were making babies. Lust was there to get us rolling in the hay, being ‘in
  love’ was there to make us willing to push the pram alongside the one we’d originally sneaked off to the barn with. The ‘in love’ flurry of the hormones known as
  ‘monoamines’ exists to focus us on partnership through those early years when offspring need us to stay close, to the exclusion of all else. So much so that research at the University
  of Pisa has found key similarities between the monoamine levels of new partners and those who suffer obsessive–compulsive disorder. When we fall for someone we become literally fixated on
  them – as David Copperfield describes it, ‘a captive and a slave’.</p>
<p>There’s a less evolutionary, more psychological and – in this age of family planning – less offspring-focussed set of reasons why ‘in love’ is so compelling.
  It’s that when we fall in love, we’re following an emotional dream of being the centre of the world. While very small, unless our childhood was damaged, those around us did their best
  to keep us absolutely safe, warm, cared for, loved. We leave that behind as we grow to adulthood, but we’ll always be looking for it again, always be wanting to recreate the security and the
  validation that was ours in the early years. ‘In love’ holds out the promise that our beloved will make us the centre of their world, and for ever. No wonder it’s an obsessive
  compulsion.</p>
<p>We build on that compulsion. When in love, we’re likely to spend huge amounts of time together – proximity, you may remember, strengthens attraction. We stay close, connecting
  through sex but also through matched body language, emotional revelation and deep eye contact. The effectiveness of those last two elements was fascinatingly demonstrated by psychologist Arthur
  Aron, who got previously unintroduced subjects falling head over heels with each other simply by having them ask each other a series of thirty-six self-disclosure questions, then gazing into one
  another’s eyes for a mere four minutes. This approach was later used in an experiment to raise the ‘take-up factor’ for speed daters – and indeed those daters who asked more
  personal questions and gave more revealing answers got more picks from the evening.</p>
<p>The wrong roller coaster?</p>
<p>The problem is that thereafter we may get stuck. For though I hate to be the bearer of bad news, none of that wonderful falling-in-love experience is guaranteed to produce
  long-term compatibility. Literature is riddled with stories of how initial adoration translates badly into ordinary everyday life: Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky; Madame Bovary and Rodolphe
  Boulanger; even Romeo and Juliet, if we believe Shakespeare’s hints that had they actually set up house together in Mantua, the result would have been something of a car crash.</p>
<p>It’s best to choose a roller-coaster ride that brings you back down to earth both safely and without nausea.</p>
<p>Giving more cause for concern – for literature does dramatize for the sake of a good yarn – there’s little scientific research showing a link between short-term attraction and
  long-term compatibility; Arthur Aron himself points out that while the closeness produced in his studies is similar to romantic passion, ‘it seems unlikely that the procedure produces . . .
  commitment.’ ‘In love’ might turn into a loss-leader for something deeper, but there’s no absolute correlation between the two.</p>
<p>There is, however, correlation between ‘in love’ and anxiety. Here’s another Arthur Aron experiment, this one involving eighty-five male subjects and a wobbly footbridge.
  Result: the men were significantly more likely to be charmed by a female researcher if they’d previously been scared out of their wits crossing the deep canyon at Capilano, Vancouver. (In
  case you’re suspecting gender bias here, the experiment was replicated some years later with women as subjects and male researchers; it produced the same outcome.) What both groups
  experienced was a dynamic that’s classic in the early stages of a relationship; our whole body is in a peak state of nervous tension, not only from wanting our beloved but also as a result of
  not knowing whether our beloved will want us. This arousal then provides the motivation to do exactly what we are genetically programmed to do, cling on to each other. Even the most delightful
  bonding involves some level of anxiety, and, in turn, anxiety often leads to bonding.</p>
<p>You can probably see where I’m going with this. We can easily confuse the strong emotion of the ‘in love’ kind with the strong emotion of more unhappy kinds. We may even find
  ourselves likely to bond in any uncertain situation, with any uncertain partner – one who is emotionally unreliable (‘I’ll phone you’ syndrome), one who is
  seriously uninterested (‘s/he’s just not into you’ syndrome), one who is terminally unavailable (‘it’s complicated’ syndrome). In fact, when we keep choosing
  unsatisfying partners, that might be not despite the fact but because of the fact that they are unsatisfying. If you recognize yourself in this scenario, don’t self-blame;
  there’s a very small distinction between an emotional roller coaster that makes us squeal with delight and one that makes us shriek with horror, and most of us at some time choose the wrong
  ride.</p>
<p>The earthquake of love</p>
<p>There’s something else we need to remember about ‘in love’. It’s date-stamped. That original flurry of addicted monoamines will in the end give way to a
  lower-key flow of the ‘cuddle hormone’ oxytocin, designed to give us a more secure connection and get us not just pushing the pram but setting up house and home until the kids have
  grown and flown. There’s a natural switch from high arousal to low-key stability, from excitement to steadiness, from absolute adoration to loving respect: as Louis de Bernières writes
  in his novel Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, ‘a temporary madness . . . an earthquake . . . then it subsides.’</p>
<p>Given this non-correlation between ‘in love’ and compatibility, it’s therefore wise to avoid making choices from the earthquake zone, wise to wait until the earth has stopped
  moving before we pitch permanent camp. As de Bernières suggests, at that point there is a decision to be made about whether we are so compatible, so committed that even without ‘in
  love’ we want to stay together. This stage beyond ‘in love’ may not feel as intensely exciting, but it’s what makes a relationship stay the course. ‘Love
  itself,’ says de Bernières, ‘is what is left over, when being in love has burned away.’ If we want a partner for the long term, we need to discover what is ‘left
  over’.</p>
<p>Here’s an exercise to help in the discovery. Pick three friends you’ve known for a while and are emotionally at ease with. Now think of what makes them your friends; think of what
  you get from them that has maintained your connection over time. Fix in your mind that feeling of being comfortable with them, relaxed in their company, authentically yourself, simply content. And
  there’s your point of reference, the touchstone to use when you fall in love. If you feel with a partner that same sense of comfort, relaxation, contentment – and if you sense that
  feeling could endure – then you are on safe ground.</p>
<p>Good navigation</p>
<p>Which unfortunately doesn’t mean that the ground will stay safe for ever. Yes, we’re always told that when we love we will not only live ‘happily’ but
  will do so ‘ever after’. We’re assured that, apart from when it’s absent, denied or ended, ‘love is a many-splendoured thing’, ‘love lifts us up where we
  belong’, ‘all you need is love’. And so we tend to set our compass for partner choice by the pole star of joy . . .</p>
<p>Often, that’s good navigation. If we choose a partner who complements us, who completes our jigsaw and adds their skills and strengths to the ones we lack, we’ll live a more
  effective but also a more contented life. In Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet, having spent most of the novel thinking that Darcy is ‘the last man on
  earth’ she would marry, realizes at last – and possibly too late – just how complementary they are and how happy their relationship could be. ‘It was a union that must have
  been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have
  received benefit of greater importance.’ (If you’ve never read the book, be reassured: they get together in the end.)</p>
<p>Similarly, if we choose a partner who supports us, who by their attention and responsiveness heals our emotional wounds and makes us whole, we’ll live a more fulfilled but also a more
  joyful life. Here is another Elizabeth, this time Elizabeth Barrett, writing to fellow poet Robert Browning after he has expressed his love for her: ‘To receive such a proof of attachment
  from you not only overpowers every present evil, but seems to me a full and abundant amends for the merely personal sufferings of my whole life. [My tears] went away in the moisture of new, happy
  tears. Henceforward I am yours.’ (If you don’t know the history, they married; he then helped her to not only bear lifelong illness and a family estrangement, but also fulfil her
  promise as a writer.)</p>
<p>People-growing</p>
<p>But despite these examples, love doesn’t make us happy all the time and every time. Maybe an adorable partner has a less-than-lovable phase, an easy relationship starts to
  feel like hard work, a future that was glorious slowly becomes ordinary or even disagreeable. In Dickens’s novel, David Copperfield finds it hard to come to terms with Dora’s naivety
  and impracticality, while David Beckham’s marriage has reportedly not been without its ups and downs. Faced with dissatisfaction, it’s not surprising that we start to question our
  judgement. Does our unhappiness mean we chose the wrong partner? And what does it mean about how we made our decision and whether we should renege?</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. A relationship is what psychologist David Schnarch, in his book Passionate Marriage, calls a ‘people-growing process’. It invites us to flourish by
  learning to overcome not just the problems of everyday life, but the specific problems that our partner and our partnership present. It invites us to step up to the challenge of becoming more
  tolerant, more patient, more loving than we were before, in order to cope with the one we love. (If this seems unfair, be reassured. It cuts both ways; a partner has to step up in order to cope
  with us.)</p>
<p>This challenge of people-growing is never going to be a constantly happy one. It can’t be. Poet David Whyte, in his work The Three Marriages, offers the metaphor of buying two
  houses in order to join them together – but instead of being able to simply knock down the walls, we have to demolish both houses completely so we can rebuild, and ‘from the razed
  foundations of our former individual [selves] make a new home’. Schnarch picks up on this metaphor but with an extra emotional challenge: that in order to do this we must become more loving
  not only to our partner, but to ourselves as well. We must be strong, self-contained, ‘secure’, comfortable in our own skin – for we need to feel ‘at home’ in
  ourselves in order to have ‘a good place to invite a spouse to visit’.</p>
<p>Standing in love</p>
<p>Both Whyte and Schnarch say the same – that this process is universal, that it is a good thing, that we need to welcome it as a way of maturing and developing, that
  long-term it will lead to happiness because it will help us thrive. Similarly, Erich Fromm, whom we met earlier in this book, says that falling in love is inevitably followed by a period of needing
  to ‘stand’ in love, if our relationship is to survive. Happiness will not necessarily be what marks progress; sometimes there will be pain.</p>
<p>A common response to all this is to swallow hard as one tries to come to terms with the shock revelation that even the most successful ‘love, sweet love’ doesn’t always feel so
  sweet. But there often follows a sigh of relief that relationship problems don’t imply that the partners are wrong for each other or that they necessarily need to separate. For even if we
  make the most perfect partner-pick in the world, we will at some point meet challenges. We will always be required to master the essential human balancing act of trying to answer our own needs
  while meeting those of our beloved, of loving ourselves while loving another, and of growing through that process.</p>
<p>So the key aim in finding the right partner should not be to try to avoid that balancing act – it’s inevitable – but to find someone for whose sake we’ll attempt the act
  because we love them so much, someone who loves us so much that they’ll make the attempt for our sake. The question for both sides becomes how to choose a partner who is so compelling that
  we’re willing to demolish our own house in order to rebuild a more beautiful mutual home.</p>
<p>Diamond-polishing</p>
<p>The good news is that we likely know how to choose correctly even when we’re not doing so deliberately. For humans are drawn towards those who help them grow; the message
  from Whyte, Schnarch and Fromm is that partner choice is the way we actively, though often unconsciously, choose to mature. Schnarch even likens it to the meeting of two flawless but rough diamonds
  that rub away every part of themselves that doesn’t fit in order to stay joined together. The end result is not only a loving relationship, but two sparkling jewels.</p>
<p>So, for example, we may be drawn to someone who needs something from us that we find it hugely difficult to deliver: attention even when they are angry, energy even when we are drained,
  emotional control in the face of difficult circumstances. Over time, because we care, we learn to step up and meet these challenges – and in this way develop a part of ourselves we would
  otherwise never have developed.</p>
<p>Or, we may pair with someone who – once the rose-coloured glasses are off – manifests some vulnerability or fault that we dislike, or even deny, in ourselves. Because love means we
  are motivated to understand and accept that partner, we learn to accept and understand our own vulnerabilities – and so we thrive.</p>
<p>More unexpectedly, perhaps – for more explanation of this, reread Chapter 3 – we may find someone whose personality reflects that of someone from our early past with whom we’ve
  had a complicated relationship. That reflection may make our current relationship complicated – but given that we are now older and more mature, we may learn to relate to our partner in a way
  we never could to the original. We may grow up sufficiently to create a happy ending this time round.</p>
<p>Take some time to think back to past relationships with partners (or friends, or family) where things were challenging but left you changed for the better, even in small ways. You’ve
  almost certainly, in those relationships, chosen to be with people who helped you with the diamond-polishing. So what did those relationships give you? What benefits have you gained? And what can
  you learn that will help you begin – and maintain – your future partnership?</p>
<p>The right order</p>
<p>How can we tell whether a partner will help us mature in these ways and whether we can help them in return? There’s no formula, no guaranteed way of discovering if someone
  constitutes our growth opportunity – and as with attachment tendencies, real evidence may only be possible when the relationship’s well beyond the point of first choosing.</p>
<p>But in the earlier going, certain signs are encouraging: feeling ourselves becoming more emotionally truthful, and seeing our partner becoming equally more authentic; feeling encouraged by them
  to reach our potential, and being able to encourage them to do the same; finding ourselves both learning and teaching, like Elizabeth Bennet; or finding ourselves emotionally healing and
  professionally achieving, like Elizabeth Barrett. In her novel Beloved, the author Toni Morrison describes this kind of personal development as if the person in question were a jumble of
  jigsaw pieces, taken up by a partner, rearranged and returned ‘in all the right order’. If we have chosen well, both partners may find their ‘pieces’ falling into place.</p>
<p>The sparkle</p>
<p>The lesson of this chapter is not that we should choose a partner with whom things are tough from the very beginning – if that’s what’s going on, it’s
  not the right relationship. The lesson is that the best love is a three-part process, with the initial delights driving us on to ride out the medium-term challenges for the sake of long-term
  rewards. To complete the stories with which we began this chapter, David and Victoria Beckham are near to celebrating two decades together, while David Copperfield learned to accept his
  wife’s failings and so allowed his marriage to gain stability, even if it was cut short by Dora’s death.</p>
<p>Enough, then, of any alarm bells. My original statement of belief in love still stands, and more. Because, firstly, whether or not a relationship lasts, being love-struck may be worth it just
  for the experience. And, secondly, if the relationship does last, love-struck is a wonderful place to start. The very fact we are so drawn to someone else – the lure of the obsession –
  is a huge motivator to stay loyal if things become challenging. The fact that we want so much from a partner means we’re driven to deliver in return. The fact that ‘falling in
  love’ means we bond, connect, open up, reveal and respond to each other emotionally creates the foundation for ‘standing in love’ further down the line. If what’s left after
  the earthquake subsides is a solid core of commitment, then we have the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>So let’s embrace the romance, let’s enjoy the passion. In short, bring on the sparkle.</p>
