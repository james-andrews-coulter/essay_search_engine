        <h3>¶ Crying with Art</h3>
<p>Sometimes works of art move us to tears. We might think this is because what they’re showing us is sad, but there’s something more peculiar at work. Often, we start crying not when things are horrible, but when they are suddenly and unexpectedly the opposite: when they are unusually sweet, tender, joyful, innocent or kind. Weeping in such circumstances is puzzling, but tells us something important: it’s a sign of how hard our lives have become.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a film a father who has been bullying or distant one day turns shyly to his son and admits: ‘I always loved you; I never knew how to tell you this; I’m so sorry.’ Or in a story we’re reading to a child, there might be a page where the penguin tells its friend: ‘I will never leave you as long as I live … ’</p>
<p>We cry when art reminds us of what we long for (forgiveness, reconciliation, loyalty) and when it prompts us to remember what we lack. Art evokes all the lost innocence of the world and of our own lives, against which the toughness of things stands out more acutely. The loveliness and goodness on display in art can make the actual ugliness of our existence all the more vivid. We cry at poignant reminders of an elusive paradise, at what we crave for and have been exiled from.</p>
<p>If we were to try creating a robot that could cry at films, with books or at the museum, we would have to do something apparently rather cruel: we would have to ensure that this robot knew about suffering, that it was able to hate itself, to feel confused and frustrated, to ache and hope that it didn’t have to ache. It is against this kind of background of pain and sober maturity that beautiful scenes in films or works of art become important rather than merely nice. Our tears tell us something key: that our lives are tougher than they were when we were little, and that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is correspondingly all the more intense.</p>
