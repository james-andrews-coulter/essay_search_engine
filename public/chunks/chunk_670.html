        <h3>¶ Secularisation</h3>
<p>Secularisation is the process whereby humanity has gradually divested itself of its long-held beliefs in deities and gods. Almost all of the world’s most developed countries have, over the past century, undergone a significant process of secularisation. Religions that were once immensely influential across the whole of society now usually have only tiny bands of faithful adherents.</p>
<p>It might be assumed that secularisation logically involves one thing only: proving the non-existence of a god and then ridding the world of everything related to religion.</p>
<p>But there may be a different way to approach secularisation – a nuance that relates back to the dual identity of religions. Aside from their grandly speculative notions about the origins of the universe and the survival of the soul after death, religions have also been the carriers of a range of useful and important psychological ideas. Religions have been engaged in two tasks: to make us faithful and to make us wise.</p>
<p>For long periods of history, religions were involved not only in metaphysical speculations, but also in what we would now call emotional education. They foregrounded forgiveness, charity, community, ritual gratitude, honesty about one’s failings, generosity towards the weak and a rejection of money as the ultimate measure of the worth of individuals.</p>
<p>Religions were also astonishingly inventive about how to bring this emotional education about. They didn’t just deliver dry lectures in ugly classrooms. They deployed the greatest artists in the world to make their views of the well-lived life seductively convincing; they built the finest buildings and commissioned the greatest art in an attempt to get difficult messages about kindness, generosity, humility and sorrow to lodge firmly in our souls. They mined the power of ritual: they realised how repetition, rules, special clothes, sacred foods and days, words and gestures might help our leaky brains retain important ideas.</p>
<p>The true task of secularisation is to steal from the educational techniques of religions while disregarding (most of) their content. Religions are intermittently too creative, interesting and useful to be abandoned merely to those who happen to believe in them. The priority is to rescue some of what is still wise, inspiring and relevant from all that is no longer true.</p>
