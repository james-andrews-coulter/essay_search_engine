        <h2>VULNERABILITY</h2>
<p>The impulse, when things are darkening, is to hide away and reduce communication. We are too ashamed to do anything else. We should fight the tendency and, precisely when we cannot bear to admit what we are going through, we should dare to take someone into our confidence. Silence is the primordial enemy. We have to fight a permanent feeling that we are too despicable to be looked after. We have to take a gamble on an always implausible idea: that we deserve kindness.</p>
<p>LOVE</p>
<p>Love is ultimately what will get us through—not romantic love but sympathy, tolerance, and patience. We’ll need to watch our tendencies to turn down love from an innate sense of unworthiness. We wouldn’t have become ill if it were entirely easy for us to accept the positive attention of others. We’ll have to thank those who are offering it, make them feel appreciated in return and, most of all, accept that from the outset our illness was rooted in a deficit of love and therefore that every encounter with love will strengthen our recovery and help keep the darkness at bay.</p>
<p>PILLS</p>
<p>Ideally, we would of course prefer not to keep adding foreign chemicals to our minds. There are side effects and the eerie sense of not knowing exactly where our thoughts end and alien neurochemistry begins. But the medicines set up guardrails around the worst of our mental whirlpools. We may have to be protected on an ongoing basis from forces inside us that would prefer we didn’t exist.</p>
