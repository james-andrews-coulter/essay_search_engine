        <h3>¶ Romantic</h3>
<p>Romanticism is a movement of art and ideas that began in Europe in the mid-18th century and has now taken over the world. It is hard to go far on almost any issue without encountering a dominant Romantic position.</p>
<p>At the core of the Romantic attitude is a trust in feeling and instinct as supreme guides to life, and a corresponding suspicion of reason and analysis. In relation to love, this inspires a belief that passionate emotions will reliably guide us to a partner who can provide us with fifty years or so of intimate happiness. It also leads to a veneration of sex as the ultimate expression of love (a position that turns adultery from a problem into a disaster). In relation to work, the Romantic spirit leads to a faith in spontaneous ‘genius’ and a trust that all talented people will experience the pull of a vocation. In social life, Romanticism argues against politeness and convention and in favour of frankness and plain speaking. It assumes that children are pure and good, and that it is only ever society that corrupts them. Romanticism hates institutions and venerates the brave outsider who fights heroically against the status quo. It likes what is new rather than recurring. The Romantic spirit pits itself against analysis; it believes there is such a thing as ‘thinking too much’ (rather than just thinking badly). It doesn’t favour logic or discourse. Music is its favourite artistic medium. It is offended by what is humdrum and ordinary and longs for the special, the rare, the distinctive and the exclusive. It likes revolution rather than evolution. The Romantic attitude disdains organisation, punctuality, clarity, bureaucracy, industry, commerce and routine. It admits that these things are necessary, but considers them ‘un-Romantic’: miserable impositions forced upon us by the unfortunate conditions of existence.</p>
<p>Eugène Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People, 1830.</p>
<p>An invitation to Romanticism.</p>
<p>The supreme symbol of the Romantic attitude is Eugène Delacroix’s legendary painting Liberty Leading the People.</p>
<p>Romanticism has its distinctive wisdom, but in many areas its central messages have become a catastrophic liability in our lives. They push us in decisively unhelpful directions; they incite unreal hopes, make us impatient with ourselves, discourage introspection, blind us to the dangers of obeying instinct in love and work, turn us away from our realities and lead us to lament the normal conditions of existence.</p>
<p>The huge task of our age is to unwind Romantic attitudes and replace them with an outlook that might, for the sake of symmetry and historical accuracy, be called Classical.</p>
