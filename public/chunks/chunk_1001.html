        <h2>DARK PREMEDITATIONS</h2>
<p>It is customary to be upbeat when a marriage is announced. Society wants to stress how happy the couple will be; it tries to raise their spirits and build up their hopes. This feels like a kind and generous thing to do, but in reality, optimism has some hugely unfortunate consequences. It means that central aspects of the reality of a shared life will come as a brutal disappointment, for which a couple will be unprepared and to which they are liable to react with bitterness and fury. Carefully wielded pessimism turns out to be one of the greatest gifts of contented couples.</p>
<p>In a wiser culture, people entering marriage would be strongly encouraged to contemplate the sorrows likely to come their way. This wouldn’t stop them getting together; it would correctly ready them for what they were trying to do. If two people were going to start on an expedition up an extremely high mountain, it would be neither kind nor useful for a guide to suggest the climb would be undemanding when, in reality, they were going to be facing ice walls, over-hangs, exhaustion, minus-forty-degree nights and cataclysmic storms sweeping in without warning from innocent blue skies.</p>
<p>When things get tough in a marriage, the greatest temptation is to feel that the difficulties stem from having chosen the wrong partner. If we are guided by an underlying optimism around what marriage is supposed to be like, we will stay loyal to our naive ideas of love while growing highly disloyal to the particular lover with whom we have attempted to enact them.</p>
<p>To inoculate ourselves against curdled sentimentality, we need to perform a series of exercises, termed ‘pre-meditations’, which systematically investigate the darker scenarios we may have to face. These are not to be confused with predictions: considering them doesn't make them happen, it simply renders us grateful if we skirt them. A good marriage isn’t one free of difficulties; it is one in which the difficulties have been factored in, have been understood to stem from the inherent complexities of what is being attempted and are not interpreted by either party as a violation of a beatific original contract.</p>
<p>i. Money</p>
<p>Money will always be trouble. It is impossible that it won’t be, because money is never just about money: it is an ultimate symbol of affection. Even if there is technically money in a joint account, there can still be an intense feeling of having been robbed when a relationship is under stress. Any feeling of being emotionally neglected can become identified with financial ebbs and flows. It is almost impossible to be in a committed relationship and not, at some level, be facing periods of anxiety or quiet rage around cash.</p>
<p>The standard advice tends to be procedural and sunny: we are told to be transparent, to keep receipts and to open a shared accounts book in which we both jot down expenses. It won’t work – not because we are with the wrong person, but because money is fiendishly linked to the broader spectrum of our psychology. Thanks to our background and past experience, we might see money as the key mark of dignity, or as utterly unrelated to what is truly important in life. We may carry the burdens of parents who were overly impressed by wealth or of a family that felt economically humiliated. It is exceptionally unlikely that two people will ever have the same deep and detailed attitudes to money. Therefore, money will very likely become a major point of contention – not because we are with the wrong person but because we are with another person.</p>
<p>The right attitude is to understand that money can’t help but be a difficult theme, and not to become too alarmed when conflicts emerge. Crucially, we should not concentrate on the money issues themselves, but seek to grasp why they are so powerful on both sides. We need to see, compassionately and accurately, what their emotional resonance is. We need to investigate our own less than fully conscious psychological legacy. That won’t make a shortage of money go away or remove a structural imbalance in resources between two people. But it provides an avenue of understanding. Instead of merely getting angry, we can grasp the conflict as an essential part of what marriage involves. A decent marriage isn’t one that has no money angst but one in which two people genuinely try to make sense of the psychological sources of their inevitable financial quirks.</p>
<p>ii. Sex</p>
<p>If extraordinary sex is a priority, we should never get married. The largest generalisation we can make of marriage is that sex will decline within it. This isn’t a sign that we have made a mistake, but that we are succeeding at long-term commitment.</p>
<p>Sex rewards adventure, risk, naughtiness, a lack of barriers and novelty. But a good marriage is based around stability, continuity, a degree of guardedness and carefully monitored boundaries.</p>
<p>That is why, over a marriage, we are bound to experience a range of frustrations and let-downs. We and our partner will both be sexually curious about other people, but both be appalled by the possibility of the other’s vagabond attention. We will have to keep most of what we imagine and long for secret. We will either feel rejected by their lack of interest or humiliated by the intensity of their demands. Far from being the ideal expression of mutual love, sex will become a battlefield of grievances, reproaches and bitterness. It will, most evenings, feel much easier just to read a book.</p>
<p>What makes sexual conflict far harder to deal with than it should be is the natural but unfair idea that the pain might be someone’s fault – perhaps one’s own but far more likely one’s partner’s. In truth, it is not the result of anyone being pointedly awful. The horror arises because of the unfortunate and manifold complications of human sexuality, for which neither party is ever overly responsible.</p>
<p>iii. Childcare</p>
<p>Having children promises us some of the greatest joys of marriage, but also offers us the most reliable route to wrecking a relationship. It vastly expands the range of topics over which two people can argue and feel resentful. It is highly unlikely that one will be able to bring up children one adores without in some way reducing the love one ends up feeling for one’s fellow parent.</p>
<p>The reasons are endless. For years (it could be only seven, but it will feel like eternity), it will be almost impossible to sleep or even to think properly. There will be yogurt on the back of the kitchen chairs. There will be anguished moments when a small baby is ill, urgently in need of something, screaming, brightly but oddly coloured – and unable to let on as to what should be done. The intensity of our love for our child will increase the stakes in every disagreement with our spouse: we will find we are at odds over sleeping habits, the role of in-laws, how tolerant or demanding to be, how much ice cream it’s acceptable to eat, and how a child should behave in a restaurant. A lot will go wrong with our child and we’ll know who to blame: our partner who will have been too protective or too careless; too indulgent or too strict; too much in thrall to experts or too rejecting of expert opinion. Instead of our shared love for our child being something that draws us ever more deeply together, it will prove a tortured zone of contention. We’ll feel certain that we’d split up if it wasn’t for the children – although it’s primarily the presence of children that will render the idea of divorce so attractive.</p>
<p>A better and wiser attitude to childcare starts from the idea that we are not attempting to create a perfect human being. We will be far from flawless parents, and this matters not a jot. The mid-20thcentury English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who specialised in working with parents and children, was disturbed by how often he encountered in his consulting rooms parents who were deeply disappointed with themselves. They felt they were failing as parents and hated themselves as a result. They were ashamed of their occasional rows, their bursts of short temper, their times of boredom around their own child, their many mistakes. They were haunted by a range of anxious questions: are we too strict, too lenient, too protective, not protective enough? What struck Winnicott, however, was that these people were almost always not at all bad parents. They were not, by some fantasy ideal, perfect, but they were – as he came to put it, rather wonderfully – ‘good enough’.</p>
<p>And ‘good enough’, strangely, is even better than ‘perfect’, because a child will need to live the rest of their lives in a very imperfect world. It is good for them to get used to the idea of error early on. The good enough parent is at times irate, stupid, a bit unfair, rather tired and a touch depressed. And in so being, they are doing something truly valuable for the child: preparing them for reality.</p>
<p>iv. Being entirely honest</p>
<p>For years, you felt burdened with thoughts, feelings and opinions that didn’t seem to make much sense to anyone else. There were people you didn’t like, but everyone else seemed to think they were terrific, so you held your tongue. There were things you would have liked to try in bed, but they felt shameful and you kept quiet about them. You learnt to have secrets in order to be liked. Then, finally, you met a very special person. What made them so special was that you no longer had to dissemble around them. You could admit to important truths. You could confess, and be rewarded for sharing, your deepest self. It was a favourite game in the early months. You pushed yourself to go as far as you could. The deeper the secret, the better. No area of the self seemed beyond investigation, no secret too shocking or explicit. You could explain that you found a mutual acquaintance arrogant, narcissistic and mean. Or that you thought some supposed ‘masterpiece’ of a book very boring. You could explain that you liked pulling hair during sex or had always been excited by ropes. Love seemed to be born out of a possibility for new honesty. What had previously been taboo gave way to exhilarating intimacy.</p>
<p>The relief of honesty is at the heart of the feeling of being in love. A sense of mutual conspiracy underlies the touch of pity that every new couple feels for the rest of humanity. But this sharing of secrets sets up in our minds – and in our collective culture – a powerful and potentially problematic ideal: that if two people love one another, they must always tell each other the truth about everything.</p>
<p>The idea of honesty is sublime. It presents a deeply moving vision of how two people can be together, and it is a constant presence in the early months. But there is a problem: we keep wanting to make this same demand as the relationship goes on. And yet in order to be kind, and in order to sustain the relationship over decades, it ultimately becomes necessary to keep a great many thoughts out of sight. We are perhaps too conscious of the bad reasons for hiding something; we haven’t paid enough attention to the noble reasons why, from time to time, true loyalty may lead one to say very much less than the whole truth.</p>
<p>We are so impressed by honesty that we have forgotten the virtues of politeness – this word defined not as a cynical withholding of important information for the sake of harm, but as a dedication to not rubbing someone up against the true, hurtful aspects of one’s nature. It is ultimately no great sign of kindness to insist on showing someone one’s entire self at all times. Repression, a certain degree of restraint, and a dedication to editing one’s pronouncements belongs to love as much as a capacity for explicit confession. The person who cannot tolerate secrets, who in the name of ‘being honest’ shares information so wounding it cannot be forgotten, is no friend of love. Just as no parent tells a child the whole truth, so we should accept the ongoing need to edit our full reality. And if one suspects (and one should, rather regularly, if the relationship is a good one) that one’s partner might be lying too (about what they are thinking about, about how they judge one’s work, about where they were last night), it is perhaps best not to take up arms and lay into them like a relentless inquisitor, however intensely one yearns to do that. It may be kinder, wiser and perhaps more in the true spirit of love, to pretend that one simply didn’t notice.</p>
