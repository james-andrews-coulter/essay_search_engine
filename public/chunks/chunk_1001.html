        <h4>8. Knowing</h4>
<p>Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others.</p>
<p>(JANE AUSTEN, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY)</p>
<p>The question we’re most likely to ask ourselves when we begin to date is ‘How will I know?’ What this really implies is two questions, ‘how’ and
  ‘when’: ‘How and when will I know enough to choose this person, or to not choose them, or to decide that the moment of choice is past?’ Let me say from the start that
  there’s no answer here, nor are there guarantees that one ever will know. All we can do is explore the possibilities.</p>
<p>Instant reaction</p>
<p>Possibility number one is that the answer to ‘how will I know?’ is ‘sheer gut reaction’ and the answer to ‘when will I know?’ is
  ‘instantly’. Eyes meet across a crowded room and the deal is sealed; as examples, see two separate if very different American presidents. In his memoirs, Bill Clinton reports that when
  his wife Hillary first spoke to him, he was so overwhelmed that he forgot his own name. Lyndon B. Johnson apparently asked ‘Lady Bird’, as his wife was known, for a date within minutes
  of meeting, and proposed at the end of that first date; they were still happily wed when he died almost forty years later.</p>
<p>Of course, an instant and instinctive decision about partner suitability is often a vote against – the elimination principle at work. Which is why, if all other boxes are ticked,
  it’s often wise to follow up even the most disastrous first meeting with a replay. That allows us to gather more, and more accurate, evidence – as well as reducing self-consciousness on
  both sides, allowing prospective partners to shine. This advice was passed on to me by a colleague who judged her blind date to be socially incompetent but gave him the benefit of a second hearing.
  She soon discovered he was simply overawed by her, a trait which soon transformed itself into socially competent adoration on both sides.</p>
<p>Then there’s the opposite danger. Over-speedy decisions can lead to being totally swept off one’s feet by beauty and charm, only to realize that one’s given house-room to a
  monster. That said, as I’ve confessed, I’m no enemy of a little carefully managed infatuation. And the danger’s often resolved by the inevitable removal of rose-coloured glasses
  – inevitable because such instant passion is likely to implode at the first sniff of a problem; as Shakespeare put it, ‘These violent delights have violent ends / . . . like fire and
  powder / Which as they kiss, consume.’ But if instant enchantment makes us want to instantly commit in some comparatively irreversible way (mortgage, marriage, motherhood) then it’s
  best to apply the necessary brakes.</p>
<p>Taking time</p>
<p>Bill Clinton may have been so overwhelmed by Hillary that his brain stopped working, but the ‘how’ of knowing is normally more thoughtful. And it’s usual to
  take longer than Lyndon Johnson’s few minutes to decide that we have found our life partner; radioactivity pioneer Marie Curie, for instance, turned down husband Pierre’s proposals a
  full seven times before she was convinced. Taking at least some time, space and consideration typically works best because it helps us to discover more about a partner, allows them to discover more
  about us. Where possible, dig deeper, search wider, allow both logic and emotion, head and heart to synchronize. As the Russian proverb runs, ‘Trust, but verify’.</p>
<p>Which is why communities have traditionally built in delay: long engagements, no sex before marriage, betrothal for a year and a day before the wedding proper, all so we can verify the
  information and draw a considered conclusion. Our contemporary speedy courtship rituals – sleeping together without vows, moving in together without documentation – are only acceptable
  because we’re now not bound together for life if love turns to hate. Ironically, the most modern method, online dating, has reintroduced some of that traditional delay, with users going
  through a sometimes lengthy and in-depth process of ‘getting to know you’ while they continue to ‘get to know’ several others online until they commit.</p>
<p>But it’s also best not to be too slow and too considered, for there are dangers in hesitation; we may lose not only momentum but also faith. Especially in the key transition stages –
  having sex, becoming monogamous, moving in – if the moment passes, so too may the belief that it was a good idea. If you’re worried about a timetable be reassured that, as the Jane
  Austen quotation at the beginning of this chapter shows, there is no ideal. That said, as very rough guidelines, two months of regular dating is long enough to know whether both sides want to
  declare themselves partners, two years long enough to know whether lifetime commitment is possible. Pass those breakpoints and it’s justifiable to question the length of the journey.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>So take stock. What is your journey to knowing? Do you rush into connection, physical or emotional, with spontaneous eagerness, enthusiasm and a marked inability either to doubt
  or to tolerate delayed gratification? Or do you progress so slowly and serenely in affairs of the heart that onlookers – or even the objects of your affection themselves – believe
  you’re ambivalent? In other words, do you typically push for commitment because you’re so quickly convinced that you’ve found perfection, or delay it because you’re waiting
  for perfection to prove itself?</p>
<p>There is an argument here for acting against usual tendencies. Previous speedy commitment may have led to some lack of judgement, previous tardy commitment may have meant losing love. And, as
  the old saying goes, ‘If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always got.’ So if we normally rush in, then, without playing ‘treat
  ’em mean and keep ’em keen’, we could maybe try holding back on that first kiss, that first sexual encounter, that first meeting with parents, until we know precisely what
  we’re dealing with. Conversely, if we typically tend to hesitate, then, without playing ‘wear your heart on your sleeve’, we could maybe ‘lean in’ to suggesting that
  date, supplying that extra front-door key, declaring those intentions – even before it feels completely comfortable. Altering approach is, as always, a challenge. But perhaps if you do what
  you’ve never done, you might get what you’ve never before got.</p>
<p>One of the nicest, as well as one of the most effective, ways to make a partnership decision – which involves taking time to explore but doesn’t drag things out – was suggested
  by my colleague Dr Charley Ferrer. Its approach is based not so much on information-gathering or timing as on attitude. For ninety days, Dr Ferrer advises, we should commit completely. We
  shouldn’t hold back for fear of being taken for granted, shouldn’t cling on for fear of being rejected. Instead, for a full three months, we should offer full engagement in giving and
  taking, full emotional responsiveness, full trust that the partnership will continue. In other words, we should behave as if we already ‘know’ and have already chosen. If after that
  time we have no hesitations, then we know enough to say a completely wholehearted ‘yes’. If at the end of the ninety days we are still hesitating, we have gained more than enough
  knowledge to justify a ‘no’.</p>
<p>Saying no</p>
<p>In some cases that ‘no’ is obvious. Deceit. Infidelity. Drug dependency. Abuse. Violence. All these bad behaviours are perfectly good reasons to flee, even after
  making an initial choice.</p>
<p>There can also be good reason to flee when there’s no bad behaviour at all. There are numerous partner combinations that don’t augur well: deal-breakers in our preferences; differing
  values, goals, personalities; questions about one’s enjoyment of a partner’s company; a not-quite-good-enough sex life; an annoying level of conflict (even if it is generally bearable).
  As Ross from the TV comedy Friends commented when asked why he and lesbian Carol weren’t together: ‘This is not a mix-and-match situation’, and we shouldn’t attempt
  to make round holes accommodate square pegs. (We equally, of course, shouldn’t simply walk away in an attempt to force the pegs into the holes; break-up rarely works as a way to compel
  commitment in ourselves or others, and even if we reconcile, such abandonment will always strain the partnership, sometimes irreversibly.)</p>
<p>Sometimes too, the answer is neither to go nor to stay but to try the third alternative. Change. If the benefits of partnership are obvious, we could – kindly, supportively, specifically
  – ask for the adjustments we want. Our partner might then answer – willingly, readily, enthusiastically – that they’re happy to oblige. Or vice versa. If that’s the
  conversation, there’s good reason to stay.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, without that conversation, there’s every reason to go. Professor Ted Huston’s fourteen-year couple study, mentioned earlier in this book, found that when women
  in the courting phase of a relationship predict future problems, their predictions usually come true. So if we decide to stay with someone in the hope they’ll improve in time, we’re not
  really committing to the person they are now but to a future ideal that’s highly improbable. As Albert Einstein – who was something of a philosopher as well as a theoretical physicist
  – famously commented, ‘Men marry women with the hope they will never change. Women marry men with the hope they will change. Invariably they are both disappointed.’</p>
<p>If having done due diligence we still feel a quiver of doubt, we could stay one more day to make absolutely sure. But if what we feel at the thought of staying is a flinch, a nausea, an
  exhaustion, that’s our unconscious screaming ‘go’. In which case, let me offer you an absolving ‘get out of jail free’ card. It is fine to turn someone down. In fact,
  it’s actually best to turn them down if you have come to the conclusion that they aren’t for you. Because by walking away you’re not just freeing yourself to find someone you can
  love. You are also freeing your no-longer-potential partner to find someone who can love them. Don’t feel guilty. If we know our heart is not in a relationship we do right by everyone if we
  leave.</p>
<p>Not being chosen</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the situation’s more complex. Our heart is in, fully in. But our feelings aren’t returned – or perhaps worse, not returned right now but
  with a hint that they might be at some future time. Then things become hugely more difficult – though this is also a timeless theme in our history and culture. The poet Dante’s love for
  Beatrice. The Hunchback of Notre Dame’s longing for Esmerelda. Mark in Love Actually standing before his ideal (but already happily married) partner with a poster reading ‘my
  wasted heart will always love you’. These tales touch us – and not only because we prefer a good ending to our love stories but also because they trigger a human terror that began when
  we were born: that we will not get everything we want in life.</p>
<p>Dante and Beatrice. Sometimes, there’s nothing more comfortable than focussing our choice on a prospect who, because we will never have them, will never
      disappoint us or be disappointed by us.</p>
<p>However unfulfilled a relationship – Dante loved Beatrice for life, but only met her twice – not being chosen is a blow. If, or when, it happens to us, we shouldn’t
  underestimate the impact; studies have equated this loss to an actual physical attack, a trauma, a bereavement. Then we need to cling to the fact that – given some weeping and wailing, but
  also given time, human support and a sense of perspective – we will likely move through the suffering.</p>
<p>But if we don’t move through rejection, we can land in deep trouble. For sometimes the label ‘non-available’ spurs us to even more commitment; surely if we can be different,
  woo more successfully, offer more resources, deliver more favours or simply try harder, we will get what we want.</p>
<p>Here the cautionary tale from literature is the Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s millionaire hero who invests everything he has in trying to rekindle the love of Daisy Buchanan’s
  ‘beautiful little fool’. He takes a luxurious mansion directly across the bay from her marital home, spends endless nights staring over at the green light at the end of her dock, throws
  hugely extravagant parties to tempt her to come to him.</p>
<p>It’s clear from the start that there will be no happy ending here; Daisy’s self-absorption makes it almost inevitable that, while she does restart her affair with Gatsby, she will in
  the end abandon him. But Gatsby himself creates his own tragedy by sacrificing all to win the love of someone who cannot truly love him, squandering his fortune in relentless decadence, abandoning
  his values and in the end losing his life to protect Daisy. The whole story is shot through with the pointlessness of clinging on in hope.</p>
<p>If our love story ever approaches that of Gatsby, the answer is not to twist our hearts and our souls out of shape as he did, but conversely to be even more authentic than usual. If after a
  while we are still not loved, then however much we mourn, it’s been a lucky escape. In the same way as it’s best to free up a partner we don’t want, it is also best to be freed
  from a partner who doesn’t want us. We deserve more than that.</p>
<p>Being chosen</p>
<p>What if, instead, we are adored without adoring in return? If our immediate reaction to being picked is obvious repulsion, that’s fairly straightforward; there likely
  follows a few embarrassing conversations, a little self-reproach and the occasional need to repel the boarder in question.</p>
<p>More difficult is when our reaction is not repulsion but temptation. For being the object of desire can be highly seductive. If we suffer the normal human tendency to self-negation, it may feel
  very good indeed when someone else puts us at the centre of their universe, giving us a control over them that’s even more seductive because we aren’t in any danger of ceding any
  control to them. (Plus, if we are feeling pessimistic because previous partner choices have misfired, such a person may be even more attractive because we believe they are our only remaining
  option.)</p>
<p>Given all this, being pursued can make us blind to danger signals. We may ignore huge signs of incompatibility, consign huge doubts to the file marked ‘ignore’. And, particularly if
  our would-be partner stays the course, we may stay with them despite misgivings; there is something deeply romantic about Being Won Despite All Challenges. ‘She wanted me even though she was
  married. . .’; ‘I wasn’t interested but he was so keen. . .’; ‘I was convinced by her conviction that I was the one for her . . .’ It was Wallis Simpson who
  – feeling bound to marry the abdicated Edward VIII long after she had tired of him – commented: ‘You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance.’</p>
<p>Balance, imbalance</p>
<p>Again, pause and take stock. Do you recognize in yourself a habit of staying in a relationship well beyond the point you should be leaving? Of leaving when you should be giving
  it another chance? Are you consistently drawn to those who don’t pick you? To those who are married – whether to spouse or to job? To those who care, but only at certain times, only in
  certain situations and only when you offer attention, support or no-strings sex?</p>
<p>Or do you find yourself in relationships with partners who do choose you but who you know, heart of hearts, will make you deeply unhappy? Do you find yourself persuaded by intensity (or by
  flattery, or by genuine if one-sided love), to the point of ignoring your own doubts and ending in uneasy partnership? In all these situations, it may be time to change.</p>
<p>All that said, don’t panic if there’s some imbalance in a relationship, particularly at the start. Every relationship suffers disequilibrium. Even for just a few moments, one person
  wonders while the other is certain; one person doubts while the other has faith. So long as the dynamic eventually settles into an equal match, that’s fine. More, if what we experience at the
  start of a promising relationship is a certain deliberation on either side, this may well be good news. The resulting choice, if it comes, is likely to be more considered – and therefore more
  dependable.</p>
<p>Choosing</p>
<p>The first chapter of this book painted partner choice as a journey – and the promise that description offers is that there is a conclusion to the trip. It’s a
  promise that will almost certainly come true. We may have encountered detours or cul-de-sacs along the way, but the vast majority of us will reach our destination. We will let go of alternative
  possibilities and begin to focus more and more surely on one. We will come to a point where we believe that we can love, and that we can be loved in return.</p>
<p>And there we are, decision made. We echo the moving words of poet Edwin Muir: ‘yours, my love, is the right human face’. We know. We have committed. We are set for the happiest of
  endings.</p>
<p>Except, except . . . of course this isn’t the end. Commitment is only the beginning, the first choice. There will be other decisions to come and it’s wise to remember they are out
  there waiting for us.</p>
<p>Moving in together. Getting engaged. Marrying. Having children. Raising those children and then staying together to the end of life. The thing about these later transitions is that by the time
  we make them, we’re in a different place from before. As Somerset Maugham pointed out, we are not the same as we were even a year ago, and ‘nor are those we love’.</p>
<p>Through the course of our relationship, we will likely several times come slap up against what can only be described as the Wall of Life – trials of illness, accident, job change, ageing,
  bereavement. Through these, and with the passing of time, we will learn more about our partner and they will learn more about us. And this may shift the goalposts. Soberingly, the second half of
  the Somerset Maugham quotation reminds us that it is only good fortune if ‘we, changing, continue to love a changed person’.</p>
<p>Whether or not we have such good fortune, much of what this book suggests is always relevant. In the context not of a hoped-for or recent connection but an existing and lengthy commitment, it is
  still useful to specify what we want from our partnership; to reassess the fit with our partner’s values, goals and personality; to face fully whether we can still emotionally respond to each
  other. And sometimes that raises questions. If our partner promised us a rose garden but over the years has delivered only armfuls of brutally stinging nettles, it’s understandable if we dump
  the greenery in the waste bin and head for the door.</p>
<p>Nettles aside, the most important factor in making future partnership decisions – just as for the initial choice to partner with that person – is not whether we are currently
  ecstatic but whether we are currently growing, whether we trust that we will grow in the future, and whether we believe our partner is growing too. If we are in a relationship that pushes us to
  mature, we may not be 100 per cent joyful, 24/7 – ask any caterpillar in the process of becoming a butterfly. Yet if we are still evolving, that will make it worthwhile to keep loyal.</p>
<p>Let me end with a tribute to continuing loyalty. In his novel Love in the Time of Cholera, Gabriel García Márquez describes the experience of the multitude of ordinary
  couples who stay the course even though it proves hard. He pays tribute to the immense courage and willingness of those who have chosen again, beyond the first romantic decision, who have overcome
  the challenges of ‘daily incomprehension’, ‘instantaneous hatred’ and ‘reciprocal nastiness’ that characterize most relationships, and he celebrates that it is
  fully possible to come through and to triumph, to reach the point where partners ‘love each other best’.</p>
<p>That’s the hope. That if both of us keep evolving, keep learning, keep growing, then at some point in the future, we will be able to create a wonderful partnership, to relate to each other
  as never before, to love each other ‘best’. And then we will know for absolute certain that we have made the right choice.</p>
