        <h2>Endings Don’t Have to Be Tragedies</h2>
<p>One of the greatest enemies of successful relationships is the often immensely well-intended inertia that keeps us lingering, and emotionally dying, in unsuccessful ones. But we’ll never get into a good relationship if we can’t or don’t want to get out of a bad one. Why do we, then, so often stay stuck? A range of reasons present themselves.</p>
<p>The first has to do with a frequent refusal to accept that love has died. In order to escape this hugely awkward thought, we tell ourselves a half-truth that can keep couples going for years: we do love the partner, we say, we just want them to change. A lot. In many areas. Seeking change sounds a lot more respectable than no longer loving – and the union can thereby be kept alive at least until the children are fully grown. But if maintaining a relationship involves us having to vow to become a totally different version of ourselves, we might start to wonder. The question that should start to dawn upon us is: Do we actually belong together? It’s a little as if our partner had bought a dog and then condemned it for barking. Shame can get in the way of seeing something obvious: we have outgrown one another.</p>
<p>We also stay for too long because we get immensely skilled at telling ourselves happy stories about the future; we may have acquired the technique during an interminable and sad childhood. We know how to calm our partner down; we are adept at tiptoeing round their moods; we look forward to next year and the year after. We sidestep confrontations; we tell ourselves that, if only we try hard enough, things will get better in a while. We are so good at enduring strife, we end up feeling that this is what a relationship should be like: a state where the good things will always be just over the horizon and where the possibility of warmth and empathy is continually deferred. What we’re struggling to acknowledge is that our faith in what lies ‘over the horizon’ is ultimately a neurosis in our deep minds. Hope can become responsible for the most hopeless situations.</p>
<p>At other times, it is a fear of hurting our partner that prevents us from leaving. We don’t love them any more, but nor can we bear to see them upset, so we might be willing to stay at least until New Year – or maybe even next spring or summer – to avoid a devastating scene. Yet whatever we like to tell ourselves, we are already hurting them a great deal by remaining beside them simply because of the pain it would cause us to see them crying. We are using up some of the best years of their lives because we are not brave enough to endure a few hours of discomfort. This isn’t kindness or consideration; it’s desperate cowardice dressed up as compassion. Of course we don’t want to hurt our partner. But that’s not the issue. Our ultimate responsibility is to the rest of their lives, which we will continue to destroy until we have had the kindness to find our tongue.</p>
<p>If we’ve got children together, the hesitation can come from another direction. Children almost always wish their parents could stay together, but analysed a little more closely, what they really wish is more nuanced. We might conceive of children as essentially deeply practical creatures, comparable in many ways to guests who have decided to spend their holidays in a particular hotel under a certain management, of whom they’ve grown very used and (usually) very fond. What these guests want above all is to secure a set of deeply pragmatic and very understandable goals:</p>
<p>•   They want a minimum of administrative hassle.</p>
<p>•   They want the adults around them to get on cheerfully.</p>
<p>•   They want as little alteration in routine as possible.</p>
<p>•   They don’t want to be made to hang out with new people.</p>
<p>•   They don’t want to meet a half-naked adult stranger at breakfast.</p>
<p>•   They don’t want rumours to circulate about their ‘hotel’ that will make them look weird in front of their peers.</p>
<p>That said, they arguably don’t particularly care about a whole host of other things:</p>
<p>•   how often, or how pleasingly, their parents are having sex</p>
<p>•   whether their parents are the deepest sorts of soulmates</p>
<p>•   what their parents get up to in their spare time</p>
<p>These comparative lists start to suggest a possible answer to the dilemma of whether one might stay or leave insofar as the welfare of children is the issue. The question can be answered either way. Both staying and leaving could be made profoundly compatible with children’s concerns, because the emotional satisfaction of their parents isn’t the central issue for young people. The central issue is how much disruption there might be in their lives. There are ways of staying that will cause massive disruptions: horrific fights between the hotel managers that won’t allow guests to enjoy very much of their time. And there are ways of leaving that also create extreme disruption, or ways that stir up almost no disruption at all … The reason the stay-or-leave question is so tricky – in essence – is that children don’t really care whether you stay or leave; they want an undisturbed life, a pleasant atmosphere and a good mood among the management, which could be compatible or incompatible with either choice. It just depends how it’s done.</p>
<p>For those who might want to leave, one can imagine conceiving of a range of innovations:</p>
<p>•   Perhaps the children wouldn’t move between homes, the parents would.</p>
<p>•   Perhaps the children wouldn’t hang out a lot with new partners, just the parents would.</p>
<p>•   Perhaps the children wouldn’t have to know about the depths of the disappointment between the parents, they’d just notice a sensible and kindly relationship between them.</p>
<p>A concern for more authentic and emotionally alive relationships has been, in many ways, an enormous advance for humanity. But it’s left us very confused as to what the priorities are for children. A non-Romantic worldview provides a clear answer: one doesn’t need to spend the rest of one’s life with someone with whom one no longer connects ‘for the sake of the children’. But at the same time, one must ensure that if one leaves, everything is done to keep the practical basis of a child’s life as stable as possible – as with a hotel that has come under new, divided ownership but bends over backwards to make sure its guests suffer few inconveniences.</p>
<p>Lastly, we don’t leave because, in many societies, the vision of a good relationship is that it should end only in death. It’s a moving but inherently odd notion. In some areas, we can accept that good undertakings are allowed to have endings; we don’t blame a novel for having a final chapter or an opera a closing scene. It would be immensely helpful to import this artistic perspective into our romantic lives. A relationship that finishes needn’t have been a failure; it may (like War and Peace or Così fan tutte) have been completed: it accomplished its task, it arrived at its destiny, it fulfilled its potential. We did together what it was in our power to do.</p>
<p>Relationships should logically conclude when we’ve learnt as much from a partner as we’ll ever be able to; when we’ve absorbed so much through being with them that we’re now ready to take our leave and perhaps – as it were – attend a school with a new teacher. One of the kindest and truest views of relationships is that they are in effect schools for emotional growth – which also implies that we can legitimately graduate from them. We can leave not because we hate our partner but because we’ve completed the course they can offer. There’s a parallel in the way that parents can be pleased that their child leaves home – not because they are glad to see the back of them but because leaving is the sign that things have gone well: the child has been sufficiently loved to be able to separate confidently.</p>
<p>In the ideal future, we’d have a culture that took an educational approach to relationships. It would have high ambitions around what a couple could teach one another and how they could grow through being together. But it would, consequently, see this as – in some cases – a finite task, as something that one could get done in a given span. The ideal duration of some people’s relationship might be a month or five years or three decades. Breaking up wouldn’t have to be a mark of failure; it could be a recognition that the good, essential work of sharing what each person had to offer the other had been completed. A relationship would finish not because it had failed but because it had royally succeeded.</p>
