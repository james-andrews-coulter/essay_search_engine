        <h3>What everybody really wants</h3>
<p>We are often in situations of wanting to help and be kind to others, but of not knowing what they might need. We would like to deepen our connection to them and be of service, yet we lack a real grasp of what we could plausibly offer them. Their minds seem impenetrable; their problems opaque.</p>
<p>At such moments, we would do well to remember that we all possess a superpower – a capacity to give people something we can be sure they require – founded on a primordial and basic insight into human nature: everyone is in deep need of reassurance. Life is a more or less ongoing emergency for everyone. We are invariably haunted by doubts about our value, concerns for our future, shapeless anxiety and dread about things we’ve done, and feelings of guilt and embarrassment about ourselves. Every day brings new threats to our integrity and, except for very rare moments when we and the world feel solid, there is almost always a background throb of unwellness in our minds. It doesn’t matter whether they are old or young, accomplished or starting out, at the top of the tree or struggling to get by, we can count on one thing about anyone we meet: they will be beset by a sense of insecurity and, beneath some excellent camouflage, of desperation. Perhaps even more than they realise, they will be longing for someone to say something soothing to them; a word to make them feel that they have a right to exist; that we have faith in them; that we know things aren’t always easy for them and that – in a vague but real way – we are on their side. It could be a small and barely perceptible remark, but its effect might be critical: that something fascinating they said sticks in our minds; that we know the past few months have not been easy for them; that we’ve found ourselves thinking of them since our last meeting; that we’ve noticed and admire the way they go about things; that they deserve a break and are, we can see, carrying so much.</p>
<p>It is easy to mistake reassurance for flattery. But flattery involves a lie to gain advantage, whereas reassurance involves revealing genuine affection – which we normally leave out from embarrassment – in order to bolster someone’s ability to endure. We flatter in order to extract benefit; we reassure in order to help. Furthermore, the flatterer tells their prey about their strengths, whereas the reassurer does something infinitely more valuable: they hint that they have seen the weaknesses, but have only tolerance and compassion for them on the basis of sharing fully in comparable examples.</p>
<p>‘I think you’re going to be fine’; ‘Everyone goes through things like these’; ‘You have nothing to be ashamed of …’ The words we need to say to reassure aren’t new – they can be the most apparently banal of sentences – but we need to keep hearing them because our minds are bad at holding on to their nourishing truths. They are, furthermore, lines that are much more valuable and inclined to stick if someone else addresses them to us than if we try to rehearse them by ourselves.</p>
<p>In 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio (1401–1428) painted a rendition of Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden on the walls of Florence’s Church of Santa Maria del Carmine. We need not believe in any of the supernatural aspects of Genesis to be profoundly moved by the horror-stricken faces of the banished couple. If we are moved, it is because we see a version of an agony that is essentially universal – for all of us have effectively been cast out of the realm of comfort and plenty and obliged to dwell in the lands of uncertainty, humiliation and grief. All of us are beset by woes; all of us are worried to the core, longing for rest and in urgent need of forbearance and gentleness.</p>
<p>Part of the responsibility of living in a time in which few people still believe in divine reassurance is that each of us can play a part in delivering that reassurance ourselves, to our fellow sufferers, in ordinary moments of our ordinary lives. We do not generally know the details of other people’s travails, but we can often be sure of a few things: that they are at some level in a mood of pain and self-suspicion; that certain very significant things will not have gone right; that there will be loneliness, anxiety and shame at play; and that it could therefore make a big difference if we said something, however modest and unoriginal, to bring a little reassurance into their day.</p>
