            <h1>1. Getting Ready</h1>
<p>‘The obvious is usually profoundly significant.’</p>
<p>(EDWARD O. WILSON)</p>
<p>What does it mean to feel a connection with nature?</p>
<p>It means gaining an insight into the most important network there ever has been and ever will be. It means becoming aware of our relationship with this network. It means expecting a fascinating
  and enriching experience each time we step outside. And it means embarking on a journey that leads towards the realization that every single thing that we have found interesting up to this point in
  our lives has its roots in this network we call nature. Health, business, politics, sport, sex, violence and culture: all subsets of nature.</p>
<p>A connection with nature allows us to see the roots that sustain and explain everything around us. The interest we find in a place is intimately tied to the history of that place and how far
  back we look. Many people focus on what has taken place during the past week, or two hundred years, but we can look back millions of years if we choose to. Politicians may like to warm themselves
  by focusing on the belief that they are arguing in the Houses of Parliament because they are very important representatives of the People. They only see the last pages of the book; if they flicked
  back to earlier chapters they would see that they are just Homo sapiens, a species that needs a lot of water to thrive and migrates towards rivers to form colonies in places like
  Westminster. Big Ben might be thought of as the plumage of that one peculiar species.</p>
<p>In 1943, the American psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed a theory based around a human hierarchy of needs. He suggested that healthy development follows a sequence that
  progresses from the most basic needs, like food and shelter, towards more complex emotional ones, like respect and self-esteem. It is an idea that is mirrored in the steps necessary to form a deep
  connection with nature.</p>
<p>Our ancestors must have subconsciously appreciated that a discussion about self-esteem was a low priority if they were starving and suffering from frostbite. Busy, ‘sophisticated’
  modern humans allow themselves to believe that these earlier, lower stages in the hierarchy are in the past, of little relevance to our lives today. But this is a mistake; if we are looking to make
  a profound connection with our environment we cannot start at the top. Some of the first areas to explore are the practical ways that we can reconnect with nature.</p>
<p>For the majority of us it is possible to experience a deep sense of joy in doing something new. This desire for novelty may no longer be vital in terms of survival,
  but it is essential if we want to think differently. This is because there are some basic actions that can bypass our modern and artificial obstacles to thinking. It does not take a huge change in
  lifestyle to achieve this joy; small actions introduced to a modern routine can have the desired effect. The simple act of using the sun or moon to prevent yourself from becoming disorientated as
  you drive to a new friend’s home, for instance, is a more important experience than many might have guessed.</p>
<p>Sheltering from the wind in a hollow, eating wild berries or curing an ailment with a leaf are no longer necessary physically; we can buy products to overcome these challenges instead. But to
  achieve a connection with nature they are wonderful early steps. Ludicrously simple acts with obvious consequences can offer surprising philosophical rewards. Walking towards the sound of water
  gurgling in a stream when thirsty, instead of thinking about a tap or bottle, can open up new thought patterns. A basic new action can blow away some of the sophistries that get in the way of
  profound insight. This is an idea that has been central for Buddhists for centuries, not least the Zen and Shugendo movements, but which remains important to all of us, regardless of our personal
  religion or philosophy. That is the whole point of doing it.</p>
<p>New actions inevitably lead to new experiences, and this novelty kicks our senses out of the slump induced by routine. This in turn raises our levels of awareness. One of the
  peculiar consequences of starting to notice new things is that we cannot help but notice how little we have been noticing hitherto.</p>
<p>Once we notice something that until now has slipped past us, our minds are likely to develop a voracious appetite for more. We will not be satisfied with a morsel, but find ourselves urging our
  senses on to devour all the things out there that we have overlooked. And unlike so many urges to binge, this desire is healthy. Heightened awareness is one of the few mind-altering
  ‘substances’ which lends itself to excess without redress.</p>
<p>The way to satisfy this craving is to get to know our senses and then work with them, tuning them, giving them a good workout and then unleashing them on new areas. Ask someone, ideally someone
  you trust, to lead you on a blindfolded walk. Then remove the blindfold and attempt to draw the landscape you walked through. The act of using your senses in a new way and drawing, whether or not
  you consider yourself an artist, will lead to a new sensory awareness. If that all sounds like too much effort to start with, then just try walking into an open outdoor space and lying on the
  ground for ten minutes. The required effort-levels don’t get much lower.</p>
<p>Our senses soon reward their new fitness. We start to notice new beauty. Things that once hid behind the great veil of busyness stand out. It is as though a mist has cleared. We see shapes and
  colours that can’t possibly have been around us all along. Can they?</p>
<p>Our senses repay us in so many surprising ways. We become aware of the way things change and react. It is so much easier to connect with someone or something that reacts to you. You’re
  thicker-skinned than most if you do not react at all when somebody comments on your clothing, and amazingly scientists have proved that even plants react to the clothes we wear.</p>
<p>Plants react to colours. For example, if we are dressed in blue we can change the way a plant grows, while if we wear red we will influence its timekeeping. The process by which plants grow
  towards light is called phototropism and is only influenced by blue light. Red light, on the other hand, influences photoperiodism, which governs the plant’s sensitivity to the time of year.
  The changes in a plant that result from our choice of clothing colour may be imperceptible to us, but the knowledge that they are reacting can change the way we think about them.</p>
<p>The Glorious War</p>
<p>As our senses fuel a growing awareness of our surroundings, something strange happens. A new dynamism becomes apparent. This nice wallpaper that we have been calling
  ‘nature’ and ignoring for ages is no longer quite so easy to ignore. Why? Because we find ourselves drawn into the conflict raging all around us.</p>
<p>Conflict is one of the few guaranteed ways of luring us into a subject. We are programmed to find conflict interesting. Movies, soap operas and boxing matches all rely on conflict to keep bums
  on seats. Nature is a box-office winner for those who notice and understand the conflict inherent in it.</p>
<p>Those who are determined to find nature uninteresting are unaware of nature’s hand of cards. Nobody goes into a game of poker with someone who can summon aces at will. Nature’s trump
  card is that we are programmed, by nature, to find conflict fascinating, and nature is conflict. No card sharp can beat that hand. Almost every living thing is permanently engaged in a battle of
  survival. It is the longest-running, highest-budget, most compelling drama that has ever been staged. There are recurrent themes, as there are in all good dramas, but no commercial breaks, no
  repeats and no cheap seats.</p>
<p>Something and Violence</p>
<p>Why do sex and violence get paired and then blamed for impairing the minds of young people via computer and TV screens? Partly because kids gravitate towards these two
  phenomena: they make for irresistible stories. It is not just rubber-necking drivers on roads who find carnage magnetic. Have you ever noticed how kids can’t resist pausing by death? I walked
  in the woods with one of my sons the other day and found him lagging behind. When I retraced my steps to see if he was okay, I found him hypnotized by a dead stoat beside the path. A small
  motionless corpse held his attention in a way that would make Nintendo shareholders salivate.</p>
<p>Violence we know as the final dance of conflict, but sex is equally important to our psyches. Our species is not alone in finding sex of overwhelming interest at times. The instruction manual
  that Darwin found threaded through nature reads something like this:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Find conflict and sex of interest, or die, lonely and then extinct.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Make sure you understand Step 1.</p>
<p>That is not a pretty flower you are looking at. It’s a sex machine, whoring itself to the bees. How can something so pretty be so wanton! The intrigue grows when we
  realize that some vibrant colours attract while others repel.</p>
<p>Poisons have failed in their task if they are ingested; it is too late to deter something that has already eaten you. And so organisms warn predators that trouble is in store with bright colours
  and extreme contrast. Predators soon learn that these combinations make for a poor meal or worse. We learn to make similar associations too. The greater the contrast and the brighter the colours in
  our road signs, the more likely there is danger ahead. Dull brown and a little white: something harmless, like a tourist attraction. Lots of bright yellow and some black: potential hazard, like a
  low bridge.</p>
<p>Some of the most admirable creatures use colour and contrast for both sexual allure and violent repellence. The peacock butterfly is instantly recognizable to mates, but is also able to deter
  predators. One flex of its wings, and ‘eyes’ appear on its back, and the rodent predator sees an arch-enemy owl and scuttles away in a panic.</p>
<p>The Venus flytrap is one of the most famous plants in the world, loved by many, not least kids, and abhorred by a few too. But nobody finds it dull on first meeting. ‘A plant that springs
  a trap shut and murders its victims in an acid bath, you say? Tell me more.’ Well, okay, if you insist. The flytrap part of the name comes, logically, from its habit of trapping
  flies. The Venus part comes from the lewd imagination of eighteenth-century naturalists like John and William Bartram, who thought they saw a likeness of the female genitalia in the form
  of Dionaea muscipula.</p>
<p>Is that bright colour trying to lure something into bed, or warning of a poison that will kill? Butterflies and fungi. Sex and violence.</p>
<p>A Unique Experience</p>
<p>New awareness leads us to notice time in a fresh way. Time is shy and likes to remain concealed for half a lifetime or more. It is no coincidence that those whose time has been
  called, those who battle a terminal illness, are the people who report the most intense awareness of their surroundings and the passing of time. But we need not wait for such a predicament to stop,
  look and listen. An interest in nature is a philosophical pension. The sooner you start investing, the greater and longer the rewards. Did I mention that it doesn’t cost anything?</p>
<p>A path you thought you knew now sounds different underfoot, and is slippery with fallen leaves. The light is different too and a new strong smell of decay engulfs you. Sights, sounds and smells
  mutate with the months. There are the most extraordinary fresh-air calendars to be found on each walk. The Ongee, the indigenous people of the Andaman Islands, use a scent calendar. As each flower
  blossoms and gives its scent to the forest air, that is the smell that comes to define the time of year.</p>
<p>The clock that cannot be bought, the one that mocks those ineffectual coils and springs, is tick-tocking all around. If we return at a later date to a spot we have visited, it will be a very
  different place. The more we notice, the more obvious it becomes that it is impossible to return to the same spot twice. And strange new sensations crowd in around.</p>
<p>If we stay out past sunset, we will notice that certain star constellations hide for much of the year: Orion is a winter constellation, Scorpius a summer one. The night sky holds other regular
  visitors who appear as promised and then disappear for a whole year. If we are sensitive to these changes in the sky, then they come to be closely associated with the seasonal changes on the ground
  and our own habits. The gardening writer Katherine Swift, for example, likes to welcome the Perseid meteor shower after jam-making in August.</p>
<p>More excitingly, and alarmingly, it is impossible even to return to the same place within a single day. The daily changes that shape each place are dramatic, but take greater levels of awareness
  to unlock and so go unnoticed by almost everyone. As the flowers react to the angle of light and the sun makes its way across the sky, whole fields change colour. When my neighbour has sown
  linseed, the field I know best turns from a moody mauve in the morning to an ebullient purple at lunchtime. Each and every day, birdsong is marking out a soundscape that shifts west as the earth
  turns and we find ourselves standing on a music box that needs no winding.</p>
<p>The world around us is morphing; it is a shape-shifter. Colours, smells and sounds swirl through daily and annual patterns, putting on displays then disappearing with promises to return in new
  clothes. There is the regularity of a solar drum behind all the changes, but this regularity passes through the individual kaleidoscope that is our locality. Time makes both sense and a delightful
  madness of each place and moment. The only certainty is that you will only get one opportunity to experience each scene exactly the way it is. It will be different if you return in ten months or
  ten minutes.</p>
<p>Time is not content to limit its power to conducting the changes in the landscape all around us, and one of its delicious tricks is to slip in through our ears and sculpt our thoughts and
  senses. We all have individual chronotypes, which is just a scientific way of saying that we are subject to our own daily ups and downs. Some have energy in the mornings, the larks, some in the
  evenings, the owls, and many of us like to throw coffee, chocolate and stronger things at these tides in an effort to manipulate them. Our experience of the world is deeply subjective.</p>
<p>Each day our sleep patterns, blood-sugar levels and hormones dramatically repaint the scenes we see. Psychologists are building a better and more bizarre understanding of the world as we see it.
  In a lecture I gave at the Royal Geographical Society, I showed the audience a photograph of a pile of bananas and asked them to quickly shout out the colour they first saw. ‘Yellow!’
  they cried at first. Then, ‘No, White.’ The photo was black and white. The world is not always as it seems and time, like shapes, can trick us.</p>
<p>The Banana Skin and the Great Network</p>
<p>As we set out to build a stronger connection, we need to beware an early trap. It is very hard to find nature interesting if you are bundling all of it into one lot. This is
  the biggest risk early on.</p>
<p>Nature is not one big pile. Plants set some people on fire and douse the enthusiasms of others. Some dedicate much of their life to the study of an individual insect species while others recoil
  at any creepy-crawly they see. The pioneering American planter of apple trees, John Chapman, felt it wrong to ride a horse or chop down a tree. He was so cross when he accidentally stepped on a
  worm that he punished his own foot by throwing away its shoe. Nature is diverse. People are diverse. Each to their own. And footwear is optional.</p>
<p>It is not just feathers and leaves and those millions of living organisms that stimulate intrigue and obsession. The eminent metallurgist Cyril Smith was colour-blind. He formed his own
  fascination and bond with nature by learning to appreciate the intricate patterns in metal alloys. Smith became sensitive to the ‘swirls, filigree, and banding’ that each metal offered
  his senses. The biologist Edward O. Wilson has gone so far as to claim that the love of machines is but a specialist form of nature-loving. Jeremy Clarkson is therefore a naturalist. He has been
  called many things, but a naturalist? Well, let’s try petrol-head instead. Petrol is refined oil, which is derived from decomposed zooplankton and algae. Clarkson may not be a naturalist in
  the common understanding of the word, but he is a zooplankton-head.</p>
<p>In time we come to appreciate that the tiny part of nature’s spectrum that lures us in at first – perhaps the birds, the orchids, the colour of sand; who knows, except you? –
  is intimately connected to one or two other parts. We come to know those other parts by association. A best friend’s friend becomes a friend, enemy or lover with time.</p>
<p>Whatever first draws you in, there will come a moment when it becomes clear that its close connections in turn have their own connections. This is the exhilarating moment when we realize that
  everything is connected. It is something that we need to experience ourselves; merely being told about nature’s interconnectedness, here or anywhere else, can prompt you to look for it, but
  it cannot recreate the effect of experiencing it. For all who take the time to find it, there comes a giddy second when the pieces suddenly fly together in a dizzying vortex of geology, biology,
  ecology and many other words ending in ‘ology’. But, thankfully, this experience takes place without the words themselves attached. Our attempts to label things don’t make the
  beauty or our experience of it. They can help or hinder us in our attempts to find it, but they form the map, not the territory, and are far from the extraordinary experiences to be found within
  it.</p>
<p>Our senses might reveal an animal, which can tell us something about the plants with which it shares its habitat, which in turn reveal something about the rocks, soil and climate. All around,
  the scents, colours and sounds are marking the moment precisely, while our experience is shaped by what we had for breakfast and what we got up to the night before. A furry creature becomes a key
  to unlocking everything around you and inside you.</p>
<p>We emerged from a habitat and we will return to a habitat, as mulch of some kind. Our experience in the short time between these two moments will be in some part determined by the interest we
  take in our habitat. It is hard to lead a poorer life by noticing more.</p>
<p>We are where we are because we have been drawn here by a conspiracy. It is a grand and wonderful conspiracy, one that snares every plant, animal and human being. It is so much more fun being
  snared voluntarily by a system we understand and enjoy than by one that baffles us.</p>
<p>In the following chapters we will step from looking at the broad connections that are easy for all to spot, towards some of the more extraordinary ones. The aim is to reach the point where the
  networks that these connections form touch the world that fascinates you. I have no idea exactly where that will be, but I am certain that if you have a heart pumping blood to your nervous system,
  it can be found.</p>
