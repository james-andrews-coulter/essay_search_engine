            <h2>Agnes Martin &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>If there were to be a patron artist of melancholy, it might be the American abstract painter Agnes Martin. Over a long life (1912–2004), she produced hundreds of canvases, most of them 1.8 by 1.8 metres, showing not very much at all. From a distance, they can seem merely white or grey, though step nearer and you notice grid patterns hand drawn in pencil, beneath which run horizontal bands of colour, often a particularly subtle shade of grey, green, blue or pink. There is an invitation to slough off the normal superficiality of life and bathe in the void of emptiness; the effect is soothing and moving too. For reasons to be explored, we might want to start crying.</p>
<p>The works may appear simple, but their effects are anything but. ‘Simplicity is never simple,’ explained Martin, having studied Zen Buddhism for many years and learnt that encounters with little can be frightening, because they remind us of our own ultimate nothingness, which we otherwise escape through noise and frantic and purposeless activity. ‘Simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve, from the standpoint of the East. I’m not sure the West even understands simplicity.’</p>
<p>In the little town of Taos, in the north central region of New Mexico, where Martin spent her last years, one can visit the Agnes Martin Chapel, an octagonal room, empty except for seven of her paintings and four steel cubes by her friend and fellow minimalist artist Donald Judd. Here we can sense how far we generally drift from what is important, how often we lose ourselves in meaningless chatter. The paintings bid us to throw aside our customary, relentless self-promotion. It is just us and the sound of our own heartbeat, the light coming in from an oculus above (across which a New Mexico cloud occasionally drifts), the patient work of thousands of hand-drawn grids repetitively punctuated by strips of the mildest hues of grey and pink – and the peace there would have been over the oceans when the Earth was first created.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t suppose that Agnes Martin was herself anything like the peaceful canvases she turned out. When still a young woman, she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffered from repeated bouts of extreme depression. She would often hear voices in her head criticising her and urging her to take her own life. It could be hell inside her mind. But it is then all the more understandable that she might, as an artist, have felt compelled to produce some of the most serene works the world has ever known, and that she gained boundless relief from spending hours – decades in total – alone in a simple house on the edge of the New Mexico desert, listening to Bach and Beethoven, tracing grids on canvases and applying paint in colours that Zen Buddhism identifies with the renunciation of the ego and the alignment of the self with cosmic harmony.</p>

<p>If we are moved, it’s not because our lives are themselves extremely serene. It’s because, like the artist herself, we have for far too long been familiar with excessive noise. The canvases are like maps to a quiet destination we have lost sight of. We might point to them and say that this is where we actually, really belong. The paintings are how we could be if we sat with our own feelings a little longer, if we gave up using our clever minds to ward off sadness, if we made our peace with mystery.</p>
<p>Nowadays, by the typically perverse accidents of the art market, Agnes Martin’s paintings cost as much as aeroplanes. Generally, they can only be seen in bustling public museums. In a better world, we’d all be able to have a few of our own. As it is, we can at least spend time with them in high-quality online versions and printed reproductions. They are sad pictures, in the best of ways. They know of our troubles; they understand how much we long for tenderness yet how rough everything has been day to day; they want us to have the simplicity of little children and the hearts of old, wise people who have stopped protesting and started to welcome experience. The titles that Martin gave her paintings indicate some of what she was getting at: Loving Love, Gratitude, Friendship and – best of all – I Love the Whole World, which implies the sort of love we experience not when everything has been hunky-dory, but when we have, after the longest time, come through from the other side of agony.</p>
