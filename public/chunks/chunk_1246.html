        <h2>Places of Appreciation</h2>
<p>We’re often under the impression that there is something inevitable and automatic about the way we decide that certain places are beautiful and worth visiting. It seems — for example — simply normal to want to go and look at Amsterdam or New York, the fields of Provence or the coast of Normandy, the lonely motels of America or the cafés of Paris.</p>
<p>Yet this is to overlook the extent to which our sense of what is beautiful has been actively moulded for us over time by artists whose work has guided our eyes — and made it possible for us to perceive a charm or interest in places that we might have walked straight past had we not been inducted with grace and expertise into their virtues. It may seem as if artists simply show us reality, but there is no such thing as reality per se, only an infinite number of possible realities from which a great artist will make a careful selection in order to tease out a vision that possesses particular interest and profundity. They will choose only certain times of day. They will discard all but a few kinds of light, they will crop their images to throw our attention on a very specific spot — and as a result of their labours, a beauty that might otherwise have remained latent, and fatefully mixed in with all that is humdrum and dispiriting, forgettable and offensive, is extracted like a precious metal from its ore, released, flourishes and then becomes impossible for us not to see.</p>
<p>We may think that we have chosen our itineraries, but it is, in truth, Van Gogh who has helped to give us the wish to go and see Provence, Vermeer and de Hooch who have incited in us a wish to visit the Netherlands, Monet who has taught us to appreciate the Normandy coast, Edward Hopper and Robert Frank who made us want to travel the lonely roads of rural America, and Caillebotte and Pissarro who gave us instruction on how to love the streets of Paris.</p>
<p>What makes Jim Dow’s image of a diner in Watertown, Massachusetts particularly apt is that it is both a place that we would very likely have dismissed as utterly banal, and yet also one which, under Dow’s quiet tutorship, we can come to recognise as distinctly dignified and seductive. The charm was always there. Dow (like other good artists) didn’t make it up — he isn’t an advertiser — but he had to identify it and throw it into relief. Our eyes had to be led to notice the solemnity of those coffee and tea dispensers and the general modest refinement of this chrome-plated machine for catering.</p>
<p>The pity is that there remain so many parts of the world that are beautiful and interesting, but that lack the artists who could help us appreciate them. We may have seen a lot already, but there is still so much more to notice.</p>
<p>It’s a hugely fanciful but importantly instructive picture. The young woman on the right is Germania; she’s got fair skin and light-coloured hair and behind her is a Gothic cathedral and a castle typical of her country. Next to her on the left is Italia, a dark-haired maiden with a Tuscan-style village church visible beyond her shoulder. Judging by the way they are holding hands and sitting intensely next to one another, the two women have also fallen deeply in love — though, because it was 1828, the distinguished painter Friedrich Overbeck couldn’t put it exactly like that to his audience. They were just very good friends.</p>
<p>The picture brings to the fore, in a way that later, more sophisticated works might not, a basic truth about our relationship to other lands: we are sometimes drawn to them in the way that we might be to a person. Crucially, the way we choose the country to venerate is similar to the way we may identify a partner. We frequently look to fall in love with people who will, in some way, be able to ‘complete’ us: that is, make up for a gap in our personalities and render us whole through their complementary skills and traits. If we are shy, it may be their confidence and bravery that entice us; if we are somewhat chaotic, their order and precision may prove the locus of our desire.</p>
<p>The same search for completion may be present in our attraction to countries. A Brazilian may find themselves filling a void in their personality by spending time in Norway; the streets of Tromsø may bring them a peace and diffidence that those in Campos dos Goytacazes do not. A Swiss national from Appenzell might connect with missing parts of themselves in Peru’s Paucar del Sara Sara. And, for centuries, as Friedrich Overbeck made clear, many Germans have felt that Italy contained elusive (or under-represented) parts of their own natures, with which they wanted to become familiar.</p>
<p>In asking someone what country they feel ready to love, we are learning — first and foremost — about what elements of personality they value, but don’t securely possess, and therefore need to bolster. Some of what we are seeking through our journeys is to mature and correct our imbalances: like Italia and Germania, we are looking to become whole by uniting with a foreign land.</p>
