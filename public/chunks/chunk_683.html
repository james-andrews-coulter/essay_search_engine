        <h2>15. BUT I DON’T FIND THEM AWFUL!</h2>
<p>One of the reasons we may be confused as to whether to stay or leave is that we don’t find our partner especially awful. Remarkably, we don’t hate them. Strangely, we don’t mind spending time with them. Oddly, we still admire them in a host of ways.</p>
<p>The confusion caused by this duality – by an ongoing respect and tenderness together with a hunch that we should still be off soon – throws up one of the odder, though very prevalent, ideas that circulate in our minds: that the only legitimate moment to leave a person is when we can’t bear them any longer; that the primary justification for departure is hatred and a sick feeling in the pit of our stomach; that the reason to quit is loathing.</p>
<p>This idea is unhelpful and cruel for both parties. When we are being left, that story fits into the darkest narrative we may have about ourselves and our value. Of course we are a target of hatred; of course someone has found us despicable. All the sweet words that might have accompanied a break-up must mean nothing. There can only be one reason for the split: the leaver is disgusted with us, has seen something appalling in our soul, considers us vermin, and can’t bear our presence. But the story is no less grim for the leaver. It makes what they are doing appear especially cold-hearted. Only a very angry or indifferent person would put a partner through such an event. It raises the stakes of a break-up hugely on both sides.</p>
<p>But, as we have seen, there are a host of far less awful reasons why kind and good people break up: because we need freedom to develop our characters; because we have learnt enough; because we sense that we are stifling someone we love or are not aligned on some central priorities. It is entirely possible both to quit and to love.</p>
<p>Someone can be wrong now but have been right in all sorts of ways for a very long time. That we still have feelings for our partner is not a sign that we must stay with them; nor is the fact that we are leaving evidence that we must hate them. Tenderness is no unwarranted feeling in a departing partner. If forced, we could happily stay with them for the rest of our lives. But we are not forced, and we are not obliged. Our ultimate responsibility is to our growth and flourishing. We should not be puzzled that we find our partner lovely. We can admire our younger selves for having chosen so wisely, but simultaneously honour who we are today and who we need to be tomorrow.</p>
