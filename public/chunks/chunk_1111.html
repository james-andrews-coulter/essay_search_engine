        <h2>The Fuchun Mountains</h2>
<p>The Fuchun Mountains belong to a modest range most peaks rise to only 1,000 metres that runs southwest of Hangzhou, along the northern bank of the Fuchun River in southern China. They are exceptionally beautiful peaks, dotted with pine trees and alpine grasslands, often coated in mist in the early mornings and largely deserted.
Though China has been an unusually urban society since the 10th century, in its art, it has looked constantly to the countryside. In its most favoured landscape scrolls, one theme has been recurrent: the idea of a small wooden hut set somewhere beneath some trees in a highly remote location with a view onto mountains. In one of the most famous of these works, by the 14th-century artist Huang Gongwang, ink and brush strokes conjure up a beguiling world suggestive of harmony with nature and peace with ourselves.
Yuan and Ming Dynasty China were not societies in which inner calm was ever particularly easy to claim. There was a huge expansion in trade but wealth was unequally distributed, the court in Beijing was filled with intrigue, careers could be quickly made but as rapidly undone, rumours could destroy reputations forever and there was ceaseless manoeuvring for favours and advancement. However high an individual might have risen, it was impossible to be sure that they would not lose it all at any moment.
In the circumstances, many of the most ambitious members of society developed a veneration for surrendering all worldly goals when the time called for it and taking to a hut in the mountains. There, a person might spend the rest of their life painting, studying Buddhism, writing poetry and eating and dressing with utter simplicity. There was a respect for what were called yinshi (hidden men), yimin (disengaged people) or chushi (scholars at home), honourable terms for those who had dropped out of the competitive race in the name of freedom from anxiety and fulfilment of the soul.
It was no coincidence that these Chinese recluses went to the mountains. Most people resided on the plains and in the cities, so mountain land was cheap to buy; it was possible to survive on a fraction of what life in Nanjing or Ningbo would cost. More importantly, mountains directed the mind appropriately. Through their height, their isolation, their untouched dignity, they symbolised the virtues of an independent life, no longer in hock to political factions and the whims of urban opinion. It didn’t matter so much what the Emperor’s favourites were doing when the day could be spent contemplating the dissolution of the ego in a Buddhist text, going out to pick some mushrooms and berries for dinner and looking at the sun setting behind a pine forest.</p>
