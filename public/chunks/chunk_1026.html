        <h2>XVIII: THE LOST ITEM ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>We must have put the keys on the ledge in the hall; we had to have done or how else would we have got in? And now they are missing. We have only minutes to find them or the day and possibly the week will be ruined. How could they have vanished in sly silence? Someone has maliciously moved them. They – the partner with whose life ours is intricately entwined – must have done so, without telling us, carelessly, with an utter disregard for our welfare.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time. There was the missing pullover, the elusive file, the lost nail clippers … The panic and anger that seizes us at such moments is beyond anything we can accept about ourselves when we are serene once more. We are stamping our feet. We are rasping incoherently. There is a plot against us. The missing item fundamentally mocks our claims to mastery; it turns the world into an absurdity. Everything ordered and predictable is undermined. We feel so certain and yet our certainty doesn’t alter the absence one iota. Someone is mocking us. We know where we put the damn keys and yet the keys are still not there, even though they must be there, and yet they are not, and yet they must be, and yet they are not – and we look again and scream and look once more and still they are not there. We get on the phone to the partner at work and start to rant. It is as if malevolent goblins were following us around, deliberately making items vanish and slipping them into unusual pockets and folds in the universe.</p>
<p>‘Where are they? Why did you move them? What are you trying to do to me?’ It’s madness, but it’s also a tribute to the enormous role our lover plays in our lives that we do, at some level, hold them responsible for everything that happens to us, for good or ill. They took the keys; they hid the pullover; they know where the credit card must have gone. Our fury is a symptom of the continuation, deep into adult life, of the early fantasy of the child that their parents control the world and are capable of everything. It’s they who make breakfast appear, who turn out the lights, who choreograph a holiday, who can make Bunny appear when he goes missing and who know how to find the lid to the favourite fat orange pen.</p>
<p>In blaming the lover, we’re protecting a cherished belief: that they can fundamentally always change our fortunes, that they can make objects disappear and then reappear again at will, that they have supernatural powers, that they are in charge, that we are in love with someone who can pull the large levers of existence, that we’re not helpless victims of fate.</p>
<p>It always feels strange when evidence subsequently emerges that it was really nothing of the sort. It is bewildering when later – maybe eight months later, our rage long spent – we stumble upon the missing item where we left it, in the pocket of the old coat or in a drawer in the kitchen between the aluminium roll and the elastic bands.</p>
<p>From the other side of the equation, we will know that someone else loves us when we start to encounter blame and rage not just for the things we have done, but for a much larger, more significant and almost flattering category: everything that saddens and frightens the one we love.</p>
