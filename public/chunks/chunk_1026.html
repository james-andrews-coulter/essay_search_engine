</ol>
<p>When Howard and Gisele Miller, both in their seventies, emerged from the Washington, DC subway they hit a problem. There was no way that they could walk to their daughter and son-in-law’s house for dinner in the snowstorm that was then raging. They needed a cab, but no cabs were stopping in the rush hour. They tried calling the house – this was before the advent of the mobile – but no one was home yet. As their fingers started to go numb Howard noticed a pizza restaurant across the street. He and Giselle went in and ordered a large pizza for home delivery. When the sales assistant asked for the delivery address, Howard gave it and added, ‘Oh, there’s one more thing.’ ‘What’s that?’ asked the assistant. ‘We want you to deliver us with it.’ And so they arrived, along with a giant pizza, for dinner that night.</p>
<p>The Millers’ solution exhibited a resourcefulness that would be admirable at any age, but their son-in-law, Gene Cohen, an American gerontologist, tells the story to illustrate the kind of agile creativity that the ageing mind is capable of. It’s the total opposite of the calcified thinking usually attributed to older people. For the narrative of decline would have us believe that, upon receipt of the state pension – if not considerably earlier – our vital juices desiccate and our life force atrophies: we’re spent. Time, it suggests, is a thief: the night before our sixtieth birthday it creeps in and cleans out our mind and heart, replacing them with an infusion of Old Age. The third-agers, understandably, find such an attitude so unbearable that they simply reverse it: nothing changes with age – it’s just a number.</p>
<p>Loss and gain</p>
<p>A false opposition like this denies the fact that our lives, from their very beginning, are a constant interplay between continuity and transformation. As Molly Andrews put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the life cycle, change and continuity weave an intricate web. As we meet the new challenges, both physical and psychological, with which our lives confront us, so then we are changed, even as we remain the same. Old age is no different from the other stages of life in this regard. The changes are many and real; to deny them, as some do in an attempt to counter ageism, is folly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the greatest challenges of ageing, perhaps, is to recognize what endures and what changes. To those who neither deny ageing, nor close down upon life prematurely, this happens instinctively. If ageing is embraced, then we inevitably recognize that some things are no longer possible and we mourn them. So, for example, an older woman might find her creeping invisibility hard to bear, especially if she’s invested a lot in her appearance.</p>
<p>On the other hand she may actually find it a relief: now she’s freer to do what she wants without anxieties about her appearance or the need for approval getting in the way. (Of course there’s a third possibility: she may never stop delighting in dressing and decorating herself, for her own pleasure and self-expression, no matter the date on her birth certificate.)</p>
<p>Although it might seem paradoxical, mourning is an essential part of ageing with gusto, because it helps you say goodbye to some features of life, freeing you to welcome in new ones. But this isn’t a process confined to old age. A child may articulate it through tears rather than words, but when they start school they may mourn the loss of the unstructured time they’ve enjoyed up till then. Similarly, finishing school is generally celebrated as a wonderful liberation, making it shameful to admit to some sadness about the losses that accompany it: no more ready-made structure, or the (sometimes) consoling presence of parents. We may rebel against school and parents, but not having them there to rebel against is another matter altogether. Being able to tolerate some sadness and grief about necessary losses is a vital human resource to help us age – at any age.</p>
<p>Still me, after all these years</p>
<p>Unless we suffer from totally debilitating Alzheimer’s (the magnet of all our anxieties about ageing these days), time doesn’t steal a person’s essence. We never become Them, but remain ourselves, only older. The journalist Peregrine Worsthorne admitted that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is difficult for me to write about old age because I do not feel old. I simply feel myself. Perhaps I am abnormally, monstrously egocentric in this respect, since I also have to admit that I cannot remember ever having felt young or middle-aged. I can remember the kind of hopes, worries and fears I felt at different periods of my life, but it was the same me having those old worries, hopes and fears. And it is the unbroken continuity of my self-consciousness that makes the circumstantial changes seem relatively insignificant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would it be like to ‘feel old’? Nobody seems to have ever defined it; it’s more often used in the negative – ‘I don’t feel old’ – than in the positive. When people say they feel old they emit a vague sense of weariness, which is often actually depression and not an intrinsic part of ageing at all. Or they’re referring to the way they’re treated by others, like employers. And when they say that they don’t feel old, they’re referring to the stereotypes of age that they themselves may have held. The Guardian newspaper ran a feature in 2013 in which it asked various of its writers how old they felt. Of the six they canvassed, only one admitted to feeling their age; most of the others felt younger. But when a 70-year-old says that she feels 18, does this mean she feels like she did at 18, or how she thinks 18 feels? What does 18 feel like? And how does she imagine 70 feels?</p>
<p>The French writer André Gide, when he was 60, wrote that ‘I have to make a great effort to convince myself that I am at present as old as those who seemed to me so ancient when I was young.’ It’s understandable, of course, that to a young person 60 seems old, but then so does 30. Or 21. Or even, when you are 4 years old, 5. Which of us hasn’t known – or been – the 3-year-old who thinks that life will be utterly transformed on the morning of their fourth birthday? We’ve learnt to assume that age will bring radical discontinuities to our lives, whether at 4 or 40. But it doesn’t. Perhaps this is one of the truths about ageing that we find hardest to learn.</p>
<p>Most older people recognize in themselves the interplay between continuity and change identified by Andrews. Lucy, 63, says, ‘If my younger self were to see me today, she’d recognize me – there’s so much we have in common. At the same time she’d feel enormous relief to see how much happier I’ve become – I often wish I could tell her.’</p>
<p>Stella, 70, has been married to 76-year-old Paul for 40 years. ‘When our children ask us how we can bear being with the same person for so long we say we haven’t – we’ve both changed so much. But Paul still has the same ‘Paulishness’, his mischievous sparkle, that he had when I first met him. There’s an old school photo of him at 13 and he had it then too.’ In this respect we never need to lose our earlier selves, only add to them. These kinds of positive ideas about ageing aren’t the preserve of older people: they can be developed at any stage of life. Similarly embracing age doesn’t mean embracing old age, but accepting the very process of change that occurs as we move through life – it’s as relevant when you move from 28 to 29 as when you pass from 58 to 59.</p>
<p>Still vital, after all these years</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest calumny committed against old people – and the one that most frightens the not-yet-old – is the belief that ageing causes us to leech vitality. Let’s not get too Pollyanna about this: most people find their energy levels changing as they age and have to learn to pace themselves (that’s what siestas were invented for). Even 30-year-olds can be heard complaining that their stamina is receding along with their hairline, while all-night benders begin to exact increasingly large servings of revenge, usually in one’s mid-twenties. But physical and mental vitality, though they may be related, especially if you’re fighting pain, are not the same thing. The idea that one’s appetite for life automatically abates with the passing of the years is simply wrong.</p>
<p>Cicero clocked this. People, said the Roman orator in De Senectute, his treatise on old age, ‘who have no resources in themselves for securing a good and happy life find every age burdensome.’ Only fools, he believed, imputed their own frailties to old age. Although some say he idealized old age, and his own was nothing like the one he wrote about, nevertheless he no more missed the bodily strength he had as a young man, he declared, than he missed the strength of a bull or elephant: ‘The great affairs of life are not performed by physical strength, or activity, or nimbleness of body, but by deliberation, character, expression of opinion. Of these old age is not only not deprived but, as a rule, has them in a greater degree.’</p>
<p>One can be alive or dead at any age. In Hal Ashby’s glorious 1971 black comedy, Harold and Maude, a lugubrious, depressed 19-year-old boy falls in love with a 79-year-old effervescent woman he meets at the funerals they frequent as a hobby. Infusing him with her vitality, she brings him to life.</p>
