        <h2>Tenochtitlan</h2>
<p>customary attitude of anyone approaching e cient culture in the modern age is immense
coat We’re looking to be impressed, to learn ee put our prejudices and assumptions ae This is the mentality with which we are fikely to start a tour of tre National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, one-time Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec peoples. Soon after we begin, we will be confronted by a large jaguar-shaped stone vessel elegantly carved which, a caption will inform us, used to hold the hearts of victims who were being sacrificed to the sun god Huitzilopochtli a few metres from where we’re now standing.
The Aztecs proposed that there had once been many gods in the world and that they had squabbled in a way that made things difficult for humanity. The young god Huitzilopochtli defeated his treacherous siblings and became the furious, but life-giving, sun, separating day from night and making crops grow. The problem was that he needed to be kept going by a constant supply of human hearts, or else his rays would fade and everyone would die. So pyramids were built in all Aztec cities, at the top of which priests would every day cut open the torsos of a dozen or so victims with a flint knife and take their hearts out and hold them up beseechingly to Huitzilopochtli. The bodies were thrown down the steps to be eaten by animals.
Unfortunately, Huitzilopochtli wasn’t the only god who needed to be encouraged. There “as also one called Tlaloc (a caption by a small bath-like container informs us). He was the es of rain, water and fertility, and he needed ST too, though in his case, he children, Something very special: ae tears of ae Under 10, as well as their hearts. So parents (who have to buy children off poorer this bik who couldn’t say no), make them cry ae Wouldn’t have been hard), collect their © bath and then kill them too or else Th anan the rains would fail and all the crops would die. This is no one-off, E i aver thedi a. very society that has that when we look at them dispassionately Cnee repulsive or insane or both., § no reason why our own age should be any exception. It may be easier to see ine lunacies of othertimes, and we can tell rather quickly what is eccentric in a foreign culture, but that doesn’t mean that our own societies are spared their fair share of absurdities.
The Aztecs certainly never thought that they held any sort of curious ideas (they were just doing what they needed to do to keep the sun and the rain in order) and nor, for that matter, did the Thracians, the Carthaginians, the Mongols or the Americans of the 1950s.
This should give us hope. Many of us feel, in the privacy of our minds, that some of the most sacred and popular beliefs of our own times (about what is right and wrong, about who should be revered and what cannot be mentioned) make no sense at all. But we don’t dare to say so or we would be (metaphorically) killed, just like an impudent inhabitant of Tenochtitlan who had cast doubt on the cult of Huitzilopochtli. Yet the fear doesn’t mean we shouldn’t continue with our scepticism. A journey into the past can strengthen us, through a reminder that we are almost guaranteed to be living among ideas which will rightly mortify later ages. It might take 400 years, but the strangeness will eventually become self-evident.
In the meantime, we may have to keep very quiet, but we don’t have to stop doubting.</p>
