        <h2>6.  Contemplative Concentration</h2>
<p>There are forms of leisure which belong somewhere between recreation and non-programmatic contemplation – or rather, which combine both. Many contemplative activities take place in natural settings, and involve a concentrated attentiveness to the natural world. Following the slow shift from light to dark as the sun sets slowly behind the horizon is a simple form of such contemplation, attuning us to a sense of the world’s beauty and its poignant passing. There are also more formal kinds of natural contemplation: bird-watching is one such pastime, which requires both a training of perception and an exact knowledge of the objects observed. It also requires a patient concentration on creatures the watcher appreciates, and even loves. And it can lead (so I understand from writers’ paeans, and bird-watching devotees) to a full absorption in what one is observing, and a temporary forgetfulness of oneself – or at least, of the immediate thoughts and worries that usually occupy our minds.</p>
<p>But among all natural activities, it is fishing – when it is done for its own sake, rather than as a way of making a living – which seems to have inspired the greatest number of devotees and of lyrical tributes. I should quickly aver that the closest contact I’ve had with this activity has been to watch people standing patiently on a riverbank with their extended rods plunged into the water – seemingly perfectly contented, and perfectly absorbed in the act of pure waiting; but the literature such absorption has given rise to testifies to this seemingly quietistic activity’s perception-transforming powers.</p>
<p>The poet Ted Hughes spent many daytime and night-time hours standing still in rivers, observing their flow and the movements of life under the surface as he was trying to lure fish to his bait – and he wrote some powerfully meditative poetry capturing such moments (and his observations of nature altogether). Here, however, he describes in straightforward prose the states this patient, focused stillness can induce: ‘Fishing provides that connection with the whole living world. It gives you the opportunity of being totally immersed, turning back into yourself in a good way. A form of meditation, some form of communion with levels of yourself that are deeper than the ordinary self.’</p>
<p>The contemplative appeal of fishing undoubtedly has to do with the watery element in which it takes place. Water is the great metaphoric element, its flow reminding us both of the ceaseless movement of time, and of nature’s seemingly endless powers of renewal (although we now know that these too can be exhausted). Rivers in various cultures are mythical and holy, and watching the sea in its hypnotic ebb and flow is something that humans have surely done ever since there has been human consciousness. It is an experience which has always induced both awe and a heightened awareness of our existential situation: the impossibility of holding on to any one moment (‘You can’t step in the same river twice’ was Heraclitus’ perpetually relevant summary of this condition); our smallness in relation to nature and the cosmos, and the inevitability of death. In other words, contemplation of this primal element and force takes us temporarily beyond the limits of our individual personalities. It can induce those states in which the boundaries between ourselves and the world briefly dissolve – in which we simultaneously lose our self-consciousness and, paradoxically, feel the coherence and wholeness of all our faculties. It is no wonder that experiences which involve the loss of boundaries and a sense of melding with something outside ourselves (another person, music, nature) are sometimes referred to (by Freud, among others) as ‘the oceanic feeling’.</p>
<p>Contemplating the ocean puts us in touch with our finitude.</p>
<p>Like aesthetic appreciation, these experiences of concentrated immersion in nature are non-instrumental and unprofitable. (Of course, nature pastimes may carry the extra benefit of exercise; though if they are undertaken for the sake of toning one’s muscles, then the contemplative spirit is lost.) But spending some time in proximity to nature is not only pleasurable but beneficial to our physical and mental health. It has been shown, for example, that people in big cities suffer less anxiety if they can spend some time each day in green space.</p>
<p>We need contact with nature for our well-being, possibly because we are attuned to the natural world and its underlying structures through the structures of our nerves and genes. We are drawn to living forms, in what has been called biophilia. If nature seems to us compelling and beautiful – if we are drawn to it with a kind of yearning – that may be because we are in some way made of the same kinds of materials. At the same time, we are not purely natural – we are human, and we live with our particular characters, inner lives and problems. If we spend too much time merging with nature (or with anything else, for that matter, like hallucinogenic drugs) we may take leave of our senses, and our individuality, for good.</p>
<p>But clearing a space for intervals of contemplative observation and concentration can help us still the mental noise and tensions of our daily lives, and restore a sense of perspective and distance from our immediate anxieties and preoccupations. Such moments can replenish our perceptions and our sense of wonder, and help us return to our daily lives feeling calmer and more vividly alive.</p>
