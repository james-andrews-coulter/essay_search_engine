        <h2>Vow three:</h2>
<p>I admit that if there are children they will often claim our attention at the least convenient moments. Our love for them will quite possibly inhibit us sexually; we’ll feel shy unleashing our stranger, more exciting desires, knowing how sweet and innocent they are. I promise to try to accept that if we have a child it will change our sex life, probably for the worse, and I won’t blame you.</p>
