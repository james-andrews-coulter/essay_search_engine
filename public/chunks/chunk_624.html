        <h3>¶ Love as Education</h3>
<p>At the heart of the Romantic vision of love is an idea of complete mutual acceptance. To seek to change one’s lover feels like a profound offence against the whole idea of love.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about and experiencing love can feel entirely natural, but it is a relatively recent historical invention. It stands in sharp contrast to a much older and in certain ways wiser view: the Classical idea that love is an arena of growth and change. This view of love was developed in Ancient Greece, prompted particularly by the philosophical ideas of Socrates and Plato. As they saw it, the task of love is first and foremost to educate one’s lover. We don’t love someone because we think they are perfect already, but because we can see what they could be; we love their potential and their emergent (but not yet fully developed) qualities. Their deep attachment to us means that we have an ideal opportunity for guiding and shaping their development towards the articulation of their full potential. Love is a mutually supportive structure in which two people can guide one another to their respective virtuous ideal selves.</p>
<p>This pedagogical view of love now sounds extremely odd. We don’t imagine love as a classroom. Our current culture imagines the lover as a great admirer. Classical culture imagined them as a great teacher – the person best fitted to edge us towards becoming who we should be. We are suspicious because we think of teaching in the guise of nagging: the pure demand for change, rather than an eloquent enticement to surrender our entrenched flaws.</p>
