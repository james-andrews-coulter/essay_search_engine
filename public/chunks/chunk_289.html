            <h2>7.  Choosing from Within</h2>
<p>What is self-knowledge, and self-cultivation, for? As you consider the various forms of leisure described above, you might perhaps wonder whether what is being advocated is merely a form of self-indulgence or, worse still, navel-gazing. And indeed, it might become that – if it is carried to excess, or if it stops with treating ourselves to feasts of emotional self-awareness. But the importance of self-knowledge has always been that it helps us in choosing how to live. This is in a way the major task of any conscious life, and it has never been easy; but it is made particularly difficult by certain features of our lives and our societies, and it is worthwhile to pause and consider why that is – and how to bring the processes of self-knowledge to bear on the daily dilemmas of choice, and the long-term conduct of our lives.</p>
<p>If we find making choices so difficult, that is partly because we have so many of them, and because it is so easy to make them impulsively and thoughtlessly. In an interesting book called The Challenge of Affluence, the sociologist Avner Offer analyses the paradoxical problems caused by the abundance and novelty constantly on offer (and on show) in our prosperous Western societies. ‘Affluence breeds impatience,’ he writes, ‘and impatience undermines well-being.’ By impatience, he means the inability – or the unwillingness – to postpone immediate gratification. Why deprive ourselves of a lovely leather bag beckoning us from a shop window? Why spend the evening studying for a distant degree, when we could be going to a party? Why, in fact, resist the impulse to jump into bed with someone we met on Tinder, in the service of protecting a relationship which is just developing and uncertain?</p>
<p>Impatience, and the temptation to make impulsive, instantaneous choices in our daily lives, is of course greatly increased by our habituation to the rhythms of digital technologies, and the response we get from them, at a click of a mouse or a keyboard button. And following a pleasurable impulse is sometimes fine and perfectly enjoyable; but if we habitually give in to instant stimulus (of goods, or food, or sex), we may in fact achieve not gratification or pleasure, but regret – and consequences which can be quite unpleasant (frequent hangovers or unnecessary bank-debt may be among them). If we are to make good choices – and choices which are good for us – we need to distinguish what is meaningful from what is trivial, to differentiate between momentary pleasures, and our long-term aims and purposes.</p>
<p>On that more essential level, the process of making decisions is complicated not only by the problems of plenitude, but by an exceptional degree of individual freedom we enjoy – and struggle with – in our lives. In our contemporary, open, diverse societies, we are in principle (if not always in actual circumstances) free not only to follow our consumer preferences but, in most areas of our lives, to do pretty much what we want and as we like. We can choose the careers we want to follow, the lifestyles we want to adopt, whether to have children and in what manner to conceive them, the sex of our partners – and sometimes our own. At the same time, there have been very few societies which have offered their members so few shared codes of behaviour or assumptions about what is right or wrong, desirable or forbidden, to guide or restrict their decisions. We can choose our values, just as we choose our consumer preferences.</p>
<p>The temptations of plenitude and the problems of freedom extend not only to inanimate goods, but to human beings – and to our most intimate relationships. If there are so many potential partners out there, why settle on one? And how on earth do we decide whether he or she is ‘the right one’? In her book Why Love Hurts, a thought-provoking analysis of this problem, the sociologist Eva Illouz talks to men who leave what may seem like perfectly satisfactory relationships, out of some vague sense that somewhere out there, there may be something or someone better – someone more exciting, more compatible, or altogether less imperfect than the partners they have discarded. There are no social codes to stop them; no great opprobrium attached to serial relationships, or even infidelity; and no absolute imperative to maintain lifelong monogamy. The situation, in this respect, is somewhat different for women, who have the biological clock to contend with. But to a large extent, for women as well as for men, the easy possibility of changing partners often leads not to pleasurable hedonism, but to ambivalence and inner conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, there are limits our societies place on our behaviour towards others; but short of criminal transgressions, our choices, in the essential areas of life, really are individual – what we do is up to us. This is a form of personal liberty few of us would want to give up, but the lack of guiding codes for behaviour creates its own difficulties and uncertainties. It also means that the need to reflect on what we want to do, to arrive at our decisions thoughtfully, is all the greater.</p>
<p>To return to my rather driven friend, Peter: let’s imagine that he has had an offer of a high-powered job abroad; a job which would be gratifying to his ambition, but which would be very stressful and take him away from his friends, his home, his familiar and well-loved surroundings. Peter is lucky to live in a society in which such options are open to him, but he is not without ambivalence about this offer. In the absence of all external constraints, how is he supposed to arrive at his decision? On the basis of what principles or criteria?</p>
<p>One method of doing so, practised by many people, is to make a list of pros and cons of the new job, and to weigh them against each other. A person favouring this method of decision-making might put, say, better salary, new challenges, getting away from the boss, adventure on the ‘pro’ side of the equation, and terrible climate, political violence, leaving a promising relationship, uncertainty about long-term prospects on the other.</p>
<p>Making decisions on the basis of such calculations is one version of what is called rational choice: that is, choice made, supposedly, in the service of our own best interests. But it turns out that ascertaining what those interests are in the first place, and following the dictates of pure reason in trying to attain them, is not at all simple. Even in the area of personal finance, where one might think the criteria for choice are simple – we want to make optimal profits from our investments – our decision-making is often driven by needs which are quite ‘irrational’. There is the problem of excessive impulsiveness, in this area as in others, or of being driven by wishful thinking and unfounded hope. One instance of this was detailed in a long and poignant account by David Denby, the smart and sceptical film critic for the New Yorker, in which he described his obsessive quest to make a million dollars during the economic bubble of the late 1990s – in the course of which he lost a sizeable amount of money he could not afford. Denby fortunately had professional and other resources to draw on once the bubble of his fantasy had burst; but for others, the consequences of such wishful, or magical, thinking can be more destructive.</p>
<p>In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, divides human consciousness into ‘System 1’ – which produces our instant and involuntary perceptions, such as recognition of colours or words written in our language, and which may lead us, for example, to stop at a red traffic light without pausing to think about it – and ‘System 2’, which includes more complex processes of thought, and may lead us, say, to consider why traffic rules are necessary, and how they could be improved. On the basis of many precise studies, Kahneman argues that making decisions according to the subliminal system of perceptions and intuitions often works better than bringing rational considerations to them. This is partly because we are so bad at making rational predictions – at taking into account, for example, statistics on the success of investments and the causes of such success – and therefore we might as well follow our hunches as to whether we like a product or an idea on offer.</p>
<p>That is all very well when applied to simple, one-off choices: I will invest in this/I will not invest in this. Indeed, if we wanted to be coldly rational about making such decisions, we would probably entrust them to a computer and think about them no more. But what about more complex life decisions?</p>
<p>To follow up on Peter’s not uncommon dilemma: in his case, the ‘rational’ process of making a list of pros and cons did not yield a convincing answer – as it wouldn’t for many of us. But perhaps that is because the conception of rationality implied in the notion of rational choice is itself too limited. Arriving at complex life decisions – decisions which involve not only commodities, but our selves – cannot be done by statistical calculation, if only because we are not statistically constructed. There are companies that try to devise algorithms which calculate our conscious and unconscious consumer preferences, but this implies a horribly mechanistic idea of what and who we are. If we are not to give in to such a reduced conception of ourselves as we grapple with fundamental choices, we need to bring to bear on them a different and richer understanding of rationality – that is, an understanding which includes all our powers of consciousness, thoughtfulness and subjectivity. We need not only to compute, but to think feelingly.</p>
<p>This is where the fuller, more three-dimensional insights we gain through introspection and cultivation of what might be called ‘deep knowledge’ can come to our aid. For example, Emma, who has had some practice of self-reflection, may bring a different set of considerations to a prospect of a new job abroad. She may, by dint of understanding the sources of her hidden envy, feel less driven by the desire to overleap one of her successful colleagues as she decides whether to accept a seemingly tempting offer. Competitiveness may become a less compelling motive, and she may be able to concentrate more fully on the personal and professional meanings the job has to her. Her father used to work for an international company, and when she was a child she thought this was very glamorous. She’s still drawn to the adventure of living in an unfamiliar country, and exploring its landscapes and culture. This is a motive she doesn’t disapprove of, and she may follow its call. At the same time, as she sits over a cup of coffee and ruminates, she is aware of a kind of anticipatory regret tugging at her as well – regret at the thought of leaving her nice, comfy flat, and her interesting and lively circle of friends, with whom she communicates so easily. She may not ultimately give in to this homing instinct, but she needs to acknowledge it, to stay with these more difficult or sadder feelings of potential loss for a while as she tries to arrive at her decision.</p>
<p>But as noted before, Emma thinks of herself as an ethical person; and as she considers the new job, she wonders whether it fits more abstract criteria of what is good or worthwhile. The reading she has done, and her sense of both the possibilities and limits of human action, may inform her thinking about this. The insights garnered from books which have been important to her have seeped into her consciousness, even if she cannot cite specific passages which have influenced her. In concrete terms, she approves of the aims of the company for which she is being recruited – a charity dedicated to improving business practices in an African country – even if she needs to find out more about the people running it. But she also feels a nagging worry, which at some point she needs to articulate, that in emphasizing her social consciousness she may be evading responsibilities and loyalties of a more personal kind: to her elderly parents, a friend who is ill and depends upon her help, a man with whom she has begun to be involved. Is her embrace of social responsibility, paradoxically, an easy way out? Is it a way of avoiding the complications of intimacy and close relationships, which she has always found difficult?</p>
<p>The choice Emma needs to make involves not only self-interest, but ethics; not only considerations of enjoyment, but her beliefs about what is important and meaningful, and what is not. This is a balancing act – or an act of self-knowledge – we all have to perform as we try to arrive at important decisions. We need to reckon both with our preferences – what we like and enjoy – and our values – our sense of what is good and worthwhile – and to integrate our motives with the meanings we ascribe to our actions. We do not often talk about values these days, especially moral ones; they are usually associated with conservative rhetoric, and are not generally seen as a ‘cool’ concept. And yet, even if we don’t have a shared language of vices or virtues, we seem to be inescapably moral creatures, and our emotions and perhaps even instincts have inescapably moral implications.</p>
<p>The ‘realist’ view holds that natural emotions – those developed through evolution and for evolutionary purposes – are amoral. We need to fight our enemies for survival, and find the best breeding partners, no matter what their personality traits, in the service of those impersonal ‘selfish genes’. (Hence the suspicion that the language of morality is sentimental.) But in fact, it turns out that our kinder and gentler emotions are also very much a part of our evolutionary legacy. Aside from fighting enemies, our evolutionary development has depended on the human ability to cooperate and treat each other fairly, to be attached to other members of a group, and take care of each other. Children have a passionate sense of justice, and are often upset if they or others are treated unfairly. Compassion for others, and the impulse to help if we see others in trouble, is expressed early on, and may be built into the structure of the brain. Possibly this happens via the recently discovered ‘mirror neurons’ – the neurons which mimic the gestures and facial expressions and moods of our interlocutors, in a kind of physiologically encoded instinct for empathy.</p>
<p>But in our adult lives, these nascent instincts develop into more considered attitudes and values – beliefs which direct our responses, and give our emotions particular meanings. In some cultures and circumstances, both Emma’s and Peter’s decisions about whether to accept or reject a new job offer might be made easier by certain shared codes of conduct. There are societies in which ambition and success are primary goods, and in which it would be a no-brainer to accept the offer of a high-powered job; there are others in which ambition is seen as faintly unsavoury, and in which attachment to your family is an overriding emotion and good. If we grew up in Japan, say, we might honour the authority of our parents or our corporation without much questioning, or be prone to a terrible sense of shame if we did not fulfil some of our responsibilities.</p>
<p>The dilemma facing us in our own relativist cultures is that they offer very few such norms or guidelines for what constitutes good or bad behaviour – especially in the areas of responsibility and long-term commitment. In most spheres of life, we need to mould and articulate our values through self-examination and informed thoughtfulness. We need to ponder not only what we are like, but who we want to be – what qualities or attitudes in ourselves we want to affirm, and what we do not admire. In other words, we need to create our own guideposts for important decisions – our own ethical, as well as emotional, criteria for choice.</p>
<p>Beyond the question of whether the new job meets her moral considerations, Emma wants to figure out how it fits in with her larger or long-term goals – the sense of purpose which she wants to animate her life. Having an overarching purpose helps us distinguish what is important from what is not, and gives orientation to our thoughts and our actions; but under contemporary conditions, finding such organizing principles for our lives is not at all easy. In a world of multiple possibilities and constant change, how do we settle on one overriding aim? How do we decide whether ‘settling’ on anything, or committing ourselves to plans or projects that eliminate other possibilities, is desirable – or good? Isn’t it better – nobler, even – to keep ourselves open to new experiences?</p>
<p>In his wry and insightful memoir A Sense of Direction, the young American writer Gideon Lewis-Kraus tackles just this problem, and comes up with complicated answers. At a loose end in Brooklyn, he moves to Berlin, where he experiences for a while what might be called radical, hedonistic freedom. He meets other expats, most of whom refer to themselves as artists, cruises galleries with them and parties in super-cool clubs till dawn. In other words, he indulges in what should be a succession of pure pleasures; but after a while, the pleasures cease to be pleasurable at all. His lifestyle is depleting, depressing and ultimately boring. He urgently needs to find an activity that will give him a plan and an aim – what he calls, metaphorically and concretely, a sense of direction. He decides to go on a pilgrimage in Spain, and subsequently in two other countries as well.</p>
<p>Pilgrimages undertaken, as in his case, in a secular spirit have become very popular recently, and for good reasons. In conditions of radical freedom, a pilgrimage is a model of a certain kind of purpose. Trekking for days to a destination which once had profound religious meaning, but is now simply a clear goal at the end of a journey, gives Gideon a liberating sense of structure and a daily task which he does not need to question each morning. In a sense, it teaches him the process of making decisions – of choosing personal aims, and sticking to them. His goal is arbitrary, but it is meaningful to him; and it requires, for the time it lasts, a resolute sense of commitment. Not finishing the pilgrimage, whatever its hardships, would be a betrayal of his sense of self-esteem. (The long hours of silent walking also, not so incidentally, give him time to reflect on his emotional history quite intensely; and eventually to reconcile with his father, with whom he had good reasons to be angry.)</p>
<p>In our adult lives, we hope to find purposes which last longer than the few weeks of a pilgrimage. For the classical philosophers, such basic aims were found in the quest for self-knowledge itself; or in living temperately and without excessive expectations; or in living virtuously. In our contemporary lives, such guiding principles are not available from the outside. We need to decide on our aspirations from within. But if we do so through a three-dimensional understanding of ourselves, we can endow our choices and actions with significance – that sense of meaningfulness from which true satisfaction proceeds.</p>
<p>We don’t know what decision Emma ultimately made about her job. But she needed to give herself the space for thought in order to really know, so to speak, what she was doing, and to attain a kind of cognitive consonance about her decision – to make not only a well-calculated choice, but one to which she could give her full assent. Once she had given full brief to her motives and reasons, her uncertainty and ambivalence were replaced by a bracing sense of clarity. She knew what she wanted to do.</p>
