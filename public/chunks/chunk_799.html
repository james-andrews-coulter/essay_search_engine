            <h2>TOLERATING AMBIVALENCE</h2>
<p>One of the ideas about which therapy remains most sanguine is that our feelings are seldom pure. There is rarely a love which is not, at some level, accompanied by a kind of hatred, just as there is rarely a disdain that doesn’t have a strand of affection concealed somewhere within it.</p>
<p>Therapy knows that there are few loving mothers who do not, at points, wish their babies dead. And few respectful, affectionate children who do not fantasize that their parents might be annihilated, if only for a while. It knows, too, that it’s wholly normal to love someone and fantasize about having sex with someone else; or to completely forget why we ever committed to a partner only to recover the thread of our story a few hours later. Therapy is unbothered by the strangeness of our disloyal and entangled feelings. It knows that we are all a good deal stranger than we’re allowed to admit and it lets us be as unconventional as is helpful without judging or taking fright.</p>
<p>A lover schooled in therapy can adopt a similar sangfroid. Of course there will be moments of intense hatred and declarations of catastrophe and panic. But this is no reason to think a relationship is doomed—just as a two-year-old child who bites their mother in a fit of frustration in the kitchen is not to be understood as making any long-term statement about their feelings for her. With the example of therapy in mind, we’ll be less upset by squalls, less frightened of viciousness, and better able to hear with wry patience that we are apparently a shit-faced bastard who ruined someone’s life—only, ten minutes later, to hear an addendum that we are also someone our partner will love to eternity. Anger and irritation don’t destroy love; they are inevitable parts of being genuinely close to and extremely dependent on another human being.</p>
<p>A therapeutic attitude taps into a proper recognition of the many contradictions of the mind. It prepares us for the fact that, if we are ever to make a good shared life together with someone, we’ll have no option but to confront and accept—and in the end finally love—the infinitely strange and wondrous complexity of a fellow human.</p>
<p>3 Simpler Relationships</p>
<p>Many people, after they’ve been in a relationship for some time, will privately admit that they are in many ways frustrated and disappointed by the person they’ve chosen to share their lives with. If pressed for details, they will have no difficulty coming up with a list of complaints about their partner:</p>
<p>is too loyal to their irritating family</p>
<p>doesn’t share their views on the layout of the living room</p>
<p>never wants to go camping</p>
<p>plays tennis every Wednesday evening, no matter what</p>
<p>doesn’t like Moroccan food</p>
<p>doesn’t share their enthusiasm for nineteenth-century Russian novels</p>
<p>has a friend who laughs for no apparent reason</p>
<p>likes doing jigsaws</p>
<p>drinks coffee from a big mug with “1984” inscribed on the side</p>
<p>has a habit of adding “actually” to every second sentence, when it’s actually redundant . . .</p>
<p>As the list gets longer, they sigh. They still love their partner and long to be happy with them, it’s just that it seems impossibly complicated to make this relationship work.</p>
<p>What’s driving the frustration isn’t that they’ve sadly fallen for an idiot as a mate; it’s rather that we have all inherited needlessly complicated ideas of what a relationship is supposed to be for. We are told that love is meant to involve the almost total merger of two lives: We expect that a loving couple must live in the same house, eat the same meals together every night, share the same bed, go to sleep and get up at the same time, only ever have sex with, or even sexual thoughts about, each other, regularly see each other’s families, have all their friends in common, and pretty much think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful vision, but a hellish one too, for it places an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another human. We feel our partner must be right for us in every way, and if they’re not, then they have to be prodded and cajoled into reform.</p>
<p>But there’s another perspective: relationships don’t have to be so complicated and ambitious if we keep in view what in the end actually makes them fulfilling. If we boil matters down, there might really be—as we have seen—only five essential things we want from one another. The things we have to make an intelligent fuss about concern our core emotional requirements, which broadly give rise to our five fundamental demands. Our requests to our lovers might sound as follows:</p>
<p>I need you to accept—often and readily—the possibility that you might be at fault, without this feeling to you like the end of the world. You have to allow that I can have a legitimate criticism and still love you. I need you to be undefensive.</p>
<p>I need you to own up to what you are embarrassed or awkward about in yourself. I need you to know how to access the younger parts of you without terror. I need you to be able to be vulnerable around me.</p>
<p>I need you to respond warmly, gently, and compassionately to the fragile parts of who I am; to listen to, and understand, my sorrows. We need a union of mutual tenderness.</p>
<p>I need you to have a complex, nuanced picture of me and to understand the emotional burdens I’m carrying, even though I wish I weren’t, from the past. You have to see me with something like the generosity associated with therapy.</p>
<p>I need you to regularly air your disappointments and irritations with me—and for me to do the same with you—so that the currents of affection between us can remain warm and our capacity for admiration intense.</p>
<p>If these five critical demands have been met, we will feel loved and essentially satisfied whatever differences then crop up in a hundred other areas. Perhaps our partner’s friends or routines won’t be a delight, but we will be content. Just as if we lack these emotional goods, and yet agree on every detail of European literature, interior design, and social existence, we are still likely to feel lonely and bereft.</p>
<p>By limiting what we expect a relationship to be about, we can overcome the tyranny and bad temper that bedevil so many lovers. A good, simpler—yet very fulfilling—relationship could end up in a minimal state. We might not socialize much together. We might hardly ever encounter each other’s families. Our finances might overlap only at a few points. We could be living in different places and only meet up twice a week. Conceivably we might not even ask too many questions about each other’s sex life. But when we do come together it would be profoundly gratifying, because we would be in the presence of someone who knew how to be kind, vulnerable, and understanding.</p>
<p>A bond between two people can be deep and important precisely because it is not played out across all practical details of existence. By simplifying and clarifying what a relationship is for, we release ourselves from overly complicated conflicts and can focus on making sure our urgent underlying needs are sympathized with, seen, and understood.</p>
<p>4 Untragic Endings</p>
<p>News of the end of a relationship tends to be greeted with deep solemnity in our societies. It is hard to think of a breakup except in terms of a minor tragedy. People will offer condolences as they might after a funeral.</p>
<p>This in turn reflects an underlying philosophy of love: we are taught that the natural and successful outcome of any love story is to remain with a person until their or our death. So, by implication, any breakup must be interpreted as a failure governed by overwhelming hostility on one or both sides.</p>
<p>But there’s another scenario in which we understand that we are separating not because our relationship has gone badly but precisely because it has gone well. It is ending because it has succeeded. Rather than breaking up with feelings of hurt, bitterness, regret, and guilt, we’re parting with a sense of mutual gratitude and joint accomplishment.</p>
<p>This counterintuitive but real possibility has an unexpected source. It comes from having kept a crucial question in mind throughout our time together: What is this relationship for? The enquiry may feel negative; we can imagine asking it in a deeply disillusioned tone of voice. But it can and should be asked positively and eagerly—with the aim of finding a good answer that goes to the heart of love.</p>
<p>Normally, we imagine love as a kind of ownership: full of admiration, two people agree to buy one another, as they might a static, beguiling object. But there is another, more dynamic and less hidebound way to interpret love: as a particular kind of education. In this view, a relationship essentially comprises a mutual attempt to learn from and teach something to another person. We are drawn to our partners because we want to be educated by them and vice versa. We love them because we see in them things that we long for that are missing in us; we aspire to grow under the tutelage of love.</p>
<p>For example, a partner might at the outset have been confident but gentle—a combination that, until we met them, seemed impossible. Or they knew how to laugh at themselves, while we were too withheld and solemn to do so. Or they had a practical competence that we found delightful and moving precisely because it was lacking in us. We could accurately say in such cases that the purpose of the relationship was to teach us confidence or gentleness, or how to laugh at our own idiocy or to become more dexterous—or a thousand other qualities depending on who we both are. The point is, there will be some specific and highly important things we need to do together that will define what the relationship is for.</p>
<p>By being with our partner, by intertwining our lives, by listening to them, even by being criticized or nagged by them, we will gradually be able to internalize what they have to teach us. But there may legitimately come a point where we have absorbed as much from them as we can. Thanks to our partner, we really are more mature beings than we were when we got together: we’re more balanced and wiser; they’ve helped us to become a little more like the people we always wished to be.</p>
<p>Precisely because our relationship has had a great, intimate, loving purpose, it can get completed. It can be finished in the sense in which a novel can be finished—not because the writer has got sick of the trials of writing but because they have, through plenty of difficulties, brought the project to a good resolution. Or, more poignantly perhaps, a relationship can be finished in the way that childhood can be finished: a child—thanks to the immense devotion of their parents—reaches a point at which, in order to progress further, they need to leave home. They’re not being kicked out in anger or running away in despair; they’re leaving because the work of childhood has been done. This isn’t a rejection of love; it is love’s good consequence. Finishing isn’t a sign of failure but of background success.</p>
<p>The difference in these cases is that we’ve clearly understood what all our efforts were for. There was a goal in mind: The writing shouldn’t go on for ever, the child should leave home. But because, unfortunately, we have not asked what our relationship is for, we can’t normally get to this sense of having reached a proper ending. Or else we are refusing to ask because the only motive for the relationship is to ensure that we are not alone—which is never, when we reflect on it, really a good enough reason to monopolize someone else’s life.</p>
<p>In an ideal relationship, the sense of completion would be completely mutual. The painful reality, however, is that we may sometimes want to leave while our partner wants us to stay together. But the idea of love as education can still apply: Our unbearable conflicts mean that we’ve stopped being able to teach one another anything. We may know important qualities they should learn but we’re not the right teacher: We currently lack the patience, the skill, the charm, or the self-confidence to transmit insights in a way that will work for them. We have done all we can. Our task is complete, not because our partner has nothing left to learn, but because we aren’t the right person to guide them. We are entitled to leave without feeling we are abandoning anyone.</p>
<p>We can avoid feeling devastated by a breakup knowing that there are still so many other ways in which we need to develop. We may have learned so much but we’re still far from complete. It’s just that the lessons we now have to take on board are going to come from someone else—or from the always profoundly educative experience of being on our own for a while.</p>
