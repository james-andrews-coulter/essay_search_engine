        <h3>¶ Artistic Consolation</h3>
<p>We live in what is often a vibrantly optimistic, jollying culture that subtly stigmatises feelings of sorrow. But around certain works of art we’re invited to a very different view of darkness. These art works remember how much of life deserves solemn and mournful states. The private agonies of our souls have been the subjects of art down the ages: unhappy love, discrimination, anxiety, sexual humiliation, rivalry, regret, shame, isolation and frustrated longing are the core of the artistic canon.</p>
<p>The great sad works do not cheer us up by directing our thoughts towards happy scenes. They do so via a more sombre but effective route: they show us that we are not alone in our griefs.</p>
<p>Standing as a record of the tears of humanity, art lends legitimacy to despair and replays our miseries back to us with dignity, shorn of many of their haphazard or trivial particulars. ‘A book [though the same could be said of any art form] must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us,’ proposed Kafka; in other words, an art work is a tool to help release us from our numbness, to allow us to shed tears and to provide occasions for catharsis in areas where we have for too long been damagingly brave.</p>
