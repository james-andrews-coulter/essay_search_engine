        <h2>LOVING AND BEING LOVED</h2>
<p>We learn about love, initially, by being loved. If things went moderately well in childhood, we have powerful memories of being (at least from time to time) on the receiving end of immense understanding kindness. And very little was expected in return. Our caregivers didn’t assume that – aged three or six – we could solve their problems; they didn’t expect us to listen carefully to their heartaches or shoulder a range of domestic responsibilities; they didn’t berate us for not making enough money or for being too materialistic. Often enough, in their eyes we were deeply lovely and they readily embraced the tasks of nurturing our strengths and consoling our woes; in return they only hoped for the occasional hug and sweet smile. We learned a huge amount about what it feels like to be loved.</p>
<p>This childhood experience feels to us like the normal template of a loving relationship. In our eyes, the parent’s love was natural and instinctive: of course they were there to pat our head, enquire tenderly and patiently about the little incidents of our day, to cheer us on, to share our troubles and to look after us without asking for us to do the equivalent for them. Largely, the parents carefully shielded us from insight into what their devotion to us cost them. They didn’t say that they were on the point of losing their temper with us five times but managed to hold back; they didn’t explain that they dropped into bed utterly worn out and depleted; they didn’t usually let us see the degree of inner conflict they felt; however much they loved us, they feared they were trading portions of their lives making us sandwiches and calming us down when they should have been building their careers. We didn’t know what it was really like for them – and, in a sense, we didn’t really care.</p>
<p>In adulthood, we encounter love in the guise of feeling loved. But for a relationship to survive we need to do something very tricky: we need to become like the parent whose efforts we never understood. We want to be loved, but we have to be loving in return. The pure demand to be loved is disastrous, because no-one except a parent can settle for such a degree of inequality. We have to become, at least sometimes, the one who subordinates their desires to the comfort and security of the other; we need to listen, without particularly being listened to; we need to sympathise even though, at the moment, it’s all one way; we need to appear charmed even if inside we’re a touch bored; we need – perhaps for the first time – to do what a parent did for us and put the interests of another, briefly but truly, ahead of our own. Marriage may be summarised as the project of doing an utterly remarkable thing: surrendering at points our hungry claims to being loved in order to take on the new and unfamiliar burdens of actually loving.</p>
