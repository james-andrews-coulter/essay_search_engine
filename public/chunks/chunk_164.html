            <h2>12.The Pleasure of Otherness</h2>
<p>Only a few hours ago, you were at home; now you’re here, in the souk in the Old Medina in Casablanca. There’s a man, who must be a decade older than you, sitting on a worn leather stool in a little booth selling pistachios, preserved lemons and harissa paste. This might have been his life for the last twenty years or so. His radio is playing music by someone you don’t recognise, but who is probably a huge star, with a powerful voice that soars as she repeats a word that sounds like ‘eleh’. You’ve travelled a long way to go and see the Hassan II Mosque. For him, it’s just a typical backdrop to ordinary life – as familiar and unremarkable as your queen’s palace might be to you.</p>
<p>Or you’re in the German capital, in a small bar in Kreuzberg, around the corner from the hotel you’ve just checked into; it’s quite busy, even though it’s the middle of the afternoon. There are candles lit on all the wonky tables; next to you, a good-looking couple are having an intense conversation in which the words Kultur and Philosophie keep getting stressed; a middle-aged woman is immersed in a thick book (about Schopenhauer) and taking rapid notes; at quiet moments the bartender is skimming through a newspaper – Die Zeit – which, you notice, features a large mathematical equation on the front page.</p>
<p>What we can feel at such moments is a basic pleasure at encountering ‘otherness’: practices, customs, habits and vocabularies that are strikingly at odds with those we know from home and which give us a welcome reminder of the sheer diversity and complexity of the world. From a settled vantage point, it’s only too easy to picture humanity as homogeneous and, therefore, a little dull and prescriptive. But this isn’t a view which can survive the first few hours in a new country. We’re quickly reminded that, for all the talk of globalisation, places retain a fascinating, welcome distinctiveness. The smells, the sounds, the bread, the light at dawn, people’s shoes, the way of making tea, the arrangements of the taps and sockets, the light at 5pm… everything is satisfyingly ‘other’. This can become an invitation to explore alternative ways of living and thinking. There may be many more routes to being happy than the ones we’ve explored to date. Perhaps we can make the changes that had felt so impossible before.</p>
<p>All this the pistachio-seller is subtly helping us to remember. We might buy a packet or two from him to cement the lesson.</p>
