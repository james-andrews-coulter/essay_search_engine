        <h2>4. Creativity</h2>
<p>Virginia Woolf’s essay ‘A Room of One’s Own’ (1929, new edition: Penguin, 2002) is a famous feminist text. It is also a flamboyant, funny and clever
  polemic, which is well worth reading if you want to think about creativity, especially in the arts.</p>
<p>For people with no maths (like me) who would like to understand more about the explosive creative period in the 1920s when quantum mechanics was ‘discovered’, including
  Heisenberg’s contribution, I have written a story called ‘On Sneezing an Uncertain Sneeze’ in a collection entitled Moss Witch and Other Stories (Comma, 2013). All the
  fictional stories in the book are about science and are accompanied by mini-essays by eminent scientists. Jim Al-Khalili has written ‘Three Years That Changed Physics Forever’ to go
  with my story, explaining what Heisenberg and his colleagues were up to and why it mattered so much.</p>
