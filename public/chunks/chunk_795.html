        <h3>2. When we despair of being understood</h3>
<p>Love starts with the experience of being understood in a deeply supportive and uncommon way. They understand the lonely parts of you; they grasp who you truly are. This will not continue. There will always be large tracts of one’s psyche that remain incomprehensible to anyone else.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t blame our lovers for a dereliction of duty in failing to interpret and grasp our internal workings. They were not tragically inept. They simply couldn’t understand who we were and what we needed – which is entirely normal. No one properly understands, and can therefore fully sympathise with, anyone else.</p>
