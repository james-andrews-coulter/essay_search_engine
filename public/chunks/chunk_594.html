            <h3>¶ Fashion</h3>
<p>Once, we were all dressed by someone else. Parents picked out a T-shirt; the school dictated what colour our trousers should be. But at some point, we were granted the opportunity to discover who we might be in the world of clothes. We had to decide for ourselves about collars and necklines, fit, colours, patterns, textures and what goes (or doesn’t go) with what. We learnt to speak about ourselves in the language of garments. Despite the potential silliness and exaggeration of sections of the fashion industry, assembling a wardrobe is a serious and meaningful exercise.</p>
<p>Based on our looks, background, job or certain tendencies in our behaviour, others are liable to come to quick and not very rounded decisions about who we are. Only too often, their judgement doesn’t get us right. They might assume that, because of where we come from, we must be quite snobbish or resentful; based on our work we might get typecast as dour or superficial; the fact that we’re sporty might lead people to see us as not terribly cerebral; an attachment to a particular political outlook might be associated with being unnervingly earnest or cruel.</p>
<p>Clothes provide us with an opportunity to correct some of these assumptions. When we get dressed, we are, in effect, operating as a tour guide, offering to show people around ourselves. We’re highlighting interesting or attractive things about who we are – and we’re clearing up misconceptions in the process.</p>
<p>We’re acting like artists painting a self-portrait: deliberately guiding the viewer’s perception of who we might be. Clothes are a way of making a crucial introduction to the self. This explains the curious phenomenon whereby, if we’re staying with good friends, we can spend a lot less time thinking about our clothes, compared with the anxiety about what to wear that can grip us at other times. We might sit around in a dressing gown. They already know who we are; they’re not relying on our clothes for clues.</p>
<p>By choosing particular sorts of clothes, we are shoring up our more fragile or tentative characteristics. We’re communicating to others who we are and strategically reminding ourselves. Our wardrobes contain some of our most carefully written lines of autobiography.</p>
