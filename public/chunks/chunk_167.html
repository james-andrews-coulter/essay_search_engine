            <h2>15.The Importance of Family Holidays</h2>
<p>It’s because we’re all such intuitive experts in knowing how they can go wrong that it’s worth remembering what – at their best – family holidays can achieve. The point has little to do with the destination or the thrills of the itinerary: it lies in the capacity of a trip to cement the bonds of affection between family members; in the power of a trip to make a family.</p>
<p>For a start, trips erase the normal hierarchy between generations. A child gets to see their parents in unfamiliar – and often usefully less than impressive – situations. A father looks awkward in swimming trunks, a bulging stomach no longer disguised by a carefully fitted suit; or a mother – who is normally effortlessly in charge – is revealed as rather shy when it comes to trying to order from a foreign menu. With their frailties and limitations more on show, parents are humanised. A father turns out to be very nervous about being splashed in the pool, a mother is useless at building sandcastles. A child has a chance to be a parental equal or superior. When it comes to manoeuvring a rowing boat into the jetty or buying tomatoes at the market, a ten-year-old might be as adept as – or more skilled than – a parent; there’s a new, welcome experience of equality.</p>
<p>There are associated benefits in experiencing danger together: in being caught out in a rainstorm after the museum, in getting lost in the bazaar, in needing to sort out a stolen wallet, in having to find somewhere to sleep at 11pm. At the time, these discomforts feel like an interruption of the real point of the trip. Only later do we realise that they are what helped us to get to know one another properly and overcome the egocentricity and reserve of home.</p>
<p>A trip is helpful, too, in allowing parents to see the world through the unjaded eyes of their children. The normal hierarchies of pleasure are upturned and new delights unearthed. The breakfast buffet at the hotel becomes thrilling in a way it otherwise never would, because for a five-year-old child, few things are as delightful as being allowed to carry a small plate around and choose freely from three kinds of bread and explore strange combinations of cheese and strawberries or a sausage and smoked salmon. The museum of art has nothing to rival this. In the company of children, we notice how conservative our adult sensibilities have become. We realise we have forgotten how enchanting a small lizard can be or how much fun is available from timing jumps over a succession of small waves.</p>
<p>When adolescence arrives, the family holiday often loses its sweetness; the child wants to remain at home or go out with their friends; it would be horrible to go for a walk along the beach with parents or join them on the tennis court. The death of the family holiday in adolescence is – ironically – quite probably the very earliest move towards a new epoch of family holidays, due to start in two decades’ time or so. The rejection of the parents, which seems so harsh right now, is what will allow children, in turn, to have a family of their own one day – and eventually to end up doing all the things they currently most disdain. They’ll be singing in the paddling pool and pretending their ice cream is too hot; they’ll make unfunny jokes with the best will in the world and won’t care very much that there’s a coffee stain on their ill-fitting T-shirt. They too will come to learn the invaluable benefits of a family trip away.</p>
