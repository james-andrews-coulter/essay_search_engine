        <h4>Kindness</h4>
<p>A lot of our reality deserves compassion and sympathy. How compelling, therefore, to come across someone whose features might belie a willingness to extend charity towards a lot that is less than perfect in human nature; someone who could know how much we need forgiveness, and who could laugh generously with and at us – because they know how to do the same in relation to themselves.</p>
<p>We have allowed our concern for sexiness to be coarsened by physical obsession because we are under the sway of an overly simplistic biological sense of what sex might be aiming at. Yet by recovering contact with some of what we emotionally crave from another person, we can rediscover that the real turn-on is never just a well-polished body but, always and primordially, a well-fashioned soul.</p>
