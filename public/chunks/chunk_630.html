        <h3>¶ Meaningful Work</h3>
<p>When we talk about jobs being meaningful or meaningless, we are at heart asking whether these jobs are helping anyone’s life to be better: we’re wondering whether our work stands a chance of increasing someone’s pleasure or reducing their suffering. Unlike what standard economics tells us, we are desperate to make a significant contribution to the good. It is hard to be happy at work without a sense that we have proved of assistance to someone else.</p>
<p>One of the greatest enemies of ‘meaning’ in the modern world is the sheer scale of businesses. Corporations coordinate the labours of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of people – and raise productivity exponentially. But extreme specialisation and global reach can gravely reduce the sense of meaning that any one employee might have. A packaging supervisor in Malmö might not have much idea of how their work fits in with the activities of a geochemist in Ghana who compares activated alumina with indigenous laterite and bauxite as potential sorbents for removing fluoride from drinking water, or with the concerns of a legal expert currently staying in the Alvear Hotel in Buenos Aires and reporting to a steering committee in New York about the implications of proposed revisions to Section 14 of the Argentine Mining Code. All these individuals might be working for the same rather noble cause, but none of them can quite remember day to day what the real cause actually is.</p>
<p>Most work now takes place within gigantic organisations that are engaged in a variety of large, complicated and slow-moving projects. Therefore it can be hard to derive, on a daily basis, any tangible sense of having improved anyone else’s life. The customer and the end product are, in the gigantic structures of modernity, simply too far away in space and too distant in time. One can be unable easily to reassure oneself of one’s worth and purpose when one is only a single unit among a twenty-thousand-strong team on four continents pushing forward a project that might be ready in five years’ time.</p>
<p>There are sound reasons why the work practices of large organisations proceed at such scale – typically at a glacial pace. Product developments in aeronautics and banking, oil and pharmaceuticals cannot happen overnight. The timeframes are logical, but in terms of individual experience, they go directly against our natural, deeply embedded preference for a rapidly unfolding story.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed that a key requirement for a satisfying piece of theatre was that it should be over relatively quickly. There might be tensions and complications and unexpected changes of direction, but in a few hours and three acts, there should be a feeling of genuine completion. It’s not just in the theatre that speed is attractive. The concentration of action also helps to explain the appeal of sport. In ninety minutes, a football match can take us from a perfect, neutral start to a precise result.</p>
<p>However, if football were like modern work in terms of scale and pace, one can imagine it unfolding on eighteen pitches with twenty-two balls and two thousand players kicking around for thousands of days without any overview of the progress of the game. By the standards of our innate longings, our work unfolds in a very disordered, over-extended and confusing way.</p>
<p>Our labour feels meaningful not only when it is fast, but also when we get to witness the ways we are helping others: when we can leave the office, factory or shop with an impression of having fixed a problem in someone else’s life. This pleasure too is threatened by scale. In the massive organisations of modernity, we may be so distant from the end users of our products and services as to be unable to derive any real benefit from our constructive role in their lives. Spending days improving terms on contracts in the logistics industry truly will lead to a moment when a couple can contentedly enjoy some ginger biscuits together in front of the TV; optimising data management across different parts of an aerospace firm truly will – along with thousands of other coordinated efforts – contribute to the moment when a young family can bond together on a beach holiday. The connections are genuine, but they are so extended and convoluted as to feel dispiritingly flimsy and unreal in our minds.</p>
<p>It is a tantalising paradox, and a kind of tragedy, that because of the unavoidable scale of modern work, we may pass our lives helping other people and yet, day to day, be burdened by a harrowing feeling of having made no difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>Part of the answer to our feelings of disconnection and disorientation lies in a discipline at the heart of culture: the art of storytelling. As the complexity and scale of organisations increase, so we need to learn how to arrange a disparate selection of events into a master narrative that can lend them coherence and thereby remind us of how we might fit into a meaningful whole. A company’s ‘story’ has a lot in common with a large, layered novel. One can imagine a company novel that would begin with a description of someone accessing a bank account in Salzburg. The next moment, we would be in a restaurant in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, where a deal is being hammered out to transfer crates to Dubai. Then the focus would be on a meeting taking place in a basement in Whitehall, where regulations for consumer goods would be discussed between ministers and a set of civil servants. Then would come a section set in a call centre in Phoenix, closely followed by a scene in a nursery in Seattle. But rather than a hopeless confusion, the point would be to reveal how these apparently random incidents were in fact profoundly interconnected, pointing to a grand synthetic goal: the creation of a new IT system for an office in Munich, or a project to increase the flow rate of a pump production line in southern Spain.</p>
<p>Once scattered events are woven together into a story, they can start to feel very meaningful indeed. Ideally, every large company would have storytellers on the payroll.</p>
