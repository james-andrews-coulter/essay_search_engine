        <h2>Catastrophising</h2>
<p>The idea of a catastrophiser has an almost comedic ring to it. We picture someone sweet-but-silly running around feeling like the sky will cave in. ‘There they go again,’ we might say, as the catastrophiser once more insists that ‘this is the end!’ – while in fact, there’s just a small delay with the plane, the keys have been mislaid, or it’s a tickly cough.</p>
<p>But from close up, there is nothing remotely benign or funny about being the subject of catastrophic thinking. A mind prey to this disease can never picture any solid steps between the present and the very worst scenarios – only and always a direct line. If an ex-partner is unhappy with them, the catastrophiser won’t imagine that this is only one mood of theirs, that this former lover is broadly benign and understanding. Instead, the most dire conclusion is immediate: the ex will be furious and bent on unending torture. As on so many other occasions (with the disgruntled employee or the frustrated neighbour), the catastrophiser will irresistibly reach for the most awful and pitiless story. It will be impossible to sleep, they will lose their appetite, they won’t have any energy to see friends, their whole future will be called into question. There is simply no such thing as a ‘small’ issue.</p>
<p>The catastrophiser may, across most of their lives, have attained minimal insight into their way of thinking, let alone compassion for it. It seems to be just the way things are. The unfortunate catastrophiser might be on the receiving end of a great many recommendations to ‘stop worrying’.</p>
<p>What this neglects is that catastrophic thinking is a clinical condition – and that it tends to have a history. It is almost always a symptom of having encountered a real full-blown catastrophe somewhere before. It may not be an encounter with a catastrophic event so much as familiarity with catastrophic feelings – which are generally much easier to lose sight of or to be actively disguised by those who caused them for us.</p>
<p>Catastrophisers have made a deduction about what will happen on the basis of what has – at some point – already happened. They might, as a toddler, have been on the receiving end of volcanic rage from a parent. The parent might not actually have excommunicated them, but that is certainly what it felt like – in that kitchen, when the crockery was smashed, and the screaming didn’t let up for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>There is a lot of our history bound up in what we catastrophise about. A question to ask ourselves is: what bit of my past is the catastrophic scenario I fear telling me about? What does the awful thing I dread hint to me about the awful thing I have previously gone through?</p>
<p>We begin to get a handle on our catastrophic imaginations not by being told to be calm or learning about the theories of the ancient Stoics, but when we can develop the courage to explore what once went very wrong and then learn to distinguish then from now.</p>
<p>We begin to soothe ourselves by remembering that we are no longer the children we once were. We have allies, we can call professionals, we have access to law courts and hospitals. Something requires our concern; but – whatever our agitated minds so often like to tell us – it lies in the past, not the future.</p>
