        <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>How do you make the perfect home?</p>
<p>Once upon a time there lived a rich man who had everything. He possessed a happy family, a wide circle of friends, a profitable business, and a substantial reputation.</p>
<p>Or that’s how the Viennese architect Adolf Loos used to start his story, around a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>At least, he’d continue, the rich man had nearly everything; he had everything except a perfect home; and so he decided to seek advice on how he should get one. He summoned a famous
  architect and asked him what he should do. The architect went to the rich man’s house and looked around, and told him to throw out all his furniture and his clutter. He brought in an army of
  craftsmen and tradesmen and artists, and soon enough our rich man had the most beautiful house in the city.</p>
<p>Wherever he looked in his new home, he found the art of the architect: in the designer doorknobs, in the beautiful chairs, the artfully scattered cushions, the subtly patterned carpets, and in
  even the simple and elegant plates on which his dinner was served. The architect had thought of everything. Our rich man had a perfect home. His life, finally, was complete.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of books that will advise you, as Adolf Loos’s architect once advised his rich man, about how to make a home. Step into the interiors section of most bookshops, and
  you’ll find glossy guides to style, from Moroccan to Mid-Century Modern. You can find guides to the homes of the rich and famous, and catalogues of styles in French or English furniture from
  the eighteenth century. There will be DIY manuals for making curtains, distressing sideboards, fitting bedrooms into cupboards, rag-rolling walls, plumbing toilets and laying tables.</p>
<p>Literature of this kind has an ancient history. In ancient Rome, the architect Vitruvius wrote a treatise for the Emperor Augustus and the statesman Pliny described his ideal holiday house as a
  self-serving illustration of his domestic and moral probity. It’s a literature that has echoes in the moral and domestic economies of Confucianism, the Hindu Shilpa Shastras, and in
  ideal homes from William Morris’s Red House of the 1860s to Le Corbusier’s machines for living in of the 1920s.</p>
<p>Then there are guides for the perplexed housewife, written by Mrs Beeton in the nineteenth century and Martha Stewart in the twenty-first. They provide recipes not just for food, but for
  household management and etiquette, dispensing advice on how to deal with servants, get stains out of carpets, or pay a social call. This advice has in common with Pliny or Confucius a conviction
  that domestic and moral order are aligned. After all, in traditional parlance, untidiness and immorality meet in the Slut and the Slattern.</p>
<p>Then there are arbiters of taste. Elsie de Wolfe, writing on decoration in early twentieth-century America, saw herself as a missionary, bringing good taste to the masses in a way that Terence
  Conran, Ingvar Kamprad, Laura Ashley or Kelly Hoppen have followed since. Their harmoniously accessorized, standardized approaches to home décor seem to provide a formula or a kit, the
  purchase of which will help the rest of us to avoid errors in aesthetic judgement and domestic arrangement.</p>
<p>And finally, this sort of advice has made its way onto the television: Changing Rooms, asking How Clean is your House?, telling you not just How to Cook but How to
  Eat, or, to match, What Not to Wear, and how, in general, to Get Your House in Order. The drama of the TV makeover, with its limited timescale and budget, its miracles
  wrought with MDF, and the tearful (for better or for worse) Grand Reveal, is designed to show how the making of a home can make (or break) the people who live in it, too.</p>
<p>This book is not advice of that kind. Reading it will not make your home more tasteful. It will not reveal this year’s colours, or next year’s chaise. I have no clever
  table-laying tips or recipes to share. This is not a book about design, or not solely. There are, it will argue, no definitive laws we can use to create beauty or domestic harmony. I am not, I
  hope, like the architect who advised the rich man how to perfect his home.</p>
<p>But this book will attempt to answer the question contained in its title: how can you make a home? It’s a deliberately ambiguous question, for, as we shall see, making a home, being at
  home, feeling at home, or making yourself at home are things we can do anywhere, any time. Home, it will argue, is less attached to bricks and mortar, cushions and curtains, than to a sense that we
  deserve to belong in our surroundings, to shape them, to change them, and in doing so, to dwell in them.</p>
<p>This book will pose six questions: How do you build a home? How do you furnish a home? How do you decorate a home? How do you collect a home? How do you keep a home? And, finally, how can you
  make yourself at home without having one?</p>
<p>These questions take us through the elements that comprise the home: firstly the architecture of the house; secondly the furniture we carry with us from house to house; thirdly, the decoration
  of our homes; fourthly, the clutter we collect when we make a home; fifthly, that much-unloved aspect of making a home: housework; and finally, the public sphere from which, or in which, we seek
  intervals of refuge and rest.</p>
<p>Each chapter will address assumptions that have often been made about the home: that there is such a thing as an ideal home (and that it is a house); that, at home, there should be a place for
  everything, and that everything should be in its place; that ornaments are crime; that there’s no accounting for taste; that a woman’s place is in the home; and finally, that it’s
  good to be home alone.</p>
<p>But in this book, we will challenge those venerable clichés. We shall remember that most people cannot afford to build their own home; that home is in a state of perpetual motion; that
  taste is a political weapon; and that clutter can be cosmic. We’ll look at home as drudgery, and find out that, for many, privacy is an unattainable luxury.</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll encounter psychoanalysts and architects, designers and film-makers, alchemists and anthropologists, philosophers, sociologists, cooks, activists and politicians, for
  home is a subject so fundamental that it is the province of no single sphere of enquiry. In each case, we’ll critically read the advice they have dispensed to the home-makers of their time,
  considering what we agree with, what we must challenge, and how we can resolve the resulting dilemmas to make homes of our own.</p>
<p>For too long home has been idealized as a refuge from the world: ordered, where the world outside is chaotic; personal, where the world is generic; private, where the world is public. In this
  book, we’ll explore how we can make ourselves at home in public; and how home isn’t a place to which we retreat to escape the social world, but the vantage point from which we look into
  it. Home is not just our destination at the end of the day, but also the origin from which we go out in the morning.</p>
<p>For too long the ideal home has been imagined as something perfectible: an ideal object that can fit its occupants like a glove fits a hand, or a nest the blackbird that built it. In this book
  we’ll be investigating the ways in which home is often not a fixed, or fixable, place, but is instead a situation that is made and unmade in time.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this book will argue, we should worry a little bit less about how to make a home, and a little bit more about how to make ourselves at home, for, as we’ll discover,
  buildings, furniture, objects, and décor are less reliable than at first they seem.</p>
<p>It’s something our rich man discovered soon enough, as he moved into his perfect home; but if you want to find out what happened, and why, and why it’s worth knowing, you’ll
  have to take my first piece of advice, and read on.</p>
