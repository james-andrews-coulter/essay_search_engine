        <h3>Firstly: Others</h3>
<p>The most common emotion that drives us to think of ending our lives after failure is that we have ‘nothing left to live for’. As we contemplate the ruin of our career, the disapproval of friends, the mess of our marriage or the degeneration of our body, we conclude (often very understandably) that there are no plausible reasons to endure. It is at this point that we should try to call to mind something that, especially in these circumstances, can be very hard to hold on to: that there are others – many others – who are relying on us to keep living so that they can remain sane and safe, or indeed themselves continue to live. We may not be able to see these people, and if we do meet them, they may not tell us of their reliance, but the reality is that, were we to take our own life, they would find it more or less impossible ever to return to normality. They would forever take our death as an indictment against them: they would feel that they had not been able to help us as they desperately wished – and they would imagine that our death was a sign that they had not mattered enough to us and that they were therefore neither sufficiently loveable nor adequately worthy. These assumptions might not be remotely true, but it is almost certain that the people who love us would take them to be so in the days, years and decades after our demise. For a select few, our death will be something they simply never get over, and they will feel permanently abandoned. We may not see these people very much, and they may well have been angry or disappointed with us when we last encountered them, but the underlying truth is that their sanity depends on our restraint. There are probably half a dozen or so people on this list directly known to us, and another handful offstage that we might not remember too well, or never even have met, but in whose minds we are nevertheless a potent force (the brother of a friend, perhaps, or a parent of someone we were at school with). And needless to say, on this list are likely the most significant figures of all: our own parents, partners or children – whose existence must be an incontestable, non-negotiable, incontrovertible call to keep going, whatever personal horrors we are travelling through.</p>
<p>When we are muffled by despair and loss, it can seem implausible that someone as wretched as us could ever matter to another human – matter critically – but we do. Immensely. Certain people in our lives right now would quite literally never be able to digest what we are thinking of doing. No day would ever be free of the shadow thrown over them by this incident. People who take their own lives are very seldom trying to deliver an insult to anyone else, they are not trying to tell their children they don’t love them or their friends that they don’t matter, but this is how – despite every precaution – the act is likely to feel. Furthermore, the consequences of our death will ripple in unpredictable ways through society. When one member of the tribe decides the game isn’t worth it, others – ostensibly unrelated – may also despair. The news of our end, in a few lines in the local paper, may be the final encouragement needed for someone else to despair fully of their circumstances. Suicide is catching; it weakens all of our resolve to keep going.</p>
<p>We are evidently not offending God or the angels by taking our own life, but we are doing something far more tangible: we are causing devastating problems for the people around us.</p>
<p>This could feel like a dour and nihilistic philosophy: are we meant to keep going just to avoid burdening others? Is living just a socially mandated chore? It might sound dispiriting, but this idea contains a fortifying, and even releasing, message. We may indeed have nothing directly and personally left to live for, but we possess something far more important to justify our existence: the lives and happiness of other people. Living may not be our wish, but it can be something more robust: our duty.</p>
<p>When in despair, let us remind ourselves that we need to continue for the sake of someone else. We can go on in the knowledge that there is meaning in others’ lives – even when we can no longer (at least right now) see it in our own.</p>
