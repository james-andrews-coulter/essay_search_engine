        <h3>(v) Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>When relationships start, our enthusiasm for our partners tends to be at a high pitch. We think of them constantly, we want only to spend more time in their company, we delight in their many skills and accomplishments: we can’t quite get over how they know how to glide on a dance floor, prepare such tasty soups, read interesting novels, sweet-talk our hard-to-please mother or calmly perform a life-saving operation on an ailing horse or poodle.</p>
<p>But this early phase of powerful admiration and longing rarely lasts. A few years in, our partner may still be a stylish dancer, a good cook, a knowledgeable thinker, a fixed favourite of our mother or a superlative vet – and yet we now find it hard to feel or express too much wonderment. A sullenness has taken hold of us that does not lift. There is, somewhere deep inside us, a gigantic, stubborn ‘but’.</p>
<p>The corrosion of romantic enthusiasm is one of the grand, intimate, tragic and rarely told stories of love. It seems to happen almost without our noticing; we gradually slip into a position of no longer being able to admire very much. With time, we may feel loyal to the union we’ve built; we may harbour a deep friendship towards our partner; we’d give them a kidney – but we can’t relish in and celebrate their merits as we once did.</p>
<p>The world often explains this cooling as a sheer and inevitable result of exposure. It is, they say, typical that we neglect what is always around. But the true reasons seem more complicated, more psychologically rich and, in their own way, a lot more hopeful.</p>
<p>If we stop admiring, it is not because we are ever really bored or because it is ‘normal’ to take someone for granted; it is chiefly only because we are, at some level, furious. Anger creeps into love and destroys admiration. We cease to delight because we unknowingly grow entangled in various forms of unprocessed annoyance. We can’t cheer them on because, somewhere deep inside, we are inhibited by trace memories of certain let-downs, large and small, of which they have been guilty without having been informed of it, and which they haven’t been able to correct. Perhaps they caused us immense difficulties around a work crisis and never apologised. Maybe they flirted with a friend of ours and left us feeling tricked and unsure. They may have booked a holiday without asking us and then insisted that they’d done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Every infraction was not, on its own, necessarily always particularly serious, but taken cumulatively, a succession of minor disappointments can acquire a terrible capacity to dampen and ultimately destroy ardour. Yet it is not the simple fact of being let down that counts very much – the true problem is created when there hasn’t been an opportunity to process our disappointment. Irritation is only toxic when it hasn’t been extensively and thoughtfully aired.</p>
<p>Perhaps we tried to explain what was wrong but we got nowhere. The partner lost their temper and we gave up. Or, more subtly, we might not have felt entitled to make a fuss over so-called ‘small things’ and therefore stayed silent even though, in our depths, the small things mattered immensely to us. With great unfairness to our partner, we may have forgotten to admit to our own sensitivities even as we developed a steady burden of resentment against their unknowing offences.</p>
<p>What follows from such buried anger is something that can be mistaken for disinterest but is in substance very different. We no longer want to celebrate their birthday; we withhold sexual attention; we don’t look up when they walk into a room. This could seem like the normal impact of time and proximity, but it is no such thing. It is evidence of cold fury. We do our anger an honour, and can start to dismantle its deleterious effects, when we recognise the full impact of unexamined frustration on our emotions. We never simply go off people; we only ever get very angry with them. And then forget we are so.</p>
<p>To refind our instinctive enthusiasm for our partner, we need to accurately locate our suppressed distress. We have to allow ourselves to be legitimately upset about certain things that have saddened us and properly raise them – for as long as we need to – in a way that lets us feel acknowledged and valued. Because anger inflicts an ever-increasing toll the longer it is left unaddressed, a good couple should allow for regular occasions when each person can – without encountering opposition – ask the other to listen to incidents, large or small, in which they felt let down of late. There might be an evening a week left free for this form of ‘processing’. The mission should be bluntly known to both parties: an opportunity to pick up on areas in which we feel let down – not, one should add, in the name of killing love, but in the name of ensuring its ongoing buoyancy. It goes without saying that we might not immediately see why a given thing should matter so much to our partner, but that wouldn’t be the point. The objective of the exercise would never be to listen to complaints that seemed utterly relatable to us, it would be to let the partner know that we cared because these were problems in their minds.</p>
<p>To ensure that our desire never suffers, this kind of hygienic ritual might be placed at the centre of every relationship. If couples too often ignore the requirement, it is because they operate under an unfair burden of bravery: they are far more susceptible than they let themselves think. They assume that it cannot be sane to get ‘upset’ so often, to experience so much hurt, to be so easily ruffled. They can’t summon the courage to make a complaint about things that they don’t even admit to themselves have caused a sting – and so they stay silent until it is no longer possible for them to feel.</p>
<p>Wiser couples know that nothing should ever be too small to cover at length – for what is ultimately at stake in a marathon conversation about a single word or a miniscule event in the hallway can be the fate of the entire relationship. These lovers are in this sense like wise parents who, when a child is sorrowful, are patient enough to enter into the imaginative realm of the child and take the time to find out just how upsetting it was that the felt-tip pen smudged the top of the drawing of the daffodil, or that their teddy bear ‘Nounou’ didn’t get to eat ‘lunch’ at nursery. It might, in a similar spirit, not be silly at all to devote three and a quarter hours to understanding why a partner got silently immensely upset by the way we said the word ‘ready’ to them at breakfast the day before, or how it felt to them when we were a touch slow at laughing along with a mildly unfunny story they shared about a train and a suitcase at dinner with our aunt. The gratitude that will flow from such an effort to understand them will be amply repaid the next time we feel abandoned because they forgot to put the lid back on the olives or omitted to add a second ‘x’ at the end of an email.</p>
<p>To complain in love is a noble and honourable skill very far removed from the category of whininess with which it is sometimes confused. The irony of well-targeted and quickly raised complaints is that their function is entirely positive. Honesty is a love-preserving mechanism that keeps alive all that is impressive and delightful about our partner in our eyes. By regularly voicing our small sorrows and minor irritations, we are scraping the barnacles off the keel of our relationship and thereby ensuring that we will sail on with continued joy and admiration into an authentic and unresentful future.</p>
