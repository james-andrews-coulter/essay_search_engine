            <h3>¶ Specialisation</h3>
<p>The modern economy demands, and rewards, specialisation. The reason why was first elaborated at the end of the 18th century by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. In The Wealth of Nations (1776), Smith explained how specialisation – what he termed the ‘division of labour’ – decisively increases collective productivity. In a society where everyone does everything, only a small number of shoes, houses, nails, bushels of wheat, horse bridles and cart wheels are ever produced, as no one ends up especially good or efficient at producing anything. But if people specialise in just one small area (making rivets, shaping spokes, manufacturing rope, bricklaying, etc.), they become much faster and more efficient and the overall level of production is greatly increased. By focusing our efforts, our societies grow wealthier and better supplied with the goods they need. It is a tribute to the world Smith foresaw that we have ended up with highly specialised job titles such as Senior Packaging &amp; Branding Designer, Intake and Triage Clinician, Research Centre Manager, Risk and Internal Audit Controller and Transport Policy Consultant – in other words, tiny cogs in giant efficient machines.</p>
<p>Despite all this, we are at grave risk of getting bored. Deep in our hearts, most of us long to be wide-ranging, endlessly curious generalists. We can understand the origins of this restlessness when we look at childhood. As children, we were allowed to do so much. In a single Saturday morning, we might put on an extra jumper and imagine being an Arctic explorer, then have brief stints as an architect making a Lego house, a rock star making up an anthem about cornflakes and an inventor working out how to speed up colouring-in by gluing four felt-tip pens together. We’d put in a few minutes as a member of an emergency rescue team, then we’d try out being a pilot brilliantly landing a cargo plane on the rug in the corridor; we’d perform a life-saving operation on a knitted rabbit, and finally we’d find employment as a sous-chef helping to make a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch.</p>
<p>Each one of these ‘games’ might have been the beginning of a career, yet we had to settle on only a single option, done repeatedly over fifty years. We are so much more than the world of work ever allows us to be. We have chosen to make work pay more rather than be more interesting. It’s a sombre thought, but a consoling one too. Our suffering is painful but has a curious dignity to it, because it does not uniquely affect us as individuals. It applies as much to the CEO as to the intern, to the artist as much as to the accountant. Everyone could have found so many versions of happiness that will elude them. In suffering in this way, we are participating in the common human lot. Whatever we do, parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and die without having had the chance to come to full maturity – for the sake of the genuine benefits of focus and specialisation.</p>
