            <h1>Some Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>I have tried in this book to offer some productive ways to think about adversity in four different contexts. In these few final comments I should like to draw out and make
  explicit one or two general points that I see running through the discussions. In doing so, I offer a couple of further suggestions for thinking about adversity.</p>
<p>Scepticism</p>
<p>It is important, I think, if you want to make sense of the adversity in your life to seek to be sceptical. This means a number of things. In part it is a matter of acknowledging
  that there are many things you do not know – far more than you do know – about the human condition. Life is deeply mysterious, and the motives that human beings have for doing what they
  do are often deeply obscure to everyone, including the individual concerned. Do not fight this mystery; seek to live it. Try to give others, and yourself, the benefit of the doubt. Judge,
  if at all, coolly and after reflection.</p>
<p>Being sceptical is also a matter of your relation to what you do believe. You can hold your opinions in a kind of tentative fashion. The truth is that the position we tend to adopt automatically
  when we have an opinion is that we know. Hence the Franco-Romanian philosopher E. M. Cioran said in his book A Short History of Decay that ‘man is the dogmatic being par
  excellence’ (Précis de décomposition: 88). The advantage of being sceptical is that it helps to undercut adversity, both in oneself and with others. As Cioran points
  out, history is a scene of such relentless suffering inflicted by human beings on themselves and on each other because – or, at any rate, largely because – there have been endless
  individuals who were sure they knew the truth and sought to get others to agree with them. For those who feel sure they have the answers are usually pretty keen to impose them on others. I would
  add to this the point I made in the Introduction, that human beings are ontological misfits: the claim that one knows the truth is invariably an attempt to conceal from oneself one’s
  ontological insecurity, by making it seem that one has the stability of truth – that one is not insecure after all. If we were at home in the world we would not experience or create adversity
  as we do.</p>
<p>And it is not only at the large, historical level that scepticism might be helpful. In interpersonal relationships scepticism helps to reduce adversity, because it means that one is much more
  willing to be open to the other’s point of view. It can help also with the attainment of individual inner peace, since it encourages a kind of cheerful tolerance in the face of
  disagreement.</p>
<p>Of course, it is immensely hard to put such scepticism into practice. But if you can mobilize it in yourself, even only occasionally or haltingly, you will have done much to reduce the incidence
  of adversity in your life.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>So do not fight your vulnerability, your weakness. Meditate on it and seek to incorporate it consciously in your life. Ancient thinkers such as Marcus Aurelius and
  Seneca recommended that, in order to cope with life’s adversities, we should practise for them in advance, through thought experiments. The key is to acknowledge that bad things will happen
  to you because that is just the way life is, and to meditate on them, so that if and when they arrive you will be able to cope better. Hence Seneca writes:</p>
<p>For by looking ahead to all [the bad] that may happen as though it were going to happen, [you] . . . will soften the attacks of all ills, which bring nothing unforeseen to
      those who are prepared and expectant, but come as a serious blow to those who . . . expect only blessings. (‘On the Tranquillity of the Mind’: 130)</p>
<p>Imagine yourself in various situations of adversity and ask yourself how you could most constructively react in them, to them. If you do this, you will have a good chance of
  coming somewhat more prepared to them and may make less of a mess of them than you otherwise would, because you will have acknowledged your weakness from the first.] I also find it helpful
  sometimes to imagine that a wise and generous but rigorous person is accompanying me through the day. Montaigne is my favourite, because he is so phenomenally well-balanced. And when I am about to
  get angry or frustrated, I imagine what he would say to me, and I invariably find that this helps to put my feelings into perspective and allows me to get a grip on them and remain calmer.
  Thinking, too, about how self-indulgent it is to get worked up about some small issue, as I sometimes do, in a world ‘bursting with sin and sorrow’, as Johnson put it, and in which I
  have been spared the worst forms of suffering that have taken place and are taking place right now, also helps, I find.</p>
<p>Pleasure</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is this: cope with adversity by seeking out those things in life that give you pleasure and a sense of peace. Seneca advises us to go for walks, to
  drink wine, and in general to show kindness to ourselves – for it is surprising how hard it often is to be kind to oneself. Montaigne too advises this. Nietzsche as well, who tells us we
  should think each morning of something pleasant we can do during the day, not least to help us deal successfully with any adversity we may encounter. It is important to be rigorously realistic with
  oneself, but it is also important to find good things in life. And Montaigne suggests, in his essay ‘On diversion’, that, if we are assailed by painful or difficult thoughts, we should
  divert the mind:</p>
<p>[S]ome distressing idea gets hold of me; I find it quicker to change it than to subdue it. If I cannot replace it with an opposite one, I find at least a different one.
      Change is always a solace, dissolves the idea and dispels it. If I cannot fight it, I flee it. (‘De la diversion’: 51)</p>
<p>One can do this for others too. Montaigne tells us that he once had to console a lady who was feeling distressed. Instead of seeking to show her that her distress was not
  justified and directly confronting her suffering, he spoke to her about her feelings and then gradually took the conversation away to other things. And, he says, ‘I kept her composed and
  totally calm as long as I was there’ (‘De la diversion’: 47).</p>
<p>Urbanity</p>
<p>I think we might sum up these thoughts by invoking the notion of urbanity. For to be urbane is, in one of its aspects, to be able to laugh ironically and good-heartedly at human
  foolishness, including one’s own. Seneca makes this point when he reminds us that we all get moments in which we are filled with hatred or disgust for the human race. Or, as G. K. Chesterton
  has it: ‘Every man has hated humanity . . . Every man has had humanity in his nostrils like a suffocating smell’ (Heretics: 185). And Seneca’s advice is that we should,
  when in this mood, try to find human beings not hateful but ludicrous.</p>
<p>Another way to express this would be to remind ourselves of the wonderful comment by Chremes, a character in The Self-Tormentor, one of the plays of the Roman playwright Terence –
  it was actually one of the classical quotations that Montaigne had inscribed on a beam in his study: ‘I am a human being and I consider nothing human alien to me’.</p>
<p>Running through this book have been two key ideas. Firstly, I have wanted to bring out the way in which forms of adversity – ambivalence, incomprehension, vulnerability and dissolution
  – are also things for which we can be grateful. We could not become adults without experiencing feelings of ambivalence, so they are to be welcomed on that account; we would not find
  anyone erotically appealing if we fully understood him or her, and to that extent incomprehension is valuable; we could not enjoy the delights of the body, unless we could also fall ill, and so we
  have reason to cherish our vulnerability; and we would find little or no meaning in our lives if we were immortal, and so our dissolution, the process of dying that is with us all our lives and
  finally ends in our death, is not wholly an unwelcome intruder into our lives. As Hume writes:</p>
<p>Good and ill are universally intermingled and confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is purely and entirely of a piece. All advantages
      are attended with disadvantages. An universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence. And it is not possible for us, by our most chimerical wishes, to form the idea of a
      station or situation altogether desirable. (Dialogues and Natural History of Religion: 183)</p>
<p>Adversity is inevitable. We must accept that, and not fight or regret it all the time. We should also remember that it can bring good things.</p>
<p>The second key idea in this book, related to the first, is that not despite but on account of all the mistakes you have made in your life, and not despite but because of all the forms of
  adversity that you have experienced and had to cope with, have confronted well or made a mess of, the life you have lived and are living has given you a unique insight into your condition and the
  human condition more generally. The adversity in your life has been a precious source of enlightenment. You will face more adversity. As you do, you should seek not simply to cope with it as
  constructively as possible, turning it to account, but also remember that it is giving you an understanding of things that is irreplaceably valuable. It is part of your inheritance as a human being
  – and you should seek not to consider it alien to you.</p>
