        <h3>On friendliness to strangers</h3>
<p>Many of us, even the very kind ones, have a habit of walking through the world wearing a distinctly uncongenial and surly expression. If someone secretly photographed us on our way to the station or back from the shops, we might wince at our appearance: how stern our resting face is; how guarded we look; how misanthropic we seem. This could pain us in part because we know this is not the whole story. Our outward manner is at odds with a warmer, kinder, more vulnerable and sociable self that we know also exists and that seeks – largely in vain and often rather clumsily – to find expression. We are curmudgeons who harbour thwarted longings for new friendships.</p>
<p>However, it should not be surprising that we have ended up so walled off and uninclined to share ourselves with strangers. Without realising it, we have been given long training in our attitudes. We have been told a lot about the world outside our insulated, predictable routines. We know that the stranger is, as a rule, pretty dangerous, has little to teach us, is likely to be sinister and may well be demented. Admittedly, we have generally not done our own research; we have let others find out for us. On this score, the media’s conclusions are refreshed on our screens every hour of every day: others are to be feared; the unknown is to be avoided; the world (outside our close-knit circle) is mad.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that, despite the surface evidence, strangers are always likely to resemble someone we already know well: us. Beneath the unfamiliar exterior, the distinctive accent, the alien occupation, the unexplored age or social bracket, the stranger is often merely a version of ourselves, the same essential human matter squeezed through a slightly different social and psychological mould:</p>
<p>• The stranger is pained by regrets.</p>
<p>• The stranger is wracked by longings.</p>
<p>• The stranger, despite their impassive appearance, craves love and fellowship.</p>
<p>• The stranger is lonely.</p>
<p>• The stranger loves to laugh, but hasn’t been silly and playful in a long time.</p>
<p>• The stranger was once a baby.</p>
<p>• The stranger might want to say hello.</p>
<p>The places where we most often see strangers – crowded shopping streets, airless subway carriages, airport concourses – tend not to lend plausibility to the above suggestions; they reinforce a message that others must be unfathomable and eerie. Yet feeling at home in the world relies to some extent on going beyond or to the side of the available evidence, refusing to be cowed by surface details and insisting on a theoretical capacity to locate the humanity of all beneath the outer casing.</p>
<p>This is the trick of that guileless artist of the everyday we call the friendly person. They take an attitude of basic goodwill out into unknown spaces. They assume that the stranger will be open to a smile, a reflection on the season, a supportive glance or an unobtrusive greeting. They will suspect that beneath a surly manner, the assistant might be aching to share something of themselves; that, even when there are only a few minutes available, it will be possible to say something heart-warming to a colleague or an official; that one can empathise across the barriers of age, class and profession.</p>
<p>Shyness has its insightful dimensions: it is infused with an awareness that we might be bothering someone with our presence; it is based upon an acute sense that a stranger could be dissatisfied or discomfited by us. The shy person is touchingly alive to the dangers of being a nuisance. Someone with no capacity for shyness is a scary possibility; they operate with a dismaying attitude of entitlement. They are friendly only because they haven’t considered the possibility that the other person might have a disenchanted view of them.</p>
<p>However, we often pay a heavy price for our reserve around people who might have opened their hearts to us, if only we had known how to manifest our own benevolence. We cling too jealously to our province. The pimply boy doesn’t discover that he and the high school beauty share a taste in humour and similarly painful relationships with their fathers; the middle-aged lawyer never unearths a shared love of rockets with the neighbour’s eight-year-old son. Races and ages continue not to mingle, to their collective detriments. Shyness is a touching yet ultimately excessive and unwarranted way of feeling unique.</p>

<p>Guessing what might be going on in the hearts of strangers is a fundamental move of the artist. Without being able to know for sure, these characters bravely and beautifully presume that they might know a key secret bit of you – because they know the key secret bits of themselves. The American poet E.E. Cummings (1894–1962) didn’t wait to be introduced and didn’t worry about all the ways in which you and he were not going to be identical. He assumed that you would understand one or two important things – and he more or less got it right, which is why his poem ‘since feeling is first’ (1926) continues to resonate:</p>
<p>since feeling is first</p>
<p>who pays any attention</p>
<p>to the syntax of things</p>
<p>will never wholly kiss you;</p>
<p>wholly to be a fool</p>
<p>while Spring is in the world</p>
<p>Cummings’ talent was a species of confidence; a way of imagining a commonality between your deep self and his.</p>
<p>With some of that same confidence, we should dare more often to guess at the contents of the hearts of strangers. Without being presumptuous, we might offer a new person some of the reassurance we long for. We might show them a vulnerable part of ourselves; we could express warmth and curiosity; we might go out into the world and share a few tentative thoughts with a stranger and trust that they might one day be a friend.</p>
