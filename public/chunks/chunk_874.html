        <h2>Attachment Theory</h2>
<p>It’s a remarkable testament to the utility of psychoanalysis that a knowledge of one of its central ideas – attachment theory – has become an indispensable requirement for anyone trying to have a relationship. A piece of intellectual argument first devised in a utilitarian child and adolescent clinic in North London in the 1950s by a modest genius of psychology, John Bowlby, has gone on to provide the explanatory motor for almost every relationship in the world. To be able to say to a partner what one’s attachment style is – and to hear theirs in return – and to work out what the consequences of this will be is, quite literally, the central solution to many of the tensions and agonies of love.</p>
<p>Attachment theory suggests that all of us have an attachment ‘style’ in adult love based on the way we were loved as children. There are three main varieties of attachment – and we should, before we go anywhere near a first date, be sure to have a pretty good grasp of which direction we lean in.</p>
<p>The first and most balanced category is known as secure attachment. Here we are able to trust in love and not unduly panic whenever problems occur, as they inevitably do – because we have all across our childhoods known the safe, comforting love of a sane adult who was reliable, steady and full of tolerance and patience. If we are secure in adulthood and someone says something frustrating or puzzling, we don’t immediately snap back, throw something at them or withdraw. We get curious, we remain sure of our legitimate need for love and of the likelihood that our partner remains, deep down, kind and good; there is simply some misunderstanding, which we can clear up with humour and goodwill over time (there is no hurry).</p>
<p>The second, far more tragic, characteristic way of bonding to others is known as anxious attachment. Here we react like the panicky infants we once were to any sign that our partner is not delivering the utterly secure and intense love we so badly need – in compensation for the turbulent childhood we suffered, in which our needs were not respected and our cravings for love not honoured. We may, as anxious lovers, accuse our partner of being a bad person, shout angrily at them or try to control them into submission. At the slightest sign of a problem, we immediately give up on a sense that our partner might be benevolent and simply respond with fury and destructiveness to our underlying alarm. Again, we have been primed by childhood to expect the very worst – and thereby, in a terrible confirmation of our worst fears, tend actually to bring this about.</p>
<p>The third, equally awful kind of attachment is known as avoidant attachment, whereby we respond to a perceived threat in love by going entirely cold, withdrawing and ensuring that we aren’t exposed for a second to what we imagine is the catastrophe of loving without being adequately loved back. The irony here, too, is that avoidant people bring about the very problem they are seeking to escape. In response to their coldness and terseness, their emotional chill and distance, the most well-meaning partner may end up responding by doing exactly what the avoidant person fears: going away.</p>
<p>How, then, will knowing attachment theory help? At the most basic level, it will help us to know what to do with puzzling or difficult behaviour in others – but also, as importantly, in ourselves. It will give us a vocabulary in which to own up to our madness and be tolerant towards the madness in others. It should open up a space for humour between a couple, in which their mutual insanities can be reflected upon, forgiven and negotiated around.</p>
<p>If we are faced by someone who is shouting at us and telling us we’re a useless, bad person, we might think – if we had just arrived from another planet or were a young person starting out in love – that was a sure sign that someone really didn’t like us at all and that we should make an exit fast. But attachment theory urges us to adopt a wiser, very different line. This probably isn’t in fact any such sign. It’s simply evidence that we’re dealing with someone who has real difficulty, because of their childhood, telling us that they love us and yet are hurt. It’s too risky and exposed for them to do this and that’s why they are calling us a shit, not because they hate us, but because it feels intolerable to re-encounter in adulthood a kind of disappointment that evokes a searing childhood let-down.</p>
<p>Equally, attachment theory warns us what to do if we start to sense a sudden drop in affection in our partner. We might surmise that this was a sign that they have gone off us – and leave accordingly. But we should first do something a little more complicated. We need to ask ourselves: Might I have inadvertently hurt this person and they are not telling me, because they are the victim of a childhood that has left them badly unable to trust that they can dare to make a successful complaint against someone who has slighted them? We are dealing with a sort of person who will go cold and silent faster than they will explain and never give their partner a chance to repair the damage out in the open. It’s brutal and sad, but a lot less sad than them actually having gone off us. They are cold because they love us, and because that love feels so exposing and risky to them. This kind of person might even – in extremis – slip off and have an affair with someone else – again, not because they hate us, but because we have (probably inadvertently) hurt them, and they never, ever want to be in a position of being hurt without some escape route open to them. Though we think we know what an affair is, there is simply no comparing an affair entered into because of a genuine disinterest in someone with an affair entered into by an avoidant person. One is moving away because they don’t love you; the other is moving away because it feels to them that they love you too much in a substantially unrequited way – and the insecurity of doing so has reached a monstrous pitch.</p>
<p>At the same time, attachment theory can give us a clue as to how to behave with our own psyches. If we sense ourselves going cold with a partner, we should think not about how much we dislike them, but about whether or not they have hurt us at some earlier point we can’t bear to think about. We’re very likely to have gone off them not because they are suddenly awful but because they have damaged our very fragile ability to trust, and we have responded by withdrawing as we learnt to do during our difficult childhoods.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we often find ourselves losing our temper with our partner and throwing all sorts of accusations at them, we should imagine that we aren’t merely dictatorial and enraged, we are very scared and that this is why we have become so unpleasant. More importantly, if we can explain this to our partner, they will see that what they have on their hands is not a monster but a very frightened child – which makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Not all relationships deserve to survive, but it’s especially tragic that so many of them end because of problems that can so clearly be traced back to difficulties created by unknown attachment issues. We owe it to ourselves, before we leave any relationship, to explore whether what may be driving us out is not a lack of love but a love that feels too frightening, given what our childhoods have taught us about what happens when we need to be loved and soothed. By knowing about attachment theory, we have a chance to break free from the patterns of the past and learn to overcome inevitable but often innocent moments when our partner’s love does not seem as solid and unambiguous as we need it to be.</p>
