        <h2>XV: THE ARGUMENT IN PARADISE</h2>
<p>We’re in paradise: a beachfront hotel on a tropical island, a charming cottage in a tranquil valley, a luxurious hotel in a historic city. Our spirits stand to be soothed by beauty and comfort. We’ve argued in the stressed, imperfect circumstances of home, but now we are free to be sweet, calm, thoughtful, tender and patient. We have come here quite deliberately to give ourselves a pleasant break and to restore our better feelings towards one another.</p>
<p>Yet it can be precisely in idyllic surroundings that we get especially irritated and frustrated with one another, and where some of our most explosive and bitter arguments may, ironically, be played out against a backdrop of quiet meadows and turquoise seas.</p>
<p>It seems especially aberrant and awful that this should happen when our cultural assumptions have no space for the strange shouting matches, brittle stand-offs and brutal confrontations that have followed us to paradise.</p>
<p>But there’s a reasonable logic at work nevertheless: Because everything outward is particularly nice, the unhappy parts of our minds become more conspicuous. Our distresses weigh on us more heavily and announce themselves unusually loudly when bliss is demanded. Our high hopes of contentment make our frustrations with our partner (and secretly also with ourselves) even harder to accept. If only it weren’t for them …</p>
<p>By contrast, it is sometimes our exposure to grim realities – to bleak stories of war, to tragedies and misfortune or to places where nature is hostile (a barren desert; a cold, craggy, storm-swept island) – that make our inner distress feel less important or pressing. We’re more inclined to overlook our partner’s annoying details in situations where having anyone at all feels like a privilege and where the entire human project seems fundamentally precarious and cursed.</p>
<p>Yet we should not compound our misery by declaring it illegitimate. We should mock our naive starting assumption that money and physical displacement could solve the problems that bedevil our scratchy partnerships, and accept that beautiful surroundings are only ever one ingredient – and certainly not the most powerful – to affect our lives. The capacity of great linen and succulent buffets to lift our mood is negligible as compared with the influence of honest communication or an opportunity to work through our resentments. Our beautiful hotels teach us quiet lessons in the secondary importance of material goods.</p>
<p>But we should also skewer the fear that paradise must forever be marred by a few bust-ups. After the fight in the beachside bungalow or the flaming argument in the taverna, we will know that we have gloriously failed the challenge of living up to our surroundings and being a decent, mature person – and we will be all the better and more liberated for it. Of course we can’t be totally happy or grown up for more than a few hours; this is simply how all humans are built (we just don’t know enough about the lives of strangers to trust that we aren’t the freakish exceptions). We haven’t surrendered our right to be sad and vile just because we’re paying a small fortune for a bed for the night and there’s a beautiful view out on the bay. The privileges of true paradise include the right to be, at points, just as miserable and fractious as we need to be.</p>
