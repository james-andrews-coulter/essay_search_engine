        <h1>The Jack Story</h1>
<p>The deserts of America are lonely places; miles can go by without any other cars or a single house. In one of these wildernesses a driver heard his tyre blow. He was more annoyed than worried, knowing that he kept a spare tyre and a jack in his car boot. Then he remembered; he got the jack out last week and forgot to put it back. He had no jack. But things could be worse, because he passed a garage about three miles back. As he started walking, he talked to himself: ‘There aren’t any other garages around here. I’m at the garage man’s mercy. He could really rip me off just for lending me a jack. He could charge me what he wanted. He could charge $50. There is nothing I could do about it. Goddamn, he could even charge $150. People are terrible to take advantage of others like that. Hell, what bastards people are.’ He continued absentmindedly telling himself this story until he got to the garage. The attendant came out and said in a friendly way, ‘How can I help you?’ and the traveller said, ‘You can take your damned jack and you can stuff it.’24</p>
<p>We can be unaware of the tales we regularly tell ourselves and even unaware of their effect on us. We act on fantasies as though they are realities. And when we visualize something it can happen, because – whether or not we are aware of our fantasies – that is what we expect to happen. We have all heard of people who would really like to have a life partner but tell themselves they cannot trust potential mates. Towards the potential partner they act as though he or she is not to be trusted, and keep testing them: Would they stay with me if I was really nasty all the time? They do not mean to do this; they do it because of the story they tell themselves about what others are. Self-fulfilling prophecies are just that: they come true.</p>
<p>Much of the story we tell ourselves goes back to the dynamics of our family of origin. We get fixed in a story like our fellow without a jack and his belief that man always takes advantage of his fellow man. Therefore we need to be self-aware. What stories are we telling ourselves about other people? What dynamic do our stories suck us into, and how do they determine the meanings we put on things and how we define them? We all like to think we keep an open mind and can change our opinions in the light of new evidence, but most of us seem to be geared to making up our minds very quickly. Then we process further evidence not with an open mind but with a filter, only acknowledging the evidence that backs up our original impression. It is too easy for us to fall into the trap of believing that being right is more important than being open to what might be.</p>
<p>If we practise detachment from our thoughts we learn to observe them as though we are taking a bird’s eye view of our own thinking. When we do this, we might find that our thinking belongs to an older, and different, story to the one we are now living. For instance, we might be someone like Martin.</p>
<p>Martin always needs an enemy. In every story he tells, there is him and a ‘baddie’ of some sort. If you hear just one of his stories you might think, ‘What a good thing Martin is crusading against such wickedness, be it a corrupt mayor, a political cause, non-paying customer or other scoundrel.’ But then you begin to see that every tale features Martin, the crusading hero, against a ‘baddie’. The plots of his tales are complex and involve the amassing of evidence on Martin’s part. It is amassed through a filter, because once Martin has made up his mind about something, he looks for evidence that backs up his position, and no longer sees anything else. Polarized against the ‘baddies’ are the ‘goodies’: if you get into Martin’s good books you can do no wrong – his judgement of you will always be positive. When you first get to know him, you may not notice anything amiss, but after a while you may recognize the same patterns reccurring. It seems like the dynamic is already set in Martin’s head, and the people around him are simply fulfilling the pre-existing roles he has available. Thus he replays the dynamics of his childhood over and over again. We tend to do the same.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to understand our past. Contemplation, psychotherapy or an exercise like the genogram (which I will describe in more detail later on) can help us do this. Our dynamic is also wrapped up in the stories we tell, the tales we hear and our background fantasies. All this contributes to the meanings we make that shape our behaviour.</p>
<p>A dynamic such as Martin’s is usually formed by his childhood experience. Perhaps one or both of his parents had the same dynamic and therefore the same filter through which they viewed the world. Or perhaps Martin’s experience was of huge injustice; for example, not being believed when he was telling the truth, or being punished when he was innocent. These grievances fester in the unconscious as: ‘I was right; they were wrong.’ Indeed ‘they’ were so wrong that Martin needs to keep finding ‘them’ and proving them wrong. He needs to feel himself in the right and be seen to be right, over and over again. So he searches out the enemies and wrongdoers he needs to regulate his own emotions and thus feel okay. He needs an enemy to be ‘wrong’ so he can feel ‘right’. If he sticks to his dynamic unquestioningly he will not develop or learn and the ghosts and stories of his past will prevent him having true contact with people in the present. He will compromise all his relationships.</p>
<p>There are many dynamics that are passed down by previous generations or established by childhood adaptations to an environment that the individual no longer inhabits. An example is our attitude to money: we may be striving for money at the expense of our relationships, or believe we have less or more than we actually do. Money is often a metaphor for how secure we feel in our relationships. For example: if we cannot face up to our fear of losing love, we displace that fear by reiterating reasons to be mean with our money.</p>
<p>Then there are our attitudes to place. If we are always moving, never satisfied with this town or that house, this country or that continent, and come up with brilliant reasons as to why we need to move again, the solution is probably to be found in our own psyche, rather than in the geography of a particular place or the ways of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>There are any number of examples I could come up with to illustrate stuck patterns of thinking, reacting and doing, to show how we use reason to prevent us from discovering more about our feelings. We need to look at the repetitions in the stories we tell ourselves about other people – at the process of the stories rather than merely their surface content. Then we can begin to experiment with changing the filter through which we look at the world, start to edit the story and thus regain flexibility where we have been getting stuck.</p>
<p>In my personal therapy I uncovered many such stories and was able to trace the origins of some of them. When exploring my patterns for acting in groups, I used an exercise called the genogram. A genogram is an elaborate family tree, which traces not only blood lines, but lines of behaving, relating, character traits and attitudes. I have explained how to create a genogram in the exercise section at the back of this book. Looking at my genogram I saw that both of my parents come from large families. Then there was something I had not noticed before, which became obvious once it was on paper in front of me: both of my parents had a sibling to whom they were apparently less close than to their other siblings. Both of my parents also idolized one of their own parents.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the way I myself behaved in group situations. In psychotherapy training you usually belong to many groups: your main training group, plus different groups for different modules of the training. I noticed that I always idealized one member of each group and felt annoyed by or dismissive of another. It came as a revelation to me that this pattern was repeated in all my groups, and it dawned on me as I worked with my genogram that I had a pattern for behaving in these group situations that might be embedded in the past rather than be a response to the given situation in the present.</p>
<p>Once I discovered this I had more choice about how to act. Rather than letting that behaviour continue automatically, I resolved to observe the impulses I had to admire one person and demonize another. If I found myself demonizing a person I practised focusing on what was positive about them. By doing this I changed my negative filter for a positive one. Sometimes it is necessary to over-steer in the opposite direction for a while, in order to find your true trajectory.</p>
<p>The next group I engaged with was an interview panel for a new job. I had applied for my first job as a therapist, at a centre for recovering drug and alcohol addicts, where I would have to run therapy groups. The interviewer asked me what my group style was. I told them how I had traditionally behaved in group situations and I expected it to cost me the job. However, I did get it. I told them I was surprised, considering I had revealed my habit of favouritizing and demonizing in groups. The supervisor told me that it was because I was aware of this impulse that she had faith that I would not act on it, and that is why they considered me a safe group leader. After that trust was shown towards me,25 I did not act on my old impulse, even though I still felt its pull. I was able to do that because I had learnt to stop and observe my instincts, rather than unthinkingly going along with them. In this way I changed the story of how I act in groups.</p>
<p>As I have said previously, sometimes a new behaviour feels false or unreal but is merely unfamiliar. In my experience what ‘feels’ true might not actually be the truth, or good for us; it might merely be familiar. And, conversely, what feels ‘false’ might not be; it might just be new. I can sometimes still feel a compelling impulse to demonize and idolize members of a group, and if I give in to it, it feels temporarily satisfying. It takes willpower and practice to be aware that I feel the impulse; it feels more comfortable to ignore it. But, gradually, resisting those impulses becomes my nature too. I can free myself from an old dynamic. I can let neural pathways laid down in my childhood relationships grow over, and I can forge new paths over uncharted territory, paths that serve me, the people around me, and possibly the world, more advantageously. Although we are always in danger of reverting to old unsatisfactory patterns, especially in times of stress, new behaviour can become automatic too, and loses its ‘phoney’ feel.</p>
<p>Each of us comes from a mother and a father, or from a sperm bank, and each of us was brought up by our parents or by people standing in for them. Many of us have siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins. All of these people have an impact on who we are, as do their ancestors. Those ancestors, too, had problems and triumphs, and any learning or habits these experiences gave them they tended to pass down. Red hair or skin tone are easily spotted as inherited characteristics, and it’s not difficult to spot, for instance, an inherited aesthetic taste. Using the genogram we can see how we form and keep (or do not keep) relationships, how we act in groups, how we make decisions and use thought and emotions, and generally find our place in the world. In the genogram these inherited characteristics are as obvious as hair-colour or sense of taste. The point of the exercise is to free you up to make more appropriate choices, so that it is YOU who is making the choices that affect you, and not your great-grandparents. You may feel it is ridiculous to think that your ancestors are influencing you now, but part of who we are derives from previous generations, in ways that can be either productive or unproductive. You can find exact instructions for the genogram exercise at the end of the book.</p>
<p>Through the millennia, stories, songs and rituals have been passed down by the elders to the young of our tribes. Some of the stories and their meanings get lost. I wonder what else is lost with them? In an age of 24/7 news we tend to be all-consumed with the stories of the here and now; the ever unfolding crises and negative things happening in the world. Do our elders still want to tell their stories? Do we still know how to listen if they do? And if we do not, what are we hearing instead?</p>
<p>I am going to finish with a couple of stories that illustrate, first, how change can come about through dialogue and, second, how wisdom is passed from one generation to another.</p>
<p>Die Meistersinger: The Master Singers</p>
<p>Die Meistersinger von Nürnburg is an opera by Wagner. It is a story about a singing competition. The Meistersinger (‘master singers’) is a guild-like institution that runs the competition according to strict, pedantic, unbending rules that provide structure and discipline but stifle creativity and joy. Enter Walther the romantic genius, whose chaos injects brilliance, originality, passion, artistic integrity, erotic feeling and, unfortunately, a riot into the proceedings. Here we have the two elements of life we must steer between: rigidity, represented by the Meistersinger, and chaos, represented by Walther.</p>
<p>The hero of the opera is Hans Sachs, a cobbler, who persuades the Meistersinger that rules are only useful if they are flexible and applied when real need arises. Sachs listens to both sides, appreciates their opposing points of view and engages them in dialogue. He is a learned and thoughtful man who understands the need to steer a course between chaos and rigidity. We see him pondering man’s illusions and the madness of human existence and wondering how to apply philosophy to the problem of getting the Meistersinger to appreciate Walther’s merits and Walther to see the necessity of some rules to preserve the history and story of their country. Thanks to his thoughtful, reflective and flexible thinking and his wisdom, all ends well. Only one of the Meistersinger, Beckmesser, remains unconvinced and unchanging. Beckmesser is tripped up by his own self-interest. He tries to cheat and ends up isolated and unhappy. Sachs, unlike Beckmesser, understands that there is no shortcut to flexibility; it demands integrity, hard work and close attention. Our job is like Sachs’s. We too, have to negotiate that line between rigidity and chaos.</p>
<p>My Wooden Spoon</p>
<p>I sometimes look at a busy street and think: in a hundred years, we will all be dead. On this same street a hundred years ago, perhaps another woman thought the same thing. Perhaps, however, like me, she consoled herself with the thought that love is generative and lives on in the next generation, passed on in the habits of love we inculcate in our pupils, children and friends. I have my late aunt’s paintings around me, my late mother’s ring on my finger and her words inside me still urging me to tell my daughter to ‘be careful’ every time she leaves the house. My grandfather’s gruff sarcasm lives on in my father and in me, so he is not really dead. When my daughter lays out a sewing pattern, my fondness for needlework lives on in her.</p>
<p>This deeply moving process, that connects human to human in a cascade of memory passing through generations, can be symbolized by particular objects that are passed down along with the knowledge of our ancestors. I am the proud owner of a wooden spoon that is worn into an un-spoon-like stump. In the pre-electric whisk days of the 1960s, my aunt taught me to cream the butter and sugar for a cake mixture; we always used the same spoon. Even then the spoon was worn out. My aunt had, in her turn, used it as a child. I use a whisk now; but the sight of that spoon in the drawer brings tears to my eyes if it catches me unawares on an hormonal day. My aunt will be forgotten eventually; my daughter may not talk about her to her children; but I am sure that my daughter will teach her own children how to make cakes. Along with cake recipes she will pass down the love I received first from my aunt. Oh yes, my aunt will live on, even if her name gets mentioned less and less and her spoon is thrown away.</p>
