        <h3>Why, once you understand love,you can love anyone</h3>
<p>Irrespective of whether you consider Jesus to be a popular itinerant preacher or the son of God, there is something very unusual about his views on love. He not only spoke a great deal about love, but also advocated that we love some surprising people.</p>
<p>At one point (described in chapter 7 of Luke’s Gospel), he goes to a dinner party and a local prostitute turns up, much to the disgust of the hosts. But Jesus is friendly and kind and defends her against everyone else’s criticism. In a way that shocks the other guests, he insists that she is a good person at heart.</p>
<p>In another story (in Matthew, chapter 8), Jesus is approached by a man affected with leprosy. He’s in a terrible state. But Jesus isn’t shocked and does not shy away from him; instead he reaches out his hand and touches the man. Despite the man’s horrendous appearance, here is someone (in Jesus’s eyes) that is deserving of closeness and kindness. In a similar vein, at other times, Jesus argues that tax collectors, thieves and adulterers are not to be thought of as outside the circle of love.</p>
<p>Many centuries after Jesus’s death, the medieval thinker Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) defined what Jesus was getting at in this way of talking about love: the person who truly understands love could love anyone. In other words, true love is not specific in its target; it doesn’t fixate on particular qualities; it is open to all of humanity, even (and in a way especially) its less appealing examples.</p>
<p>Today this can sound like a strange notion of what love is, because our background ideas about love tend to be closely tied to a dramatic experience: that of falling in love; that is, finding one very specific person immensely attractive, exciting and free of any failings or drawbacks. Love is, we feel, a response to the overt perfection of another person.</p>
<p>However – via some admittedly extreme examples – a very important aspect of love is pushed to the fore in Jesus’s vision – and we don’t have to be a Christian to benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the heart of this kind of love is an effort to see beyond the outwardly unappealing surface of another human, in search of the tender, interesting, scared and vulnerable person inside.</p>
<p>What we know as the ‘work’ of love is the emotional, imaginative labour that is required to peer behind an off-putting facade. Our minds tend to resist such a move. They follow well-worn grooves that feel at once familiar and justified. For instance, if someone has hurt us, we naturally see them as horrible. The thought that they might themselves be hurting inside feels weird. If a person looks odd, we find it difficult to recognise that there might be many touching things about them deep down.</p>
<p>If unpleasant events happen in someone’s life – if they lose their job, or start drinking too much, or even develop a serious illness – we might be tempted to hold them responsible for their misfortunes. It takes quite a deliberate, taxing effort of the mind to move away from these established responses. To do so might mean taking an unappealing-looking person and trying to imagine them as a young child, joyfully playing on their bedroom floor. We might try to picture their mother, not long after their birth, holding them in their arms, overcome by passionate love for this new little life. Or perhaps drunk and passed out, ignoring their desperate cries.</p>
<p>We might see a furious person in a restaurant violently complaining that the tomato sauce is on the wrong place on their plate, but imagine how unequipped they are to understand, let alone patiently explain their own needs to others, and how powerless they must feel in a world that has frustrated them to the core.</p>
<p>The more energy we expend on thinking like this, the more we stand to discover a very surprising truth: that we could potentially see the loveable aspects of pretty much anyone.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean we should give up all criteria when searching for a partner. It’s a way of saying that the nicest person will eventually require us to look at them with imagination as we try to negotiate around some of their gravely dispiriting facets.</p>
<p>Of course, the traffic isn’t all one way. We too are challenging to be around and therefore in need of a constantly imaginative tender gaze to rescue us from being dismissed as just another everyday monster or leper.</p>
