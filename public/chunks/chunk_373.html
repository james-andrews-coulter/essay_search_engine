            <h4>5. Learn Something by Heart</h4>
<p>This suggestion may come as something of a surprise. What does the tedious, old-fashioned task of rote learning have to do with strengthening your capacity for and enjoyment of
  being alone? Didn’t we break away from that dead educational model decades ago? Now we have the internet, and calculators and mobile phones, why on earth would we want to clog up our brains
  with those repetitive factoids – like times tables, irregular verbs and the dates of the kings of England?</p>
<p>There are a whole series of counterarguments and answers to these sorts of questions, beginning with the observation that there are other richer things to learn by heart – and note all the
  connotations of ‘heart’ here; they include love and rhythm. If you find times tables or historical dates boring, learn something else – poetry, a foreign language, the
  periodic table. But there are two particular answers which relate very closely to the joys of solitude and the fear of being alone: a well-stocked mind enhances creativity, and a mental store of
  beautiful or useful items offers security, frees one from complete dependence on oneself and appears to aid balance and sanity in solitude.</p>
<p>I have already suggested that solitude may be a necessity, and it is certainly a well-established aid to creativity. One reason why this is so is that the social presence of others distracts or
  reconstructs a person’s sense of their core self. So if, seized with inspiration, you need some material for your creative impulse to work on, you will undermine your own project if you have
  to turn outside yourself to grasp the necessary information. Wordsworth’s famous poem ‘Daffodils’ would have a very different effect if it ended:</p>
<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie</p>
<p>In vacant or in pensive mood,</p>
<p>I have to rise and go and search</p>
<p>On Flickr, Google or YouTube.</p>
<p>The capacity to be creative is profoundly linked to the ability to remember: the word ‘remember’ derives from ‘re-member’, to ‘put the parts back
  together’. So strongly was this felt to be the case that classical Greek mythology made Memory ‘the mother of the Muses’.</p>
<p>The Muses were the nine beautiful nymphs, the young women who represented the arts and inspired artists: Calliope (epic poetry); Clio (history); Euterpe (flutes and lyric poetry); Thalia (comedy
  and pastoral poetry); Melpomene (tragedy); Terpsichore (dance); Erato (love poetry); Polyhymnia (sacred poetry); Urania (astronomy). Their father was Zeus, the chief of all the Gods, and their
  mother was Mnemosyne – memory. We still use the word ‘muse’ to describe a woman who is an abiding influence on a male artist.</p>
<p>Children’s memories used to be trained from primary school, but so-called ‘rote learning’ has gone out of fashion. A number of people, including me, think this is a pity. There
  is a good deal to be said in favour of ‘learning by heart’.</p>
<p>The Muses: Nine beautiful nymphs who represented the arts and inspired artists. Their mother was Mnemosyne – memory.</p>
<p>The argument in favour of memorizing ‘scales or times tables or verse’ . . . has been attacked for years now – unfairly . . . Sense and memory are allies
      . . . Rote learning is more like training than learning. It is the trellis on which a free thinker can climb. . . ‘Memorization’ used to be almost a synonym for
      ‘culture’. [Now] it is a party trick . . . a waste of time . . . [Education] ‘can only come from the initial submission of the student’s mind to the body of knowledge
      contained within specific subjects.’. . . In education, submission is empowerment.</p>
<p>(Christopher Caldwell, Financial Times, 16 November 2012)</p>
<p>What we have memorized, learned by heart, we have internalized in a very special way. The knowledge is now part of our core self, our identity, and we can access it when we are
  alone: we are no longer an isolated fragment drifting in a huge void, but linked through these shared shards of culture to a larger richer world, but without losing our ‘aloneness’. For
  many people this resource, this well-stocked mental larder, offers food for thought, for coherence, for security, and must be one of the factors that turns ‘isolation’ into creative
  solitude. This is a kind of cultural engagement that you cannot get from the web or from reading.</p>
<p>Another benefit of having a rich and multilayered collection of memorized material ready to hand, as it were, is more anecdotal. Solitary confinement, especially if accompanied by fear,
  uncertainty or sensory deprivation, really does induce psychosis and lead to the breakdown of even apparently tough individuals. It is therefore worth looking carefully at the individuals who
  survive such experiences intact; they obviously have an exceptional skill at being alone and we can learn from them. Over and over again this small and admirable group reports the value of having
  deep-laid, secure material in one’s memory-bank.</p>
<p>In 1949 Edith Hajos Bone was arrested in Hungary, where she was working as a journalist. She was kept in solitary confinement – often in the dark, sometimes in the wet, without any
  recreational facilities (like books or even sewing), subjected to occasional interrogation sessions, and never told what she was charged with or given any information about her future at all: all
  precisely the features most likely to lead to serious mental breakdown. She survived apparently entirely untouched. She ascribed this to her own mental discipline and intellectual resources. On a
  daily basis she would walk herself, imaginatively, round cities she had visited; recite poetry – and translate it from one language to another; keep in touch with her own body through the
  careful medical details she had had to learn by heart as a student doctor. In her autobiography she mentions several other sources of ‘amusement’, which relied on a well-filled mind:
  for example, she extracted threads from her towel and wove them into cords:</p>
<p>One had to be careful not to be caught in the act of pulling threads out of the towel. These were only changed once a fortnight and so it took me about two months to get
      the required thirty-two threads from which to plait my cord. Fortunately for myself, I had always been a fanatical lover of knots, and possessed that most remarkable publication, The Ashley
      Book of Knots, which I had studied assiduously and which, in addition to knots, also contained a number of sinnets. I plaited a beautiful sinnet – a round one, the sort known as
      coach-whipping – out of thirty-two threads in groups of eight.</p>
<p>(Edith Bone, Seven Years Solitary (Hamish Hamilton, 1957).)</p>
<p>There are so many examples of the empowerment provided by having external material to hand – private, personal and learned along the pulses – that I do wonder if
  the fear that our heads are empty and that we are without reliable points of connection is one of the causes of our contemporary terror of being alone. It is worth remembering that the joyful
  desert hermits of the third to fifth centuries were almost entirely illiterate: their daily recitation of the psalms – the recommended and clearly much-loved rhythmical repetition – was
  done entirely from memory, the rich fruit of ‘rote learning’.</p>
