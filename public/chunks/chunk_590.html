        <h3>¶ Eudaimonia</h3>
<p>Eudaimonia is an Ancient Greek word, particularly emphasised by the philosophers Plato and Aristotle, that deserves wider currency. It corrects the shortfalls in one of the most central, governing but insufficient terms in our contemporary idiom: happiness.</p>
<p>When we nowadays try to articulate the purpose of our lives, it is to the word ‘happiness’ that we commonly have recourse. We tell ourselves and others that the ultimate rationale for our jobs, our relationships and the conduct of our day-to-day lives is the pursuit of happiness. It sounds like an innocent enough idea, but excessive reliance on the term means that we are frequently unfairly tempted to exit or at least heavily question a great many testing but worthwhile situations.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks resolutely did not believe that the purpose of life was to be happy; they proposed that it was to achieve eudaimonia, a word that has been best translated as ‘fulfilment’.</p>
<p>What distinguishes happiness from fulfilment is pain. It is eminently possible to be fulfilled and, at the same time, under pressure, suffering physically or mentally, overburdened and frequently tetchy. This is a psychological nuance that the word ‘happiness’ makes it hard to capture, for it is tricky to speak of being happy yet unhappy or happy yet suffering. However, such a combination is readily accommodated within the dignified and noble-sounding letters of eudaimonia.</p>
<p>The word encourages us to trust that many of life’s most worthwhile projects will at points be quite at odds with contentment and yet are worth pursuing nevertheless. Properly exploring our professional talents, managing a household, keeping a relationship going, creating a new business venture or engaging in politics – none of these goals is likely to leave us cheerful and grinning on a quotidian basis. They will involve us in all manner of challenges that will exhaust and enervate us, provoke and wound us. Yet we will, perhaps, at the end of our lives, still feel that the tasks were worth undertaking. Through them, we will have accessed something grander and more interesting than happiness: we will have made a difference.</p>
<p>With the word eudaimonia in mind, we can stop imagining that we should aim for a pain-free existence, and then berate ourselves unfairly for being in a bad mood. We will know that we are trying to do something far more important than smile: we are striving to do justice to our full human potential and to work in some small but key way towards the improvement of our species.</p>
