        <h2>XIV: THE PARAPHRASE ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>There are arguments that start with one person gently trying to explain a difficult situation to their partner: There’s going to be an unfortunate clash of schedules around their birthday; the household budget has been overstretched; the car has received a dent; a friend has invited themselves to dinner …</p>
<p>The partner will listen stony-faced for a while, and then interrupt with an extremely abrupt, or more accurately brutal, paraphrase of what they have just heard. ‘If I’m getting this correctly,’ they might summarise, ‘you’ve just ruined the holiday.'</p>
<p>Person A: The long version</p>
<p>Person B: The paraphrase</p>
<p>‘Because I was maybe a bit more ambitious in my sense of what income I’d be getting next month compared to the month before, I allowed myself to invest in some things that, with the benefit of hindsight, I’d perhaps not have gone for …’</p>
<p>‘We’re bankrupt.’</p>
<p>‘Jake told me that he might be around after seeing his sister, as he isn’t going to go to the museum. And seeing as we have enough space here, and your mum won’t come till tomorrow anyway, and there’s a big lasagne in the fridge, I thought I might ask him to join us …’</p>
<p>‘Dinner is ruined.’</p>
<p>‘We got close, we shared various things, but it never meant too much and it’s nothing like what people might think. I never forgot what we had and have …’</p>
<p>‘You’ve slept with someone else and destroyed our marriage.’</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why, in crucial areas of our lives, we crave the long and complicated explanations. They are the guardians of humanity and civilisation. They are rounded, sympathetic and kindly. Many great works of art are, in effect, lengthy explanations for actions which might, in less subtle hands, be cruelly paraphrased. A headline summary like ‘Woman fucked around and spent all the money’ can, when narrated by a complex genius, end up as Gustave Flaubert’s masterpiece Madame Bovary. Great novels remind us that our motives, needs, anxieties and hopes are complicated and strange sounding, but told properly can win sympathy and understanding – and be revealed as deserving of the utmost dignity.</p>
<p>In the course of arguments, the one giving the long story is, in a sense, trying to be Flaubert. That is, they are trying to communicate a complicated, morally intricate, non-obvious set of truths. Why then, do their efforts tend to go so awry?</p>
<p>When a person in a couple has done something wrong or tricky, three things need to happen for the situation to start to be repaired. There should be:</p>
<p>1.   an admission</p>
<p>2.   an apology</p>
<p>3.   an explanation</p>
<p>For the perpetrator, it is the third move that is the most compelling and significant. It’s the explanation that will put their actions into context, that will stop them becoming a pariah in their own and the other’s eyes and that will enable them to hold on to their humanity.</p>
<p>However, this is unlikely to be what is uppermost in the minds of their partner. For them, it is the second point, the apology, that is most important and that will allow for repair, because it is a sign that the other has properly understood the difficulties they have caused and assumed due responsibility for them.</p>
<p>If the perpetrator keeps returning to the explanation and avoids the task of giving much by way of an apology, the recipient may – in frustration and hurt – seek revenge by zeroing in on the original admission, hammering home the deed until it is put in the crudest terms. It’s not that they’re unaware that there may be a host of subtle explanations to be heard; it’s just that they are in no mood to hear them unless and until the perpetrator has taken appropriate responsibility.</p>
<p>Then again, the blame isn’t on one side only. If the wounded party too readily suggests that they will be excessively vindictive, then the guilty party will have an understandable impetus to avoid overly candid admissions.</p>
<p>We bear, within couples, joint responsibility for facing up, with requisite gentleness, to one another’s many misdeeds. We should have the chance to give the morally complicated explanations we deserve – once we have taken on the responsibility that is our due.</p>
