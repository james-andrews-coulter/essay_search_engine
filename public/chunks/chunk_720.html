            <h2>ANXIETY &amp; EVOLUTION</h2>
<p>We’re used to singing the praises of the human mind and body; they are, from many perspectives, truly astonishing pieces of engineering. We have brains capable of doing fractal equations, translating Finnish into Bengali and performing La traviata – and bodies that can scale the Matterhorn, send balls over a tennis net at 263km/h and create new life that can last up to a century. And yet, for all that, we should admit how questionably designed we truly are in many areas, if only to forgive ourselves for the mess and sadness we typically generate. It’s not simply our fault that we’re anxious; the machines we’re trying to live through are riddled with flaws.</p>
<p>We are the outcome of evolutionary processes that have left us less than ideally adapted for what is required of us. Our anatomy is filled with redundant or vestigial organs. We have no need for our coccyx, the last part of our vertebrae that is the remnant of the tail that now gives us backache and growing pains. Nor do we have any use for our wisdom teeth, male nipples or appendices. And comparable vestigial problems exist in the mind:</p>
<p>•      Our wiring is massively and awkwardly oversensitive to our childhoods. Most of us still haven’t dealt with our early years by the time we reach old age.</p>
<p>•      We tend to be unhelpfully mean towards ourselves. We’re far kinder to most of our enemies – largely because we internalise methods of self-judgement that are modelled on some of the sternest judges from our personal histories.</p>
<p>•      We’re very bad at thinking: we panic easily, we resist important thoughts, we long for distraction and are squeamish interpreters of ourselves. We have a devilishly hard time working out what job we might do, how we might tap our talents and what is truly driving us.</p>
<p>•      We get wildly over-concerned about some threats while ignoring others, especially the threat of not appreciating what we have while there is still time. We can’t correctly separate the real dangers from the false alarms.</p>
<p>•      We worry far too much about the consequences of others’ views of us; we behave as if we still dwell in small tribes, where every piece of gossip could matter, and waste years improving our image in the minds of strangers we will never meet.</p>
<p>•      We exaggerate our chances of happiness – and suffer from bitter disappointment as a result. We can’t gracefully accept just how likely it is that we won’t be rich or won’t have happy marriages – and rail at the unfairness of our condition, which is, in fact, just the statistical norm.</p>
<p>•      We have addictive tendencies, especially for food, alcohol, pornography and sitting on sofas.</p>
<p>•      We think of sex far too often, given the opportunities and our competing priorities.</p>
<p>•      And finally, of course, we are entirely biased towards being unhappy. Very little in our biology is interested in us being content. There must have been an early evolutionary advantage in being fretful and easily triggered: the others got eaten. Nature, apparently, would prefer we were worried ninety-nine percent of the time rather than lived in a relaxed way and fell prey to a tiger. So, we let the finest days pass without appreciation. We can’t – naturally – ever ‘live in the moment’, a dauntingly ambitious and inadvertently cruel phrase.</p>
<p>•      In order to deal with our troublesome, ill-adapted bodies, we invented medicine, nutrition and exercise. To help us cope with our equally wonky minds, we need to lean just as heavily (as we do here) on philosophy, psychotherapy and self-reflection.</p>
