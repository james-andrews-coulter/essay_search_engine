        <h2>6. HAVE WE TRIED EVERYTHING?</h2>
<p>One of the preconditions of a successful ending to any relationship is a secure sense that we have ‘tried everything’ before closing the door behind us. Only once we are reasonably certain that we have exhausted all options can a departure start to feel considered and therefore warranted. The greatest hedge against regret is effort.</p>
<p>Among the effortful options, few can be as gruelling but also as vital as the business of couples therapy. One might go so far as to propose that no relationship should ever be considered doomed until one has tried out no less but also not much more than nine months of couples therapy.</p>
<p>Like many things that help relationships, couples therapy can sound deeply unromantic, involving visits to a usually drab consulting room, where we must face a host of embarrassing conversations about matters that it would be much nicer never to have to think about, let alone discuss with a partner and a trained stranger.</p>
<p>Our culture teaches us to trust and follow our feelings in love. But couples therapy knows this to be highly problematic, for our feelings are frequently erroneous and encoded with primitive responses from the troublesome past. Instead, it encourages us to stand back from our instincts, to neutralise them through understanding and, where possible, to reroute them in less selfpunishing, less impatient and more trusting directions. Living alongside another person is one of the hardest things we can ever attempt; couples therapy knows this, and so it suggests that we should expect to get it wrong unaided and feel unashamed about the need for in-depth training.</p>
<p>There are a number of vital things we might learn in our months in therapy. For a start, in a quiet room, we finally have the chance to define what we feel the problems in the relationship really are, without things degenerating into shouting, sulking or avoidance. We’re normally far too cross with, or upset by, our partner to be able to share with them, in a way they might understand, what we’re angry and upset with them about. It helps to be in front of a stranger we’re both a little intimidated by and with whom we have to behave ourselves. It is highly unusual to be able to put things so starkly, but also so reasonably: ‘That you never touch me and behave so limply and unenthusiastically when I touch you is slowly killing me – and though I love you, I don’t know how much longer I can take it.’ How much better to voice something like this than to go through a decade of low-level sniping and repressed fury.</p>
<p>Secondly, therapists are skilled at teasing out from us why what bothers us bothers us. Normally, left to our own devices, we don’t unearth the emotional meaning behind our positions. We squabble about where to go on the weekend, rather than explaining what going out or staying in represents for us internally. As a result, the other finds us merely stubborn and mean, and all that is interesting and poignant in our position is lost.</p>
<p>Thirdly, therapists break up unseen, repeated patterns of upset and retaliation. A classic therapeutic game is to ask both parties to fill in the blanks:</p>
<p>When you… I feel… and I respond by…</p>
<p>So: ‘When you disregard the children, I feel rejected and then respond by trying to control who you see in the evenings.’ Or: ‘When you don’t touch me in bed, I feel invisible and respond by being ungrateful about your money.’</p>
<p>With the therapist acting as an honest broker, new contracts can be drawn up, along the lines of: ‘If you do x, I will do y.’ Once we get a little bit of what we really want (but usually haven’t properly asked for), the other’s needs feel a lot less onerous and hateful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the advice is almost beautifully pedantic. Name three things you resent about your partner. And, next, three things you deeply appreciate. Keep the criticism specific: not ‘you’re cold and ungrateful’, but ‘if you can call me when you’re running late, then….’ Families can be kept intact with as little as this.</p>
<p>Through therapy, we are challenged to abandon some of our grimmer ideas about how people can be and what will happen to us in love: ‘If I am vulnerable, I am not necessarily going to be hurt’, or ‘I might try to explain, and the other could listen.’ We are given the security to throw out some of the scripts we grew up with about the futility of ever trying to be understood. We can start to be moved by one another’s pain. ‘What does it feel like’, a good therapist will ask, ‘to hear your partner explain how it is for them when you…?’ We can start to take care of each other. A remarkable idea comes to the fore: that our partner isn’t really our enemy; that they – like us – have some very bad ways of getting across what are some very understandable and touching needs.</p>
<p>Couples therapy is a classroom where we can learn how to love. We’re normally so embarrassed by not having the first clue how to do that so we leave things until we are too angry or despairing to do anything but hate. The most hopeful and therefore romantic thing we can ever do in relationships is sometimes to declare that we haven’t yet learnt how to love – but, with a little help, are keen to learn one day.</p>
<p>Of course, all this may not work. The partner might not listen as we had hoped, and vice versa. In the cold light of the consulting room, we might come to see them as intransigent and not worthy of our care. Our exchanges, far from advancing understanding, might serve to reveal just how unable we are to make any sense to one another. Far from rescuing the relationship, couples therapy might conclusively bury it.</p>
<p>However, this need not be an argument against therapy. A failed course at least provides us with useful proof of why things had to end. It may not have saved love, but it will have done something almost as valuable: made us a little less sad, and a little more sure, that it has died.</p>
