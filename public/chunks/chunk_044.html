            <h2>The Womb &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>Let us return to young children. It seems appropriate that the world’s most famous baby should have been melancholy. Though Jesus went on to have a very unusual and especially tragic destiny, there is a universal theme in his story, and that is what may touch us when we see him depicted as a child. Like all of us, he is sad – in part – because he has been forced to leave the womb.</p>
<p>This sounds odd, and it is meant to. After all, none of us ever remembers being in the womb; we don’t go around with any active sense of nostalgia for our first home. The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein speculated that this was no coincidence: if we remembered the womb, then our sorrow for what we had been forced to give up and our dissatisfaction with our present circumstances might reach such a pitch, it would be too intense to bear. We have to forget what we once had as a price for having the courage to continue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it may be helpful to think of ourselves as still somewhere pining for the womb. By this, one means pining for a time when we were not so incomplete, a time when we didn’t need to be afraid, when we didn’t have apprehensions about the future, when we were fused with someone else, when every one of our needs was magically catered for by blood pumping through a rubbery cable, whose stub remains on our front as a reminder of that original severance.</p>

<p>We may be nostalgic without knowing what for, nostalgic for a womb we have forgotten. There are moments of great closeness and comfort in adult life. Occasionally, we may be in a very tender person’s arms; sometimes, someone cooks us a deeply tasty meal. But what can the most devoted lover offer us in terms of reassurance, or the most assiduous restaurant or hotel give us in terms of sensitivity to our needs, as compared with what was once on offer in our first home?</p>
<p>Given that we may be privately – and unconsciously – judging our adult experiences against the measure of very early perfection, it’s no wonder if we often feel a bit dissatisfied and disconsolate. The biblical story of the expulsion from paradise is really a version of the story of our own birth. We all were once in a place where we didn’t have to ask for anything, where nourishment came to us automatically and where we were in the hands of a kindly immense being.</p>
<p>No wonder many babies look a bit sad: they have lost so much. The religious are lucky, for they are offered a chance to return ‘home’ in the next life. For the secular melancholic, though, there is no pathway home. The lonely pilgrimage goes on forever. At least, if we are able to name the place we’d so love to return to, we may help ourselves to understand the scale (and the impossibility) of our desire. We should admit how much – despite all the advantages of adult life – we still really miss the womb.</p>
