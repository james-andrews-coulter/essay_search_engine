        <h2>A QUIET LIFE</h2>
<p>We may, in our stronger moments, want to take on the world again and revive our largest ambitions. We should be careful of our motives. We don’t need to be extraordinary to deserve to be. We should see the glory and the grandeur that are present in an apparently modest destiny. We are good enough as we are. We don’t need huge sums of money or to be spoken of well by strangers. We need time to process our feelings and—lying in bed, say, or in the bath—soothe our frightened minds. We should take pride in our early nights and undramatic routines. These aren’t signs of passivity or tedium. What looks like a normal life on the outside is a singular achievement given what we are wrestling with inside.</p>
<p>HUMOR</p>
<p>There is no need for gravity. We can face down the illness by laughing heartily at its evils. We are “mad” and “cracked” and can say so honestly—but luckily so are many others with whom we can wryly mock the absurdities of mental life. We shouldn’t, on top of everything else, accord our illness too much portentous respect.</p>
