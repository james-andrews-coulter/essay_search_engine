        <h2>III. Engagement</h2>
<p>On the pleasures of engagement, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s books on ‘flow’ (Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play; Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience; and others) offer perhaps the most promising propositions on how to achieve states of full involvement and absorbed satisfaction in work and play.</p>
<p>In Together: The Pleasures, Rituals and Politics of Cooperation, Richard Sennett, a philosophically informed sociologist, talks about the urgent need, in our diverse societies, to learn the practices of cooperation and solidarity, on every level from work to civil society – and to be engaged with others in collaborative rather than competitive ways.</p>
<p>In Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age, Sherry Turkle reminds us that conversation is crucial to all forms of relationship and knowledge, and that in shifting to digital communications in lieu of living contact, we are in danger of degrading our capacities for empathy, learning through dialogue and for forms of public debate. We need to reclaim the space for conversation in order to nurture forms of contact basic to our common culture and our humanity.</p>
<p>For a historical attempt to capture good talk before the digital age, read The Age of Conversation by Benedetta Craveri – an un-nostalgic history of the French salon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the rise of conversation as a highly valued skill. Full of diverting facts about who was there, and who said what to whom, The Age of Conversation is also a serious look at the salon as an important political institution and space for unofficial discussion.</p>
<p>For the value of play, Homo Ludens by Johan Huizinga is the classic, but probably still unsurpassed text. Huizinga, a Dutch historian who was one of the founders of cultural history, looks at the origins of culture in the ‘play element’ of ritual, spectacle, riddles and games. An original and fascinating book, giving us glimpses of sensibilities very different from our own; and at the same time, reminding us that play is a basic feature of many human activities, and the basis of the creative imagination.</p>
<p>Children’s Games in Street and Playground by Iona and Peter Opie is a study, based on extended observation, of games – sometimes very rough – generated and invented by children themselves. The Opies were students of children’s ‘folklore’, and offer wonderful evidence of children’s need for play, and their spontaneous creativity, when they are left to their own devices. A book about play in the pre-digital age.</p>
