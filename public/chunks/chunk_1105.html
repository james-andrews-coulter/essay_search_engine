        <h4>THERE’S THIS THING ABOUT ME AND SEX</h4>
<p>There is something you want to try or a fantasy that grips your imagination – a special garment you would like your partner to wear, or a scenario involving another person – but you are worried your partner will find the contents of your mind outlandish or strange. And yet, for the relationship to flourish, you crave for your partner to understand your thought processes. You face a conflict between honesty and kindness.</p>
<p>The immediate tendency is either to remain silent or to stress how much you want something different, which may cast your partner as unadventurous, frightened or disappointing. A better strategy is to shift matters from a demand to a pressure-free, playful, intellectual exploration.</p>
<p>→I thought both of us could think more about our fantasies as a way of getting to know each other properly. I’d love to understand more about you – and you about me.</p>
<p>However liberated our societies tell us we are, most of us maintain a deep sense of privacy and shame around aspects of our sexuality. But rather than viewing this as a tragedy, we can turn it into an opportunity to create a unique bond with someone we care for. They will be as unlikely as us to have shared much of who they are sexually.</p>
<p>→I know this could sound weird, but…</p>
<p>It’s always useful to signal an awareness that one may frighten someone, given that truly weird people never give this a thought.</p>
<p>→I want to play at being aggressive while obviously loving and caring for you. I want to call you rude and disrespectful things – even while I profoundly respect you.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why we feel so ashamed of our desires is that we’re never encouraged to conceive of them as logical. The key move is to think of every sexual fantasy as counteracting a particular fear or difficulty in our lives as a whole. Every fantasy tells you fascinating things about what has been awkward in someone’s background.</p>
<p>→For a long time, I was puzzled why I wanted this. But then I asked myself: what is this fantasy doing for me? What bits of my psychology does it appeal to? Given my past, what fears is it working to alleviate?</p>
<p>Sexual fantasy isn’t usually mysterious; it is a response to a tension in our lives, which it promises to solve for a while. Someone with a bad experience around their father might want their partner to wear a uniform because they wish to re-imagine authority not as oppressive but as a source of pleasure and reassurance. Someone might want to play at being submissive because their day-to-day life places them under almost unbearable pressure to be responsible.</p>
<p>→When I think about why I might want rough sex, it’s perhaps because the idea counteracts my real experiences in which I feared that I might hurt those I love by showing them my more uninhibited sides. It springs from a longing to be fully myself – and yet acceptable.</p>
<p>A specific desire has emerged for you because of many precise and rather touching things about your personal history. What is vital is to stress that a fantasy is not a plan for real-world action; it is an alternative to it.</p>
<p>→I am profoundly uninterested in force in real life. The very idea is shocking. It’s just that I love the idea of playing this as a game.</p>
<p>We adults get confused about games; we often think of them as anticipations of reality. But that is to miss the pleasure of being able to pretend. Children know that you can play at being a wolf or a pirate without wanting to be one in life as a whole; we should be as wise and imaginative.</p>
<p>→Maybe a lot of us are odder sexually than we suppose; perhaps lots of things are pretty normal that don’t sound normal.</p>
<p>For thousands of generations, being aligned with the standard behaviour of your tribe was an important factor in survival. But our picture of what other people are actually like around sex is liable to be sketchy and distorted. We are all much weirder than we let on – thankfully.</p>
<p>→I’d love to hear more about the strange-but-actually-not-so strange things that turn you on.</p>
<p>Intimacy is built on a longing to reveal our ‘weirder’ sides – and on the joyful discovery that those aspects might be OK with one special person.</p>
