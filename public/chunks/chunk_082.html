        <h2>The Inner Critic &amp; Melancholy</h2>
<p>We almost all have a character inside our minds whom we might call the inner critic. It tends to pay its visits late at night. It waits until we’re very tired or physically depleted, and it then starts to whisper vicious and appalling things to us in order to destroy all possibility of peace, self-confidence and self-compassion. It is, at base, convinced that we shouldn’t really exist, and it’s extremely subtle and inventive about telling us why. It is, in extremis, the inner critic that tells people to go and kill themselves.</p>
<p>Too often, in the face of yet another onslaught by the inner critic, our minds freeze: we simply don’t know how to answer back. We’re in a tunnel alone with the critic and forget that there might be any other perspectives to bring to bear on our situation. We let ourselves be assailed by merciless accusations, and sink into self-flagellation and despair.</p>
<p>We should – when our minds clear – prepare one or two things we might say in reply to the critic when it next comes calling.</p>
