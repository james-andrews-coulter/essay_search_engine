<hr />
<p>Do not think that the person who seeks to console you lives untroubled and in accord with the simple and quiet words that sometimes help you. His life has much hardship
  and sadness, and remains far behind yours. If it were otherwise, he could never have found those words.</p>
<p>– R. M. Rilke, Letter to Franz Kappus, 12 August 1904</p>
