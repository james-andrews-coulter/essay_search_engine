        <h1>Relating Difficulties: Case Studies</h1>
<p>Loneliness and disappointment in relationships can be mitigated if we become mindful of the ways in which we act, and take steps to feel and behave differently. The following two case studies demonstrate how we might go about this.</p>
<p>Zara</p>
<p>Zara was chaotic in her relationships. She was unable to feel secure with a partner and habitually sabotaged her romantic relationships at an early stage, by acting on her feelings instead of first observing them to give herself the chance to choose how she acted. She was twenty-eight and wanted to find someone to spend the rest of her life with. Using self-observation she noticed a certain pattern in her relationships and she noted down the pattern in her diary:</p>
<ol>
<li>She would choose someone who was good-looking and/or charismatic.</li>
<li>She would go to bed with him at the earliest opportunity.</li>
<li>After sex, she would feel that she was ‘in love’ with him.</li>
<li>She would behave in a ‘needy’ way and ring him up too much.</li>
<li>The relationship died, usually after a couple of months.</li>
<li>She would be heartbroken.
This was the hole, the habit, the pattern – whatever you want to call it – that Zara was in.</li>
</ol>
<p>She made a decision and set out a couple of guidelines for herself. When the next man came along, she would: a) not go to bed with him before they had established a relationship; and b) not act in a ‘needy’ way, even when she felt needy.</p>
<p>After a while Zara met a man at evening classes who seemed interested in becoming her friend. She did not assume they would become romantic, but they liked spending time together and met up for a drink once or twice a week. This went on for six months. Then they went on holiday together as friends, but came back as lovers. Zara felt the neediness rise up in her. She wanted to know what he was doing and where he was every second of the day: was he thinking about her? But instead of acting on this urge, she exorcised it, to some extent, merely by writing it all down in a private diary. This resolve not to ‘smother’ the man concerned appears to have been a good guideline, because their relationship continued to deepen, they married and now, decades later, they are still happily together.</p>
<p>So, although I am wary of rules, I have to admit that, in Zara’s example, they did allow her to steer her life onto a happier course. Using self-observation you may discover chaotic patterns in your relationship and decide to implement a rule like Zara did, using it as a temporary splint until a more permanent, flexible middle way is found.</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Rather than rules, Sam needed more flexibility in his life. He had rules such as never to talk about the weather, or to even ask the generic question ‘How are you?’ Sam deemed such ordinary, ‘grooming’ questions meaningless, and wrote off anyone who used them. His rules made him difficult to get on with and resulted in him living a lonely existence, with little contact with the outside world. He gained some comfort in thinking himself superior to the rest of the population, but feeling superior is no substitute for companionship and the positive difference friends make to a life. Sam became lonely and depressed. When the depression became unbearable he went to see his doctor, who referred him to a counsellor, Simon.</p>
<p>After he had learnt to trust Simon, which took a year of weekly sessions (neural pathways take time to alter), Sam was able to become aware of how he had established his own particular rule book, and how many of his rules were out of date. Supported by Simon, Sam experimented with change and allowed himself more contact with other people. He has not embarked upon a romantic relationship, nor become a party animal, but he has let a few other people into his life, is less lonely, less rigid and is no longer as depressed.</p>
<p>Philosophers ask themselves the question, ‘If a tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it, has it, in fact, made a sound?’ I wonder if this question is really asking, ‘Would we exist if no one witnessed our existence?’ Perhaps we have to ask that, because without another soul or souls to check in with, pass the time with, be affected by and affect, a part of us does seem to diminish. We do feel less human and we are more likely to go insane without the checks and challenges of other good-willed people around us. Solitary confinement is one of the most brutal, most stressful punishments we inflict on our fellow humans. If we are to stay sane, we must not inflict it upon ourselves.</p>
