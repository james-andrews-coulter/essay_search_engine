            <h3>¶ Universal Love</h3>
<p>The itinerant Galilean preacher known as Jesus not only spoke a great deal about love, but he also went on to advocate that we love some highly surprising people. At one point – described in chapter 7 of Luke’s Gospel – he goes to a dinner party and a local prostitute turns up, much to the disgust of the hosts. But Jesus is friendly and sweet and defends her against everyone else’s criticism. In a way that shocks the other guests, he insists that she is a good person at heart.</p>
<p>There’s another story (in Matthew, chapter 8) where Jesus is approached by a man with leprosy. He’s in a disgusting state. But Jesus isn’t shocked; he reaches out his hand and touches the man. Despite the horrendous appearance, here is someone (in Jesus’s eyes) entirely deserving of closeness and kindness. In a similar vein, at other times, Jesus conspicuously argues that tax collectors, thieves and adulterers are never to be thought of as outside the circle of love.</p>
<p>Many centuries after Jesus’s death, the foremost medieval thinker Thomas Aquinas defined what Jesus was getting at in this way of talking about love: the person who truly understands love could love anyone, wrote Aquinas. In other words: true love isn’t specific in its target; it doesn’t fixate on particular qualities; it is open to all of humanity, even (and in a way especially) its less appealing examples.</p>
<p>This can sound like a deeply strange notion of what love is, for our background ideas about love tend to be closely tied to a dramatic experience: that of falling in love, finding one, very specific person immensely attractive, exciting and free of any failings or drawbacks. Love is, we feel, a response to the overt perfection of another person.</p>
<p>Yet – via some admittedly extreme examples – a very important aspect of love is being pushed to the fore in Jesus’s vision. And we don’t have to be Christian – that is, we don’t have to believe that there’s an afterlife or that Jesus was born to a virgin – to benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the heart of this kind of love is an effort to see beyond the outwardly unappealing surface of another human in search of the tender, interesting, scared and vulnerable person inside.</p>
<p>What we know as the ‘work’ of love is the emotional, imaginative labour required to peer behind an off-putting façade. Our minds tend to resist such a move. They follow well-worn grooves that feel at once familiar and justified. If someone has hurt us, we almost inevitably see them as mean, rather than, as might be the case, anxious or sad.</p>
<p>It takes quite a deliberate, taxing effort of the mind to move ourselves off our deeply established responses and to learn to see that everyone is, ultimately, fragile, hurt, damaged and deserving of love.</p>
