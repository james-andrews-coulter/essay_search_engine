            <h4>Pleasure</h4>
<p>We pretend to be having fun skiing and in nightclubs, at the theatre and reading the long novel that won a very important prize. We pretend to love our friends. We lie about how bored we are. We strive not to admit to what we really do like: staying in; eating strange things in a disgusting way alone in the kitchen late at night; plotting revenge; seeing no one; wasting time; buying gadgets; and looking up the fate of ex-lovers and colleagues from long ago.</p>
<p>In the process, without meaning to, we perpetuate a world in which everyone else has to lie along with us. Because everyone refrains from uttering their truths, the price of breaking cover remains impossibly high. We collude in a mass conspiracy to suggest that love, sex, work, family life, friends and holidays unfold in a way we know in our hearts they simply don’t. We remain at the dawn of any collective capacity to acknowledge what fundamental parts of life are actually like.</p>
<p>A lack of love holds us back. We are emotional liars because, somewhere during our upbringing, we failed to imbibe a robust sense that we might be acceptable in and of our essence. No one said with enough conviction that we were allowed just to be. We were given convincing lessons in how not to speak our more dangerous thoughts clearly. We became experts at complying. We came to associate being good and normal with being someone else.</p>
<p>How much more interesting it might be if we dared to be a little braver, and conceived of many encounters as opportunities to risk the sharing of new truths. We might realise that our picture of what might happen if we are honest derives from outdated or irrelevant contexts: childhood, the company of narrow-minded schoolmates, obvious bullies, social media … Learning not to lie would not only be of egoistic benefit; our vulnerability would invite, and rehabilitate, that of others. Every confession we could muster would allow our companions to let go of a part of their own loneliness. Every move towards greater honesty would edge us towards a less needlessly isolated and painfully shame-filled world.</p>
