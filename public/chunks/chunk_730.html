        <h2>Resentment</h2>
<p>There is no worse enemy of love than resentment, because we don’t usually notice its presence or realise its power. Resentment starts as anger against a lover that, out of modesty or pride, we neither properly acknowledge to ourselves nor cleanly express to our partner. We seethe, but privately and unknowingly, and as a consequence we fall prey to depression, moodiness and a lack of desire.</p>
<p>At the core of the problem is the fact that resentments tend to be generated by what can look – from the outside – like absurdly small factors. We don’t notice how annoyed we are and then hold back from ‘making a fuss’ with someone we still long to appear impressive in front of. We suffer in silence because we operate with a hugely inadequate picture of what we’re allowed to be upset by, and yet we get upset all the same – only more so and without a chance of catharsis.</p>
<p>We would need a very attentive documentary team to catch resentments as they build. Our partner might say only ‘hmm’ when we mention that we are worried about a situation at work. Or they might get a little too excited at the prospect of meeting up with an old friend, when they are rarely pleased to meet anyone we introduce them to. Or they might buy a piece of clothing without asking us what we think – unlike the concern they used to show for our views on their wardrobe in the early days.</p>
<p>Few of us are ever completely sure of whether we matter solidly to the partner we depend on. Doubts constantly creep in – often fuelled by the vagaries and pains of our early lives. Love’s survival can rarely, in our deep minds, be entirely assured. But we know too that we cannot be ‘childish’, that we should not whine and that no one likes a needy person.</p>
<p>Yet the trouble with small resentments is that, like a constant drip of water onto granite, they can eventually bore into the centre of our minds. Just as our bodies may be immensely sensitive to trace amounts of certain substances (a minute quantity of strychnine will kill us almost at once), so our minds can be conclusively offended by a missing smile or a tiny delay before a greeting. And yet not only are we infinitely sensitive, we refuse properly to accept the extent to which we might be so.</p>
<p>The idea that little details can need, and deserve, careful attention is one that we have no trouble recognising in certain privileged areas of life. We will go along with a musician who agonises for weeks about the exact nature of the percussion during a chorus and gets very upset when, in the final version, it’s not exactly as they had wished. We have no difficulty in appreciating that, during a screening of a new film, a director might want to suggest tiny variations in sequencing and pace in order to make a closing scene more effective. We allow a poet to spend hours wondering if a specific word is right for a particular line; an interior designer will be praised for worrying about the precise hang and fall of the folds in a curtain. We don’t think any of these people are being fussy or over-intense. Indeed, we may acclaim them as geniuses for picking up so well on details that coarser minds might overlook.</p>
<p>However, when we come to something no less important – the success or failure of love – we lose confidence in the entire concept of details being worthy of time, consideration, intelligent discussion and (perhaps) adjustment. Instead, we accuse ourselves of ‘making a big deal about nothing’ and worry we might be whining.</p>
<p>An ideal session of resentment analysis would make it clear that we were discussing only details, while nevertheless acknowledging that details can matter a lot. There would be a sense that much might be going very well in a couple but, like the film director in the cutting room or the musician in the studio, we are giving ourselves a chance to focus in on details, not in order to create problems, but to ensure that small ones don’t metastasise. We would try to get as accurate as possible in explaining why a detail happened to matter to us. We would concede that there was probably nothing inherently awful about a given trigger – for example, the partner’s love of whistling or their passion for yoga. Other people would evidently have no problem with these things. We would then try to lay bare the personal story behind our specific antipathies.</p>
<p>Typically, the communicative error we make is to elaborate on how much we dislike something rather than why we do so. We say something is vulgar, ghastly, appalling or stupid, but this only intensifies, rather than resolves, conflict. What we should invariably strive to do is explain the origins of our distastes with particular reference to our fears, for fears are always a lot nicer to hear about than hates.</p>
<p>Doing so will force us to dig into our minds. Where is our sensitivity rooted? What bits of our pasts are being engaged? With whistling, the sound might give us the impression that our partner thinks they are alone in our presence; hearing them whistle, we feel as if we have temporarily been shut out of their existence – an idea that might feel especially painful because of the way we were handled in childhood by an erratic and often absent parent. Or the partner’s taste for yoga might evoke in us a picture of woolliness and disinterest in practical matters, which, on account of difficulties we suffered around money when we were young, might set off wildly inaccurate but frightening images of chaos and penury.</p>
<p>By tracing irritants back to personal fears, we stop them acquiring a moral dimension in our minds: they are about us and our vulnerabilities; they are not universal truths that we can pontificate on. We take responsibility for what annoys us, and at the same time we share our discomforts before they can build up into fully fledged arguments against the person we are trying very hard to love.</p>
