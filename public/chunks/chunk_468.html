        <h2>Thinking of the Worst</h2>
<p>When we are worried about failure and take our anxieties to our friends, the response that we are most likely to receive is that our fears are overblown and will almost certainly never come to pass. The error won’t be uncovered, the slip-up wasn’t noticed, the enemy isn’t so nasty, people won’t mind; it will be fine.</p>
<p>At first it sounds almost entirely reassuring. But something within the optimism being offered is likely to leave us with an uneasy feeling – one that we can’t entirely shake off, and that has a habit of reappearing late at night or when we are in a jittery mood. We desperately want to believe that we are safe, but what if – after all, despite the reassurance – we are not? Are there not many cases in which, despite good odds, things nevertheless go very, very wrong? What if the error is uncovered, what if our mistake is treated harshly – what if the world ends up in an unforgiving frame of mind?</p>
<p>These questions can pursue us relentlessly, growing ever more impervious to our optimism. We may try to pile more reassurance onto the fire of worry, but no matter what we attempt, the anxiety continues to mount. It’s at this point that we should try an initially alarming, but ultimately profoundly fruitful, move: thinking about, and making friends with, the very worst.</p>
<p>Rather than assuming that we will be saved, we should deliberately try to imagine every fear turning into reality: the shock of our clients, the surprise of our colleagues, the scandalised headlines in newspapers, the arrival of the police, the jeering of crowds, the packed courtroom, the bare prison cell, the lost decade in an institution, the desertion of lovers, the contempt of one’s children, the ruin of every last hope.</p>
<p>It might sound like a recipe for cataclysmic panic, but far from it: careful, close-up, reasoned examination of the worst-case scenario is liable to throw up a surprising fact: that the worst is actually survivable. Desirable it certainly isn’t, awful it would often be, but it would also – overall – turn out to be something that we could, just, get through.</p>
<p>We could – when we think about it – imagine losing all but two good friends and surviving. We could imagine spending a few years in prison or becoming a byword for infamy – and surviving. It absolutely wouldn’t be what we would wish for, but, all things considered, it would be endurable.</p>
<p>What our minds are especially and unduly tortured by is uncertainty. Often, what worries us most are outcomes that we cannot divine, issues over which we lack any firm control or definitive information: we can’t foresee whether we’ll get the right grades in an exam, we can’t know whether a business will go bust, we have no total assurance \ about whether our relationship will survive.</p>
<p>In such a situation, hungry for certainty, the racing, anxious mind throws us into constant turmoil. Wishing to be reassured completely, it keeps us awake with a litany of the same familiar questions: Will we be OK? Will the bad thing happen? Is it going to be fine?</p>
<p>To close off this tortuous cycle of never-ending questions, we should boldly stand up to our nagging selves and deliver a very definitive-sounding answer. We must assume that everything terrible will happen, and then concentrate all our energy on trying to figure out how the terrible might turn out to be bearable – which it will be, for certain.</p>
<p>It’s an ineradicable part of being human that we simply cannot know what elements of suffering we will need to pass through before we are at last delivered to our final resting place. Every day sees us walk – usually blithely – past a thousand risks. We may continue to pass through unharmed – or else a blunder or two will wind us up in infamy, poverty and shame. Right now, in another part of town or a faraway continent, our sad end may be being worked out. Disaster might strike by nightfall. We don’t need any formal belief in the gods to appreciate that our destinies are not in our own hands; that at any moment (whatever our levels of wealth, probity, youth or vigour) we might fall prey to the most appalling reversals – and so we would be wise to walk lightly and with reverence across the unpredictable, troubled face of the Earth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can buttress our natural exposure to fate with a tenacious degree of defiant stoic pessimism. We don’t have to greet the unknown in terror, on our knees, quivering. We may stand up tall, knowing that the most egregious events might visit us, but that we would – somehow – find a way through them. And, if we couldn’t, if every single breath was agony, we might even darkly allow – despite a million careful caveats – that the pain wouldn’t have to be endless. It’s in the context of the reassuring power of the very darkest thoughts that we can approach failure.</p>
<p>Many of us will never have to face real-world failure, but we will be haunted and tortured by the idea that we might have to – and in no position to be comforted by easy suggestions that things are sure to be fine. This is why we must consider at length the practical and psychological realities of extreme failure (the ideal sort of hut to build and how to handle the desertion of all our friends). Not because we will fail, but because the only way to dilute our fears is to examine the thought that we might in exhaustive detail – and thereby realise that it can be borne.</p>
<p>Those afraid of failure and those who have failed have much to offer one another. The failed are living proof that failure can be endured – while the fearful are an ideal constituency on which the failed (especially if they are looking out for new employment that can grant them a gainful sense of service) can practise their wisdom and deliver solace.</p>
<p>We waste far too much time scaling or dreaming of the peaks of worldly success. Now is the moment to turn our attention to becoming those unlikely, but much more important, members of society: good failures. These are people who know how to be kind, empathetic, gentle, humorous, humble, grateful and imaginative in the face of disaster – and who are therefore always ready to lend a hand to fellow vulnerable, ailing humans who have been damned by fate and who, for now, struggle to remember any reasons to live. That will be redemption and success properly worthy of the word.</p>
