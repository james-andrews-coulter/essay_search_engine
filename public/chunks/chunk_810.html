        <h2>MENTAL MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>We need to be rigorous with our patterns of thinking. We cannot afford to let our thoughts wander into any old section of the mind. There are thoughts that we need to nurture: about our worth, about our right to be, about the importance of keeping going, about self-forgiveness. And there are thoughts we should be ruthless in chasing out: about how some people are doing so much better than us, about how inadequate and pitiful we are, about what a disappointment we have turned out to be. The latter aren’t even “thoughts,” they have no content to speak of, they cannot teach us anything new. They are really just instruments of torture and symptoms of a difficult past.</p>
