            <h2>A SECOND MIND</h2>
<p>It may sound odd or impolite to suggest that most of us, when we are in the grip of mental illness, are no longer capable of thinking. That’s not how it feels of course. From the inside, our minds have probably never seemed so busy and so focused. From the moment we wake up in panic and self-disgust, we are ruminating, pondering, exploring catastrophic scenarios, scanning our past, attacking ourselves for things we have done and not done, questioning our legitimacy, talking to ourselves about how repulsive we are, paying attention to strange voices telling us that we are evil and sick and headed for the worst—and wondering whether and how we should kill ourselves. Our minds don’t give us a moment of respite. We may rub our temples to cool them down but when we eventually fall asleep we are exhausted by the marathons our thoughts have run inside us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we may still want to insist—for the kindest and most redemptive of reasons—that we have not been thinking at all, that none of this hive of activity deserves the title of thinking; it is just illness.</p>
<p>To be mentally ill is to be swamped by secretions of fear, self-hatred, and despair that, like surging seawater through a pumping station control desk, knock out all our higher faculties, all our normal ability to sensibly distinguish one thing from another, to find perspective, to weigh arguments judiciously, to see the wood for the trees, to correctly assess danger, to plan realistically for the future, to determine risks and opportunities, and, most importantly, to be kind and generous to ourselves.</p>
<p>None of these faculties function any longer, but—and this is the true nastiness of the illness—we are never and nowhere alerted to our loss. We are both very ill and very unaware. It looks as though we are continuing to think as we have always done, with all our usual intelligence and reliability, but that we just have a lot more to worry about. Nowhere along the way does our mind do us the honor of telling us that it has begun to look at reality through a distorted lens, that it has, at some point in the day, to all intents and purposes stopped working. No bell goes off, no hazard lights flash.</p>
<p>Yet the truth is that we have lost command of about a third of our minds and are pulling together our ideas from the most degenerate, traumatized, unreliable, and vicious aspects of ourselves. It’s as if a group of terrorists had donned white coats and were impersonating prestigious scientists in order to lay out a set of vicious theories and prognoses.</p>
<p>Once we have been through a few cycles of distorted thinking and finally recovered contact with reality, we should do ourselves the kindness of accepting that, on an intermittent basis, we will lose command of our higher faculties. There is nothing embarrassing in recognizing the possibility and accommodating ourselves to it very carefully.</p>
<p>We should get better at detecting when illness might be drawing in, what the triggers for it might be. Then, when it is upon us, we should do and decide nothing. We shouldn’t send emails or deliver judgment on our lives or plan for the future. We should, as much as possible, stop all mental activity and rest. We might listen to music, have a long bath, watch something untaxing on television, and perhaps take a calming pill.</p>
<p>We should also try to plug our brain into the brain of someone else, to benefit from their greater powers of reason. If we have a trusted friend or therapist on whom we can call at such moments, we should ask them if they might help recalibrate and regulate our thoughts with an injection of their wisdom and insight. We should willingly put them in charge of determining how things are for us. They should be allowed to tell us what we are worth, what we have done, what there is to worry about and that we should do our best to discount the doom-laden signals that emerge from inside us. They may be able to come up with innovative ideas that we’re no longer capable of recognizing—and that could save us. They might tell us that it’s OK to have secrets or that compromise is not always a disaster—concepts that our panicked minds would have had no way of conceptualizing.</p>
<p>We should strive to become thinkers who can acknowledge when they are no longer able to think.</p>
