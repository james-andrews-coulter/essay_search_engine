        <h3>5. Confessions</h3>
<p>Our friendships are so much poorer than they might be because of a regrettable belief that, in order to be worthy of affection, we should do everything to appear ‘normal’ to those closest to us.</p>
<p>In the name of this ideal, we make strenuous attempts to wash away the reality of our complicated and wayward natures. We suggest that we are far simpler than we are. We strive to erase our compulsions and our sinfulness, our perversion and our innocence, our rage and our tenderness. We clean ourselves up to greet our circle and along the way destroy opportunities to commune around our wretched and diﬃcult truths.</p>
<p>The highest purpose of friendship lies in a capacity to offer a fellow broken human a hopeful and redemptive message: I – like you – have been odd; I – like you – have been mad; I – like you – have been guilty. No one is normal, and therefore no one is beyond love and sympathy.</p>
<p>But how seldom we venture such candour. Let’s imagine that you and your partner have been getting on increasingly badly. It happens all the time (though still we greet our domestic problems as if they were isolated curses rather than universal aﬄictions). You tried to get a point across. They held an opposing line. You thought you were making progress; they seemed – in your eyes – to be holding things up vindictively and unreasonably. And then, after three and a half hours of talking, it happened: the apparently very strange, very abnormal, very unusual move that seems to place you beyond the circle of understanding. You called them an idiot; they called you a shithead. You went into the bathroom and, starting from the thumb end, put the palm of your hand deep in your mouth and bit very hard, so hard that there was blood and there are still teeth marks to this day.</p>
<p>We tell ourselves that friendship is an arena in which we can share our troubles with a fellow interested and sympathetic soul. But we also strongly suspect that mutual support in friendship is governed by an unstated rule: that our problems can never be very serious. Unfortunate things happen, of course, but they are to be quickly brushed away with a joke and a few heartening words. There are bumps on the road, but we must – to assure the union – remain essentially steady.</p>
<p>By the standards of polite society, hand-biting is a grotesque episode: to get so enraged is viewed as wrong in itself. How can we ever share such a thing with a friend, along with all the many other odd things we have done and will continue to do: slamming a door so hard it nearly came off its hinges; locking ourselves in the car and sobbing for an hour; fantasising about one of our partner’s siblings …?</p>
<p>It’s tempting – in trying to convey our lives to a friend – to stick to generalities. We mention that we had ‘an argument with our partner’ or that we ‘got a bit upset’. Yet if we are ever to liberate ourselves from the lies we have imprisoned ourselves in, we must come to our friendships with a more robust sense of what a human being is. We need to overcome the respectable fiction that we are not fearful, emotional, irrational creatures only a few millimetres from disaster and collapse at any point. It is only with great and benign efforts (and generally a lot of help from teachers and parents) that we ever learn to construct a more elegant, enlightened persona; that we get adept at maintaining a reasonable picture of ourselves and pretend that it is only certain other people (criminals, dictators) who fail to live up to this pleasing standard. But the darker truth is that our civilised selves sit on top of a tumultuous nature that is never more than a long argument and a bout of tiredness away.</p>
<p>We should dare to let more of our reality into our friendships. We are evidently not entirely respectable or balanced. We strive so hard to turn towards the light, but much of us will always lie in darkness. And yet we are – for all that – part of the human community, seeking permission to become friends of a deeper sort. It’s moving when two friends show each other kindness and love; it’s properly helpful when they also learn to show one another their darkness, their sins and the bite marks on their hands.</p>
