        <h2>VIII: THE ABSENTEE ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>There are so many ways in which the world wounds us. At work, our manager repeatedly humiliates and belittles us; we hear of a party to which we were not invited; a better-looking, wealthier person snubs us at a conference; we develop a skill that turns out not to be much in demand in the world; some people we were at university with set up a hugely successful business.</p>
<p>Our hurt, humiliation and disappointments accumulate, but almost always we cannot possibly complain about these to anyone. Our managers would sack us if we told them how we felt; our acquaintances would be horrified by the depth of our insecurities; no one gives a damn about an admirable company that has hurt our feelings through its success. There is no way to take out our distress around geopolitics or economic history or the existential paradox that we are required to make decisions about our lives before we could possibly know what they will entail. We cannot rave at the cosmos or at the accidents of political power. We need, most of the time, simply to swallow our hurt politely and move on.</p>
<p>But there is one exception to this rule: We can rant and moan at a person who is more reliably kind to us than anyone else, a person whom we love more than any other, a blessed being who is waiting for us at home at the end of every new, gruelling day …</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t necessarily always tell our partner that we are causing problems because we are sad about things that have nothing to do with them – we just create arguments to alleviate our distress; we are mean to them because our boss didn’t care, the economy wasn’t available for a chat and there was no God to implore. We reroute all the humiliation and rage that no one else had time for onto the shoulders of the one person who cares most about our well-being. We tell them that if only they were more supportive, less intrusive, made more money, were less materialistic, were more imaginative or less naive, less fussy or more demanding, more dynamic or more relaxed, sexier or less obsessed with sex, more intelligent or less wrapped up in the world of books, more adventurous or more settled … then we could be happy, and our life would be soothed and our errors redeemed. It is – as we imply and occasionally even tell them – all their fault.</p>
<p>This is, of course, horrible and largely untrue. But enfolded within our denunciations and absurd criticisms is a strangely loving homage. Behind our accusations is an inarticulate yet large compliment. We complain unfairly as a tribute to the extent of our love and the position the partner has taken in our lives.</p>
<p>We pick a fight with them over nothing much, but what we are in effect saying is, ‘Save me, redeem me, make sense of my pain, love me even though I have failed.’ The fact that we are blaming the partner in ridiculous ways is a heavily disguised but authentic mark of the trust we have in them. We must be civilised and grown up with everyone else, but with one person on the planet we can at points be maddeningly irrational, utterly demanding and horribly cross – not because they deserve it, but because so much has gone wrong, we are so tired and they are the one person who promises to understand and forgive us. No wonder we love them so much.</p>
<p>We are very alive to the idea that it’s patronising to be thought of as younger than we are. We forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with – and forgive – the disappointed, furious, inarticulate and wounded child within.</p>
