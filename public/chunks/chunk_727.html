        <h2>Adult, Child and Parent</h2>
<p>One of the stranger but more useful suggestions of psychotherapy – and, in particular, a branch of it known as ‘transactional analysis’ – is that all of us contain within ourselves three essential personalities:</p>
<p>•   a child</p>
<p>•   a parent</p>
<p>•   an adult</p>
<p>To flesh these out a little:</p>
<p>The child is typically vulnerable, touching, trusting, weak, in need, incapable of properly looking after themselves and crying out for assistance, tenderness, support, structure and some rules.</p>
<p>For their part, the parent is strong, dominant, in control, responsible but also often chiding, critical, hectoring – and busy from all their cares and duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the adult is sane, thoughtful, in command, neither too weak nor too strong, creative and kind.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we would all be able to toggle between these three personality types with relative ease. In a good relationship, we would constantly be moving between all three roles in ourselves, mostly hovering in the adult zone, but able – when occasion demands – to go into parent or child mode.</p>
<p>For example, when we are feeling sad and under pressure, it should be part of health to know how to become a child again, to show our need, ask for help, curl into a ball, become small and trust that we can be met with kindness and sympathy without fearing attack or belittlement.</p>
<p>Then again, there should also be moments in a relationship, particularly when our usually adult partner has hit a crisis and descended into a child-like mode when we are powerfully able to step up into a parental role and become ministering, indulgent to weakness and tantrums, calm in the face of irrationality and secure enough in ourselves to know that the child-like partner will in a little while revert back to the maturity and self-command that we typically expect from them.</p>
<p>If a couple have small children, then for long stretches both may need to act as parent, but then once the kids are in bed, they might both have a go at being sweet, slightly naughty children, or one might play adult to the other one’s needy younger self.</p>
<p>The difficulty – for couples and individuals – is when people get stuck in particular positions, when they can only ever be children, or only ever parents or only ever adults. There are relationships where, for example, one partner is always the child and the other is always the parent. One person is forever being a bit irresponsible, a bit naughty; they leave their clothes everywhere, they don’t book in for a driving lesson, they don’t go to the dry-cleaner’s, they forget to do the shopping and they lose the keys. They can be highly endearing – when one is in the mood – but you’d hesitate a lot before leaving them in charge. And on the other side of the ledger there is a parental-type partner who is always chiding and reminding the child what to do, who is super competent, forever rather stressed, alternately indulgent to the child but also on the edge of being cross and punitive.</p>
<p>Associated with this can be a deep reluctance on the part of the parental figure ever to access their child self. They always have to be strong; they always have to be mother or father; they cannot go anywhere near being little. They have only disdain for anything vulnerable or seemingly fragile. Everyone says that they cope so well, whatever the situation – but that’s precisely the problem. No one who really copes well copes all the time. Breaking down and being a helpless, defenceless infant belongs to healthy adulthood. There is no such thing as maturity without a constant connection with the immature self from which one has emerged.</p>
<p>Why, we might ask, do people – and therefore couples – get stuck in these roles? Why can it be so hard to move? Why are some people rigidly incapable of feeling their way into the role of child, parent or adult? In all cases, we are – typically – looking at something in the past that has made an easy transition to a particular position untenable or frightening.</p>
<p>There are people stuck in the child role for whom adulthood and parenthood present insuperable difficulties. Perhaps they are the offspring of a loving parent who couldn’t tolerate their own nascent maturity: to be deemed worthy of love, they had to stay baby. However much they might have wished to grow up, they know deep in their unconscious that love and care will only ever be available if they fall into line and continue to be who they substantially were when they were 5, at an emotional level at least. They can either have love or they can have an adulthood – but they cannot have both; such is the cruel stricture under which some of us grow up. They might have been parented by a child-like parent – themselves irresponsible or immature, frightened of sex or unable to fully inhabit the adult world – to whom they had to show unhelpful loyalty, probably because there was no one else in the vicinity who could be at once loving and in command of fully adult capacities.</p>
<p>Or else, one may feel one has to stay stuck in the child mode because a parent would be angry, castrating and humiliating if one dared to show independence and pride in one’s adult ideals. Perhaps a parent was so rivalrous and envious that we learnt to sabotage our potential to be competent and confident so as not to incur murderous jealousy. We chose life over the danger of being cut down by a vengeful, insecure caregiver, but at a price.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, very poignantly, there are people whose younger selves were so badly treated, who experienced such anxiety and lack of support when they were children that the idea of being small, even for a few hours, presents unbearable challenges to their integrity. They may be very happy playing mummy and daddy; they cannot be baby. The very idea sickens them and makes them bristle – though, tragically, they don’t even realise what is going on and certainly can’t connect their nausea with the difficulties of their past.</p>
<p>The route out of all these impasses is, as always, self-exploration and mutual honesty between couples. As we embark on any relationship, we should wonder whether one of these three roles – child, parent or adult – might present an especially difficult prospect (we should pick up on the inner wince or recoil when the thought comes up). And if it does, we should then have the courage to admit as much to our partner; to say, with self-deprecation and calm, that – though we know it might be important to do so – we really have a bit of a problem around being child, parent or adult, but are committed to finding out more.</p>
<p>Problems are never as bad as they might be once we get them into consciousness and circulate them in discussion. To admit to being a child who doesn’t dare to be an adult, or a parent who doesn’t dare to be a child isn’t just a peculiar-sounding confession. It suggests the presence of someone profoundly committed to eventual maturity and on their way to being the best kind of grown-up.</p>
