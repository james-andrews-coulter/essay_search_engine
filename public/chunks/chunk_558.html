        <h3>¶ Avoidant Attachment</h3>
<p>Avoidant attachment is a pattern of relating to lovers whereby, when difficulty arises, we grow cold and distant and deny our need for anyone. We desperately want to be reassured, but feel so anxious that we may be unwanted that we disguise our need behind a façade of indifference. At the precise moment when we want to be close, we say we’re busy, we pretend our thoughts are elsewhere, we get sarcastic and dry; we imply that a need for reassurance would be the last thing on our minds. We might even have an affair, the ultimate face-saving attempt to be distant – and often a perverse attempt to assert that we don’t require a partner’s love (which we have been too reserved to ask for).</p>
