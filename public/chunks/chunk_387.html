        <h2>1. Face the Fear</h2>
<p>Mind, the mental-health charity, has a good, practical down-to-earth pamphlet on phobias. If you do find being alone particularly disturbing or anxiety-provoking, or find other
  people’s enjoyment of being alone distasteful or repellent, it is worth reading this and exploring for yourself if your fears are actually a little pathological
  (www.mind.org.uk/mental_health_a-z/8005_phobias).</p>
<p>To be honest, I personally do not enjoy floatation tanks very much (mainly because I seem to roll over and get a mouthful of vile salinated water; but also because I best like my solitude in my
  house or outside in nature). But I know lots of people who love them. They are available at many beauty and health spas and are a good way of experimenting with being alone in a protected
  environment.</p>
<p>St Anthony the Great (251–356) is generally regarded as the founder of the Christian hermit tradition. He was an Egyptian Christian who went out to live in the desert. He attracted many
  followers. Athanasius (296–373), the Bishop of Alexandria, knew him personally and wrote his biography, The Life of St Anthony, which describes the early adventures in desert
  solitude with sympathy and admiration. It is still in print in numerous translations and editions.</p>
<p>Vicki Mackenzie has written a biography of Tenzin Palmo, paying special attention to her long periods of solitude – Cave in the Snow (Bloomsbury, 1999). In it she discusses the
  value and meaning of solitude in a Buddhist context. Palmo herself has commented that she does not know how Mackenzie managed to make a page-turner out of years of sitting in a small cave
  alone.</p>
