            <h3>Social life</h3>
<p>In the normal course of things, we want friends who are interesting, beautiful, fun and – ideally – prestigious. After failure, the requirements get a lot stricter. What we need first and foremost are people who will not judge, who will not moralise and who will know how to forgive.</p>
<p>There is no single route down which the human mind must go in order to reach this psychological sweet spot, but it’s possible to suggest a likely trajectory. Fundamentally, to accept failure, a person has to have experienced grave suffering at the hands of the dominant societal hierarchy. Something needs to have loosened them from, or rendered them suspicious of, the prevailing status system.</p>
<p>Maybe, at a young age, their particular sort of intelligence was not recognised by the school system. They therefore know intuitively what it is like to be labelled a failure – and how unfairly the tag can be applied. Or perhaps they were at odds with a parent who bullied them or made them feel small for not performing well according to measures that were ultimately arbitrary and disconnected from who they were. Perhaps their sexuality set them at odds with the popular ideals of their communities; they knew that their tastes meant that they could never be simply ‘ordinary’ and lightly accepted. Or, more likely and ideally still, they are people who have themselves slipped up and been exposed. They have known what it is like to wake up one day and have a damning crowd outside the door, to have the internet in flames against them, to be shown the office door after a terse meeting with the boss or to be cast aside by family and abandoned by their social circle. The friends one makes after failure will be those who are fully inducted into the meanness of the human heart. They will have suffered unbearably, been ostracised and judged. They will have spent time sobbing in lonely bedrooms.</p>
<p>Most of us mean to be kind, but we are never punished long or hard enough actually to become so. In the end, ex-prisoners are probably some of the greatest sorts of new friend we can make. There is no more broad-minded set of people on Earth. Their experience wears down all self-satisfaction and arrogance; they are devoid of pride and at the same time, utterly able to recognise our own hunger for sympathy. Maybe at one point they robbed banks or drove getaway cars, but they have the qualities (so long as they are no longer actively involved in crime) to be the gentlest and most imaginative friends. It takes someone who has lost contact with their family and been disowned by their social circle to really understand love. There is no point seeking out ‘good people’ among the blameless and the innocent. We need to nourish our hunger for friendship from richer, more potent sources.</p>
<p>Once we are ready for friendship after a failure, we would do well to seek out ex-burglars and ex-con artists, ex-hijackers and ex-tax evaders. There should be groups specifically focused on connecting those who have failed with this vibrant, redemptive sort of community. Their souls – if we are lucky – will be ready to receive and honour our own distinctive needs for charity.</p>
