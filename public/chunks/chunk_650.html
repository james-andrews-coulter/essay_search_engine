        <h3>¶ Philosophy</h3>
<p>The best way to understand the true purpose of philosophy is to study its etymology. In Ancient Greek, philo means love; sophia means wisdom. Philosophy is the grand name given to the quest to lead a wiser life.</p>
<p>At the start of the history of philosophy, Socrates arrived at a novel approach to wisdom. He believed that a huge amount of suffering unfolds because of our inability to use our minds correctly. We don’t analyse our emotions; we can’t understand our past; we respond with undue haste to certain of our feelings. We haven’t begun to understand ourselves.</p>
<p>To this end, he pioneered the basic tools of philosophy: self-analysis, logical examination, introspection, conversation and friendship.</p>
<p>Socrates was the opposite of a disengaged academic: he believed that the only point of thinking was if it could be therapeutic, if it could help us to be slightly less agitated, confused and sorrowful individuals.</p>
<p>The aim of philosophy was – and still is – to help us cope better with our problems by introducing us to accurate and powerful ideas. Philosophy, as Socrates saw it, could be a School of Life.</p>
<p>This dictionary is philosophical in a precisely Socratic sense: it is a list of ideas strictly selected with regard to their usefulness in our lives.</p>
