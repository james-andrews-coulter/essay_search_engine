        <h3>9We want to stop thinking about love</h3>
<p>Before we get married, we are likely to have had many years of turbulence in our love lives. We will have tried to get together with people who didn’t like us; we will have started and broken up unions; we will have gone out to a succession of parties, in the hope of meeting someone; and known excitement and searing disappointment.</p>
<p>No wonder if, at a certain point, we have had enough. Part of the reason we feel like getting married is to interrupt the all-consuming grip that love has over our psyches. We are exhausted by the melodramas and thrills that go nowhere. We are restless for other challenges. We hope that marriage can conclusively end love’s painful rule over our lives.</p>
<p>Marriage can’t and won’t do this: there is as much doubt, hope, fear, rejection and betrayal inside a marriage as there is outside of one. It’s only from the perspective of singledom that a marriage can look peaceful, uneventful – and enviably boring.</p>
