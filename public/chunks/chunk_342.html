        <h3>6 Scepticism: sensory frailty</h3>
<p>Though we may strive to look powerful and to be in the know, to impress and to dominate, in truth we are at our most endearing when we are strong enough to reveal our vulnerability; when we can admit to all we don’t understand and are blind to.</p>
<p>Aspects of science work to make us more human in this regard because they constantly enforce the message that we are fragile and easily misled beings who have no option but to misunderstand most of what is going on around them. Our touching humanity is nowhere more evident than when we consider, through the perspective of science, the unreliability of our senses. We may think we know what is happening in the world, and for centuries we were very sure indeed of our verdicts, but modern science has served to reveal the scale of our ignorance.</p>
<p>We might be inclined blithely to trust our eyes — but how little of what exists is natively captured by them. Only a narrow band of electromagnetic waves ever registers on our retinas. We miss infrared light at one end of the spectrum and X-ray light at another. For most of history, we couldn’t guess what a fearsome and noble creature a flea might be, until in 1665, the scientist Robert Hooke showed us one from under his microscope at 200 times its real size.</p>

<p>We miss that one dip of a hand net might contain ten million viruses, a million bacteria and a thousand small protozoans and algae — among these the cyanobacteria prochlorococcus, 0.6 micrometres long, collectively responsible (there are three octillion of them on the planet) for releasing twenty per cent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. On a clear day, we can see objects five kilometres away at best. This is why it has been conceptually so hard for us to grasp that Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, is 39,900,000,000,000 kilometres from us, just as it has been hard for us to imagine that there could be forty-three quintillion atoms in a grain of sand, each like a miniature planetary system, with electrons orbiting a nucleus of protons and neutrons, inside of which dwell smaller hadrons, inside of which reside even smaller quarks.</p>

<p>We trust our ears and fail to realise that there is no such thing as silence, just the limitations of what we can hear. We only register sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz and so miss all that is above (infrasound) and below (ultrasound). We cannot detect the sounds of the Sumatran rhinoceros (3Hz) or of air passing over the tops of mountains. We miss the noise emitted by lightning above us and by the harmonic tremor of pressurised magma deep in the earth below us.</p>
<p>Likewise, our understanding of time, anchored as it is within units of twenty-four-hour days and the year it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun, starts to collapse when asked to comprehend that it might have taken 250,000 generations — or a quarter of a million years — of genetic mutation for vertebrates to generate their eyes or that it has been a mere eighty-four generations since Julius Caesar walked the Earth 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Only five per cent of what we call the observable universe is ever captured by our senses. We depend on clever theories for the other ninety-five per cent. We are out of touch with, and perplexed by, pretty much everything occurring around us. We should go easy on ourselves.</p>
