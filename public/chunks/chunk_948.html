        <h3>1Difficulty and imagination</h3>
<p>We often tell ourselves that we keep meeting no one with whom we could possibly go out. Even if we live in a city of millions and have access to billions more on our devices, we are clear about our situation: there is no one out there for us.</p>
<p>We here allege a different thesis. There are plenty of people out there for us, and we have already encountered a range of candidates it would be entirely plausible for us to be with; it’s just that we are unable to see the opportunities. More particularly, we believe – rather wrongly – that there is no one out there ‘good enough’ for us. We feel we could do better, and yet – tellingly – we never do. To shake us from our proud and unhelpful assumption, there are two moves we can make.</p>
<p>Firstly, we should take an honest look at ourselves and wonder whether we really are such deserving, special beings. Our sense of how much of a prize we are often depends on a sense of our pleasing looks or our high status. Here, indeed, we may have a lot to be proud of. But a more fruitful kind of humility – and therefore gratitude and generosity towards our dates – might emerge from considering our personalities. Here there tends to be a veil of silence around our difficult sides. It is in few people’s interests to inform us of quite what tricky types we are. Our parents are too kind, our friends lack an incentive, and our ex-lovers are more likely to have left us with a blithe claim that they needed more ‘space’ or were going to India, rather than explaining how nightmarish we could be. We therefore sally forth with a confident sense of our power to contribute a lot to any relationship and expect to receive ample gratitude from others just for looking their way. We can’t tell that we are, in many ways, real trouble to be with.</p>
<p>We might be a proper pain in a range of ways: we don’t like doing things differently; we don’t like having to back down when we’ve decided on something; we don’t listen very well to what the other person is saying; we struggle to share responsibility; we are demanding, but not good at explaining why certain things are so important to us; we work too much, we have a tendency to scold rather than gently teach; we get worked up about things that other people don’t care about (but don’t seem to notice their boredom).</p>
<p>Excessive self-hatred is a great enemy of relationships, but so too is excessive self-love. Only by realising that we’re not perfect in certain hard-to-see areas can we be liberated to get together with people who are not perfect either; the only kind of people we are ever going to meet.</p>
<p>Realism about oneself leads to a more realistic engagement with others. It helps us compromise constructively around our ideas of who might be good enough for us. Of course, we have got a lot of merits, but we need to compromise because we’re difficult people to be with. We will be a challenge for anyone.</p>
<p>A broadening of options emerges not only from realising our flaws; it also comes from taking a second, more imaginative, look at the litany of flawed potential partners whom we have grown used to dismissing so quickly and ruthlessly. We need to rediscover the role of the imagination in the genesis of love. When our imaginations are switched off, we judge people on the very obvious things about them. We meet someone who is quite nice, but their nose is big. That’s a no. Or they are an engineer, and engineers are unsophisticated. So that’s a no. Maybe they are rich, and rich people are snobs. A no too. Perhaps their hair is thinning and bald people aren’t our thing. No. Or their wrists are knobbly; no. When we’re in an unimaginative mode, we strike many people off the list of possibles very quickly. In this frame of mind, we have a relatively brief tick-list of things that interest (or repel) us. We feel it only takes a moment or two to sum someone up – and fire them.</p>
<p>But what we call imagination means sensitivity to the less obvious things. One scans past the surface and wonders about what else might be going on in a person. They look conventional and a bit formal, but they could turn out to have playful and wild sides too. They look mousey, but maybe they are also very witty around people they know well. They do have a slightly wonky nose, but their eyes are very tender and their lips surprisingly sensual. They have a job that sounds unimpressive, but their interests are very broad and they might be the ideal person to go round an antiques market with. With the help of imagination, we start to engage with quieter virtues that we can’t see if we look head on. Practising imagination is a key to love. In a way it is love, for we all ultimately have to be considered imaginatively in order to be tolerated and forgiven over the long term. By thinking imaginatively, we’re not being disloyal to the true ambition of love; we’re stumbling on the essence of what love involves.</p>
