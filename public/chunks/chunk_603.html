            <h3>¶ Good Demand</h3>
<p>The sort of work that is available to us and the societies we live in are largely the result of an issue that is humblingly small and close to home: what we decide to spend our money on. The combined purchasing choices of millions of people profoundly shape the nature of employment, the structure of remuneration and the distribution of prestige. The term ‘consumer’ capitalism acknowledges that we live in economies substantially defined by what we want to buy.</p>
<p>Governments are used to carefully tracking demand, and panic at signs of its decline. When there is a sharp shortfall, they will move to stimulate consumption so as to ward off dire consequences for employment, tax revenue and investment confidence.</p>
<p>But we should note the extent to which government focus is always on the quantity of demand, not its quality. It is considered more or less irrelevant what people are spending money on, so long as they are spending. They might be buying doughnuts or taking French conversation classes, seeing a psychotherapist or purchasing sports cars. In terms of GDP, unemployment and the stock market, the nature of demand doesn’t matter, so long as the total spend is high.</p>
<p>Yet, in other ways, it matters immensely what we spend our money on, because what we buy determines what kinds of lives we will end up leading and, most importantly, what sorts of jobs there will be; whether they will be degrading or noble, useful to others or noxious. This is where a major statement of value can come in: there is better and worse demand. Demand for guns is less ‘good’ than demand for education. Demand for healthy food is better than demand for its junk alternative. Good Demand might be defined as an aggregate of consumer choices in line with a generous, fruitful understanding of higher human needs.</p>
<p>Good Demand has been elusive because it is so hard for us to identify our higher needs. We are prone to grasping at whatever is blinking most intensely and attractively at us. We are creatures of the herd and will buy what others are buying. We are also surrounded by a hugely active industry that artfully encourages us to want things for its benefit rather than our own. Advertising is founded on our inability to hold on to an accurate picture of our true needs.</p>
<p>Our failures mean that, individually, we may not get the happiness we seek. Collectively, we will end up with a profoundly dysfunctional economy. Raising the quality of demand doesn’t imply a draconian government imposing a high-minded agenda on a reluctant public. In a market-oriented democratic society, change can only ever be voluntary. Altering demand can’t be a matter of forcing anyone to do anything. What we need is the more important, more humane, task of encouraging ourselves to live up to our own highest aspirations in our purchasing choices. The result will be nobler kinds of profit, and fewer dissatisfied and meaning-poor working lives.</p>
