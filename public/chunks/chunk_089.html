        <h2>‘No one loves you or could ever love you’</h2>
<p>That one sounds especially tempting, particularly around three in the morning. Yet it can’t be the truth. You’ve suffered, and you’re honest and you can be kind. That’s enough for someone to stick with you. Most humans love winners, but you don’t need ‘most’ humans. Concentrate on the small subset with very big hearts. Be honest with them about your pain; they’ll find their way to you.</p>
