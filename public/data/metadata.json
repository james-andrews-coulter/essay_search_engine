      "content": "### 1. It\u2019s meant to be easy, but it isn\u2019t\n\nWe are surrounded by reminders that friendship is central to a full and properly lived life: an advert shows us a charming group of people delighting in each other\u2019s company at a beach barbecue; a figure we admire states in an interview that the most important thing in their life is, quite simply, their group of friends; on a Monday morning, a pleasant colleague mentions the great weekend they had with a friend they have adored for two decades who is visiting from overseas; a fascinating article delves into creative friendships between artists \u2026 It all adds up to a beguiling evocation of intimacy and warmth. In a world where conflict and selfishness so often dominate, friendship is held up as the great universally available consolation. It\u2019s a charming, moving vision of the purpose of existence. And it is also, too often, when we can bear to explore the idea, a quietly distressing and tortuous mirage.\n\nOur own experience of friendship tends \u2013 privately and shamefully \u2013 to fall so far short of the ideal. Loneliness continues to hound us; we struggle to communicate at depth with others; we return home from parties dissatisfied and confused. We tell others that we adore them while seldom actually managing to feel more than a tepid alliance. Friendship, which clearly seems very real for others, can somehow appear not entirely available to us. We find ourselves facing questions in the privacy of our own minds that, asked by an adult, can sound painfully naive, even humiliating: how do you make a true friend? What do friends do together? Why can\u2019t I find the friends I want? And we may end up, in the middle of the night, circling a grim existential enquiry: do I actually have any real friends?\n\nThere is no need to make an already painful situation worse. We should draw consolation from a seldom-mentioned but indubitable reality: friendship is neither easy nor natural. It definitely isn\u2019t inevitable. Some of the most sensitive and intelligent people who have ever lived have lacked friends. Many of those who appear highly social in fact harbour profound feelings of communal inadequacy. A lack of friendship usually has very little to do with a deficiency of social skills. The lonely are seldom the peculiar outcasts of popular imagination. Loneliness can coexist alongside an outwardly highly cheerful and easy manner and even \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 alongside the possession of many so-called \u2018friends\u2019. We can be lonely and regularly invited to parties. We can be lonely and receive a lot of messages on our birthdays. We can be lonely and feted as highly social. The lonely may hold their own brilliantly at a party; they might be married, have children and more often than not be out in the evenings. They are not the kind of people who are supposed to be lonely or indeed look bereft and forlorn. And yet they (we) are.\n\nFundamentally the word \u2018friend\u2019 is ambiguous. It points \u2013 in ordinary usage \u2013 to a pretty nice social companion, someone to share a laugh with and perhaps see once a month or so. But it also speaks to something much more tender, fundamental and emotionally sustaining: a sense that in the company of a very special person, we will at last be able to share the most vulnerable and fragile sides of ourselves and be witnessed in our true, unadorned state; we\u2019ll have the privilege of throwing off lies and deceit and be able to say what we really believe, in all its strangeness and riskiness. Another will be able to read us deeply and accurately and will be moved to compassion by our less impressive sides \u2013 and to curiosity by our quirks and passions; what is important in us will meet with what is important in them. In a grander conception of the term, friendship may be as significant and as rare as love.\n\nThis suggests that it may not be any kind of failing that is responsible for our lack of friendships, but rather an uncommon degree of ambition. We are lonely not because we can\u2019t find anyone to spend an evening with, but because we have an unusually expansive and grand idea of what friendship should be about. We are lonely because we are refusing to accept as genuine those cheap, counterfeit images of friendship promoted by a sentimental world keen to disguise the challenges of real connection. Those who feel a lack of friendship most deeply may simply be those who cleave most intensely and sincerely to its genuine promises.\n\nWhen trying to imagine what true friendship might look like, it can pay to explore some of the less familiar byways of culture and history. For example, for a period in early 19th-century Europe, a particularly elevated conception of friendship came to the fore. For a time, friendship was viewed as if it might be an equal to the summits of romantic love. A person might want to die for a friend or justify their life by one.\n\nIn the 1820s, the German artist Caspar David Friedrich painted two men seen from behind, standing alone together on a wooded hill late at night; one lays his arm comfortably on the other\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s clearly an intimate scene. What are they doing? Are they plotting a revolution or the robbery of a local manor house? Is the o\ufb03cial title \u2013 Two Men Contemplating the Moon \u2013 just cultural cover for the portrayal of a clandestine erotic liaison?\n\nCaspar David Friedrich, Two Men Contemplating the Moon, c. 1825\u20131830\n\nIn fact, Friedrich was commemorating in art an especially intense, kind, sustaining friendship he\u2019d had with a fellow painter, August Heinrich, who had died \u2013 at the age of only 25 \u2013 from a lung disease a few years before. He and Heinrich had discussed their craft for many hours; they had sung songs, read each other poetry, shared their dissatisfactions with society and pledged to support and care for one another for life. They had also often gone out and looked at the moon together and bonded over its solemn majesty.\n\nThis starts to hint to us what a true friendship might involve. With a real friend, we might reveal our excitements at small, unheralded but deeply significant things (it could be a love of the night sky, or of a certain kind of music, craft beer or needlework). With a real friend, we might feel as uninhibited as a child around a loving parent. Our souls might thrum in harmony. We might lay a hand or arm on theirs (without anything sensual being meant thereby). We might want to see them all the time \u2013 and even decide to live with them permanently. We might want to share every movement, large or small, of our minds.\n\nWe are \u2013 here \u2013 very far from the idea of friendship as a form of casual bonhomie. Something close to romantic is at stake, and yet it is happening independently of sex. It\u2019s a love not of the body but of the mind and spirit.\n\nOddly, this vision of friendship can seem to be an affront to social convention. Friendship is often represented as a form of collective chumminess: a group of people horsing around, being part of a fashionable crowd. To love the company of one or two people can appear to demote the gang. Real friends can cast a slightly humiliating shadow on what typically, but inadequately, passes for friendship. A culture that wants to promote the notion of having dozens of friends can\u2019t engage with a longing to exit a wide circle and be alone to do something serious and purposeful with just a few special others.\n\nThe best friendships are typically thought of as a matter of luck: one just happens to meet and click with the perfect friend. The classic point of reference for this comes in an essay by the 16th-century French philosopher Montaigne. In his 20s Montaigne met \u2013 quite by chance at a large party \u2013 a young lawyer by the name of \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie. They immediately became \u2018extraordinary\u2019 friends and this lasted, unchanged, until de La Bo\u00e9tie\u2019s miserably early death a decade later. \u2018Why were we such good friends?\u2019 Montaigne asked himself in a famous essay on friendship. \u2018Because it was him, because it was me\u2019 was his unforgettable, tender response. But it is also a very unhelpful answer, for it announces, with intellectual elegance, a passive mystic stance. Do you want a great friend? \u2013 Montaigne seems to be asking. Then wait and hope. There\u2019s nothing to be done except, perhaps, cross one\u2019s fingers.\n\nOur enquiry is more hopeful. We want to replace mystery with logic. True friendship is a skill, not a piece of divine inspiration. Those who find it are not simply lucky: they understand certain crucial ideas; they are guided by specific insights into themselves and other people. And these ideas and insights can be explained and described in precise ways. We don\u2019t have to be born with innate talents for being, or making, a good friend; the capacities can be acquired via the right kind of education. Around friendship we are still, collectively, at the beginning of the kind of frank and constructive conversations we require. Our culture has long evoked the joys of having friends; we now need to talk with greater determination and vulnerability about the delicate and subtle art of making them.",

      "content": "### 2. Why the lonely are especially ready for friendship\n\nThere\u2019s a disconcerting paradox at the centre of our relationships with other people. The individual who most values, and is best capable of, deep friendship is highly likely to be a veteran of isolation, and perhaps of loneliness too. Those best suited for company will probably have spent a lot of time by themselves.\n\nIt sounds bizarre. How could someone truly fitted for friendship not be an easy social mixer? How could the capacity to get on well with other individuals lead to isolation? But in fact there are important contrasts \u2013 and even a fundamental opposition \u2013 between the characteristics that lead to social success and the attitudes that facilitate true friendship.\n\nLet\u2019s conduct a small thought experiment. Imagine it\u2019s a Friday evening and we\u2019ve been invited to a great party. Attractive people are chatting and laughing in large groups and waving to each other across the room; there\u2019s music, plenty of wine and delightful canap\u00e9s; some people are starting to dance. Imagine, too, that we\u2019ve come here as true friendship-seekers; we are, in the background, seeking a rare communion of souls. How would we get on? When we\u2019re introduced to someone, we might want to know who they really are. We\u2019d ideally get them to respond to dozens of questions, many of them about their childhoods, their fears, their secret proclivities and their private hesitations. We would want to enter imaginatively into their reality, in all its joys and sorrows. This might sound like an essential ambition of friendship, but in the context of a party \u2013 that fulcrum of modern sociability \u2013 it threatens to come across as something close to eccentricity. Others are here to cast off the burdens of the day, not sift through the details of their complex selves. They want a pleasant time, not an encounter with their emotional challenges and underlying pains. Were we to deliver a succession of probing questions, our companions might urgently start to scan the room in search of lighter and more \u2018normal\u2019 guests.\n\nSimilarly, were we to begin expounding on our own experiences, we might quickly start to seem eerie or inappropriate. We\u2019d acquire a reputation as an odd type if we embarked on a prolonged attempt to explain just why a holiday in the Languedoc, aged 15, was so decisive for our development, or why a recent divorce had left us unmoored and questioning the basis of our being.\n\nTrue friendship requires time. But the star of the social world is typically quick: they get their funny remarks in faster than anyone else. They are adept at diffusing awkward silences with witticisms; they ruthlessly scan for pauses in the chat. Yet a sincere cast of mind can mean a person will \u2013 and should \u2013 struggle and stumble over the most basic questions. \u2018How was your day?\u2019 someone might ask, and we might fall silent for an age from a sense of the vertiginous gap between what our companions appear able to hear, and our sense of our own convoluted subjective truth (\u2018For hours, I looked out of the window and saw the afternoon sky. I felt anxious for reasons I didn\u2019t understand. I kept on thinking about my 8th birthday party, when my aunt, who \u2026\u2019). The more authentic an answer is, the longer it is likely to take to assemble itself in the workshop of our minds. We might \u2013 as devoted explorers of our psyches \u2013 require three minutes at the very least to be able to say how we are or what we do, by which time our interlocutors will have ruthlessly abandoned us by the peanuts.\n\nThat is why those of us who long most intensely for friendship can end up opting to stay at home. What renders us so good at friendship in theory is exactly what renders us so singularly unsuited in practice for a chat about the weekend or the upcoming holidays. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re inherently antisocial; it\u2019s that social life doesn\u2019t facilitate the kind of deeper interactions that would adequately honour the promises of interpersonal communion. We stay by ourselves because we feel less alone in our own company than we would in an average group of lively and cheerful partygoers.\n\nLong acquaintance with feeling socially lost is precisely what can help us to form our characters in directions that will \u2013 eventually \u2013 render us excellent friends. Periods alone nudge us towards the sort of sustained self-explorations that busier people lack the incentive to undertake and will give our future friends plentiful original material to engage with. Our solitude will have incubated our social lives. Our views on politics or art, psychology or society will bear the imprint of days and nights spent in our own unusual company. Our positions will carry evidence of our independence. Solitude will have lent us a character.\n\nPeople who already have many friends have many advantages. They are free of the self-doubt and fear that beset the solitary, but what they may lack is the ability to properly know and be known by another. We may want many things from our future friends. The most fundamental is that they should probably at some point in their lives have felt very lonely indeed.",

      "content": "### 3. Friendship as a solution to society\u2019s three great false promises\n\nModern society tends to suggest to us that we need three things to sustain us and lend our lives meaning and comfort: a family, a romantic relationship and a good job. It\u2019s an admirable list \u2013 but it\u2019s also, in reality, an extremely di\ufb03cult one to realise and benefit from.\n\nTake family. This should \u2013 according to the adverts \u2013 be an intense centre of kindness and warmth. It\u2019s around our families that we should best be able to be ourselves; here are the people who truly love and understand us; here are the warm-hearted beings who will protect and nurture us. Except, of course, that it is rare for us to leave our families \u2013 at the end of a holiday or on a Monday morning \u2013 without an intense sense of relief at being able to distance ourselves from the claustrophobia, disguised aggression, jealousy and meanness they have mired us in. Measured against their effect on our minds, most families are closer to agents of disintegration and irritation than they are sources of comfort or consolation.\n\nSomething similar holds true for love. Despite the promises of the songs and the films, few people disappoint us as vividly as those we set out to love. The person we come together with will almost certainly fail to be \u2013 as we had fervently aspired \u2013 a blend of helpmate, sexual partner, kindergarten teacher, cook, chauffeur, psychologist, counsellor and bank manager. Time will reveal them to be that most disappointing of realities: a human being.\n\nThen comes work. It is sold to us as a vehicle for growth and self-enhancement. We will, through our labour, become truly ourselves. We\u2019ll find our deepest aspirations mirrored in our status. Our job will tell the world who we really are. Except that \u2013 almost always \u2013 it won\u2019t do anything other than give others a very distorted, often brutal snapshot of our technical merits. The best parts of ourselves seldom make it on to our CV.\n\nIt is against such bleakness that friendship emerges as not merely \u2018nice\u2019, but essential and purposeful too. It is in friendship that we stand to discover what society mischievously suggests we might locate in families, in couples and in the workplace.\n\nHere we can find the support that our families will not give us; here we can discover the tenderness that our lovers don\u2019t normally make available; here we will find the recognition that our professional status is unlikely to lend us across a career. Friendship is critical in defending us against the unwitting meanness of the three greatest myths of modern existence.\n\nFriendship spares us the family\u2019s demented insistence that we must get on brilliantly with certain people simply because we share certain strands of DNA. It liberates us from a lifetime of blaming ourselves for failing to see eye to eye with characters with whom we have nothing in common \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t for the arbitrary fact that they put us on the earth. Friendship recognises our hunger for love and closeness but directs our search away from the incoherencies of biological kinship.\n\nSo too with love. Friendship better honours what love aims at than love itself. It is in friendships that people can finally taste the tolerance, the kindness, the gentleness and the warmth that they may spend decades attempting fruitlessly to locate in their sexual unions. Partly this can happen because we arrive at friendships with intelligently limited hopes. We don\u2019t try to make our friends everything for us \u2013 and therefore they succeed at being at least a few very important things. Friendship ends up delivering the intimacy and security of relationships without their tendencies to jealousy, control, aggression and foul temper.\n\nFriendship knows, too, that our jobs cannot possibly reflect who we really are \u2013 which is why true friends spend little time on what they are up to professionally. That one person has just been appointed director or, for that matter, might have been sidelined in a pay review matters little when two friends are playing table tennis in the garage or chatting on a country walk; these are not the reasons why true friends would have been drawn together in the first place.\n\nWe need friends for many reasons; one of the most persuasive is that we need them because families, love and careers simply don\u2019t work as we are assured they will.",

      "content": "### 4. A friendship audit: am I lonely?\n\nIt\u2019s highly understandable if we don\u2019t generally want to see ourselves as lonely \u2013 and would never want to admit to such a possibility in public. In our world, to be deemed lonely is to be at risk of humiliation and suspicion. Imagine if, for instance, at a job interview, one was asked to describe oneself and replied candidly: \u2018I feel isolated and misunderstood a lot of the time, even when I\u2019m around people whom I call friends.\u2019 The position might swiftly go to someone else.\n\nBut we can approach the question of our loneliness from another angle. What if being lonely was actually a legitimate marker of being an interesting, emotionally sincere and thoughtful person? What if, in a world of superficial alliances, lonely was just what a more serious person tended naturally and legitimately to be? What if being lonely hinted at an ability to avoid superficiality and to build deep and intelligent bonds with select people? An admission of loneliness could then shift from being a troubling sign of social inadequacy to evidence of a noble condition and a promising future. We might \u2013 in a curious way \u2013 end up proud of our own loneliness.\n\nWith this in mind, we might take an unusual test that seeks to probe at the more dignified and generous reasons one might have for being lonely. Loneliness (rightly investigated) should provide a sketch of our potential for friendship: the path to true friendships should pass through an honest reckoning with the deeper, more secret ways we might presently be feeling rather alone.\n\n(i) What do most of your so-called friends not understand about you?\n\nYou might have many friends, but how well aligned are they once you take off a self-protective and sentimental lens? Are there things about you that you try \u2013 tentatively and repeatedly \u2013 to hint at, but that find no encouragement? Is the laughter sometimes hollow? Is there more enthusiasm than any real grounds for it? Are there too many things about you that you wouldn\u2019t dream of mentioning? Be as specific as possible, no matter how odd or seldom-discussed the answers might seem. The challenging element here is to hold on to the longing to be understood despite a latent sadness at not being so; we can get so used to our needs not being met in certain areas that we suppress even the idea of how nice it would be if someone could see us as we really are.\n\n(ii) Who might you turn to if you were disgraced as a result of an error on your part?\n\nIf a large slice of the world were to turn against you, would there be anyone who would continue to see you as you, and not just as the weirdo or loser that society made you out to be? And to turn the screws further: how would this person engage with the fact that \u2013 perhaps \u2013 a degree of blame really did attach to you? Who might see you as both guilty and still worthy of their great affection and kindness? Is there anyone for whom your merits could withstand the public exposure of your defects? And is there anyone you would treat with comparable compassionate grace?\n\n(iii) Who would you be able to tell if there was a big problem in your relationship?\n\nSociety has plenty of time for the romantic troubles of those who are single or dating casually, but strikingly little for the di\ufb03culties of those who are married or cohabiting. Is there someone who you are certain would hear your distress in a spirit of deeply sympathetic patience? What if you had an affair or you suspected your partner was straying? What if love had cooled despite there being three small children in the house? Who would stay with you through the (perhaps) hours of anger, despair or remorse? With whom might you feel free enough not merely to blame your partner but also to express your own share of guilt and dismay at the pain in your couple?\n\n(iv) With whom (if anyone) can you discuss your true insecurities or complexities around sex?\n\nAlthough society \u2013 at least in certain parts of the world \u2013 likes to present itself as immensely open, it\u2019s a radically different matter when it comes to our erotic lives. Often, one may not fit a readily available template of social sympathy: it\u2019s tricky to be an elegantly attired Dean of the Business Faculty who wants to \u2026; a tank commander who \u2026; a mother of three delightful children with a longing to \u2026 Given how judgemental people are, we might not even trust so-called close friends with the details of our true desires. And yet, at some level, we naturally wish we could be seen with tenderness around our more convoluted sensual aspects. We may even have forgotten to call this loneliness.\n\n(v) With whom can you explore your daydreams?\n\nOur daydreams about what our future could be are an important part of who we are \u2013 but they are characteristically detached from practical possibility and can easily sound absurd. To go into detail about a daydream \u2013 about what business we would like to start, or where we would want to live, or how our retirement might go, or what novel we\u2019d want to write \u2013 can require a great degree of indulgence from another person: they have to be willing to enter our imaginative space, to allow that these thoughts are important to us, however whimsical or silly they may initially appear, and that something serious might one day come from a very rough and vulnerable early draft. Is there even one person with whom \u2013 and with mutual pleasure \u2013 you might dare to attempt a disclosure?\n\n(vi) Who likes the idiot in you?\n\nMostly we go to great lengths to keep our stupidities and inadequacies out of sight, on the understanding that (even though we all have them) they would dismay or irritate others. But a true friend would be moved to like us more on account of what\u2019s unimpressive and not so clever about us: the things we have forgotten to do, the daft comments we have made, the inept gestures we are guilty of. Our idiocies \u2013 for our true friends \u2013 would not be fully separable from our merits. These friends would see, and be sweet to, our bursts of exuberant fun, slightly comical preoccupations and moments of gross clumsiness. Who, if anyone, can tolerate it when we are at our least mature?\n\n(vii) Who teases you accurately?\n\nIs there anyone who gently makes fun of you \u2013 not to hurt you but to deliver a reproach that is useful to your own development? Teasing is the best response to the inevitable fact that another who knows us well will and should spot many failings in us and, when they love us properly, should also want to point these out to us with kindness and wit. They should \u2013 with love \u2013 sublimate their irritation into gentle jokes. Getting someone to laugh at themselves is the most useful and thoughtful form that education and feedback ever take. It\u2019s a sign of being truly cared for.\n\n***\n\nThese questions deliberately set the bar for friendship higher than usual. We might \u2013 having surveyed them \u2013 realise that we have very few friends indeed; perhaps even none at all. This is no matter for panic or shame. There are probably many people whom we like and who like us who don\u2019t in fact properly count as friends once we get more ambitious about what friendship should really entail. And yet having acknowledged our present loneliness, we can end up in a better position to begin the di\ufb03cult but rewarding task of going out in search of the profoundly authentic connections we have until now lacked \u2013 and yet sincerely require, crave and deserve.",

What follows is a discussion of nine varieties of true friendship that track distinct ways in which two people can assist each other psychologically.

      "content": "### 1. The confessional friendship\n\nThe tennis match, as always, was a joy. In the club room \u2013 deserted at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday \u2013 Kieran and Salim are having their customary post-match glass of beer. Kieran is bracing himself. It\u2019s a tricky moment. He\u2019s been having trouble in his marriage and only last night lost his temper, shouted horribly at his partner, slammed the kitchen door and started wondering about divorce. Not that he feels justified. He\u2019s terrified it\u2019s all his fault. But can it really just be his fault? He doesn\u2019t know what to think or feel. Is his life unravelling?\n\nAt the tennis club, people are all (it seems) either happily married or happily separated. Everyone is always \u2018great\u2019. And so, when Salim asks, \u2018How are things?\u2019, can Kieran dare to tell the truth? They\u2019ve always enjoyed chatting, but they\u2019ve never ventured into this kind of territory before. Can Kieran risk letting Salim know about what he is suffering? It would be such a relief to discuss it properly, and yet what if Salim was quietly horrified?\n\nWe are required to have two selves. On the one hand there\u2019s the outer, public self that we assiduously curate \u2013 based around the old-sounding but very much current notion of \u2018respectability\u2019: we want, and need, to come across to others as deserving of their approval. And then there\u2019s the inner self: the confusion of thoughts, feelings, impulses, longings, regrets, fears and phobias we know ourselves to be.\n\nThis gives rise to a tension that can grow to alarming proportions. The \u2018respectable\u2019 self has to edit out so much that is really going on, and causing trouble, below the surface. The \u2018respectable\u2019 self can\u2019t be open about any of the following: what sex is really like for us; the ways in which we tend to self-sabotage; the extent of our self-loathing; what we are ashamed of in our past and what we feel guilty about in the present; what our childhood was actually like and the things or people we in fact hate, in the face of a seeming social consensus that they are to be approved of or admired. The gap between who we feel ourselves to be and who we feel we have to be looms ever wider. It can feel impossible to be liked and understood at the same time.\n\nWe are always secretly scanning others, hoping to discern some hint that they may be more receptive to the less respectable (but psychologically central) parts of who we are; we make little probing initiatives \u2013 things we can back off from if need be.\n\nWhy has Kieran thought of Salim as someone who might understand? He has been touched by a kind of gentleness in his on-court rival. They\u2019re pretty evenly matched and Salim is very competitive, but when he loses he always goes out of his way to say how much he enjoyed the game; there\u2019s a delicacy to it \u2013 a desire not to sully Kieran\u2019s victory by being a sore loser. It\u2019s a microscopic hint, but it\u2019s still a hint. Here is someone who is saying it might be OK to lose; despite trying one\u2019s hardest. Failure needn\u2019t be a humiliation.\n\nSo, when Salim asks the customary \u2018All well?\u2019, Kieran utters the fundamental opening words of intimacy: \u2018Not so good, actually.\u2019 It can sound like such a tiny move and yet one might go for years without making it. He doesn\u2019t blurt everything out in one go. He tentatively mentions a di\ufb03cult argument; he suggests he needs to make a decision. There\u2019s no detail, no great confession, just the quiet implication that there\u2019s so much more to be said.\n\nFor Salim, it\u2019s not entirely easy to respond. How should he meet these words? He could close it off with a polite formula of indifference: \u2018It\u2019ll all blow over; it always does.\u2019 But instead he takes the answering risk: he lets out a low, empathic \u2018mmmm\u2019 and murmurs, \u2018Tell me \u2026\u2019 And gradually Kieran begins to unfold the trauma of last night, and what led up to it.\n\nWhat we forget, as we gear ourselves up to take the first confessional step, is the longing on the other side: Salim has his hidden troubles too, but he has been paralysed by fear of what his nice acquaintances might think of him if he were to be open about them. Kieran\u2019s vulnerability is a signal he\u2019s been waiting for.\n\nNot this afternoon, but over time, Kieran\u2019s confession offers Salim permission (which he stands so much in need of ) to start to confess the very different but equally real burdens he\u2019s been secretly labouring with: his estrangement from his highly successful brother; his shame at having \u2013 as he sees it \u2013 made so little of the wonderful opportunities life has offered him.\n\nReciprocity is psychologically crucial. It\u2019s not merely that one sees the compassion in another\u2019s face, but that one discovers that the other is just as muddled, fractured, hurt and confused as we are. The dial of normality is reset. The lonely sense of being freakishly awful is more accurately interpreted: we are simply like others are on the inside. We are suffering from a powerful illusion of what everyone else is like; and now \u2013 thanks to friendship \u2013 reality and self-perception can be more sanely aligned.\n\nThe conversation at the club was a few months ago. Kieran and Salim still love playing tennis together but relish, even more, the chance to talk at length about certain tricky things after the game.\n\nA confessional friendship meets our need to be understood and liked at the same time.",

      "content": "### 2. The friend who balances us\n\nAmongst the less expected of historical friendships is one that developed during the 1960s between two cultural figures who were almost crazily different: the cerebral poet T.S. Eliot and the anarchic comedian Groucho Marx.\n\nIn 1961, Eliot, who was obsessed by tradition, decorum and obscure references to Dante and was now in his 70s, wrote a fan letter to Marx \u2013 world-famous for his irreverent, slapstick humour. It was a bid for friendship. Marx responded warmly and the two became important to one another in the few years before Eliot\u2019s death.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a matter of dated celebrity gossip. It\u2019s a moment when we can glimpse what we ourselves might be looking for in friendship. There\u2019s a huge tendency to assume that friends are like one another; that we want and need to be around those who share our experiences and our outlook. But Eliot and Marx are charting a different approach. Philosophically, the question is: why might we want and need to be friends with those who aren\u2019t like us at all? An answer lies in a submerged problem of every life: the extent to which we become one-sided and over-invest in a part of our nature at the expense of our true potential. We may seek in friendship to correct our imbalances of character; to locate in another the missing piece of ourselves.\n\nGroucho Marx at a press conference, 1964\n\nT.S. Eliot, c. 1959\n\nGroucho (born in Manhattan in 1890) had, in his di\ufb03cult, financially strained childhood, wished to become a doctor \u2013 that is, to master the most socially respected body of knowledge he could imagine. In fact, he had to leave school at the age of 12 to help support his family.\n\nTom (the \u2018T\u2019 in T.S.) was born into a distinguished and wealthy family, in which high intellectual achievement was a central path to recognition and acceptance. He was often ill as a child and \u2013 though he may have wanted to run around and be naughty \u2013 he spent most of his time sitting quietly and reading.\n\nThe inner specialisation we feel psychologically required to undertake leaves many aspects of who we might be undeveloped. We are, in fact, stunted, though the world may be very ready to reward the limited, constrained guise we have adopted.\n\nMarx\u2019s delirious capacity to render everything absurd was nothing like the whole of who he was, just as Eliot\u2019s refined presentation was only an aspect, brilliantly developed, of who he might have been. In friendship Tom and Groucho were looking for balance. They were seeking to reconnect with the parts of their personalities that had been neglected or sacrificed in the pursuit of success.\n\nWe can even see the problem in their art \u2013 great as it is in both cases. Eliot really would be an even greater poet, and a more powerful force in the world today, if he could have more surely inhabited the normal ground of unrefined, unerudite experience: Marx\u2019s home territory. His specialisation in obscure references perhaps weakened rather than strengthened his poetic talent. And Groucho may have less to say to us today because pure physical comedy, to which he gave so much of his life, grows stale, while his evident capacity for the witty skewering of di\ufb03cult truths (\u2018I don\u2019t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member\u2019) was occasional and scattered.\n\nWe\u2019re not great poets or hugely successful comic actors, but in our own way we may suffer the same kind of trouble: we too lack balance in our lives. We\u2019re hard-working at the expense of enjoying life; we\u2019re hedonistic to the detriment of our careers and relationships; we\u2019re hyper-responsible (which ends up annoying lots of people) or not responsible enough (with the same result). We\u2019re not to be blamed. We don\u2019t have to punish ourselves more for our internal biases, though we might long to find an exit from them.\n\nIt\u2019s not weird, therefore, that there can be a draw in friendship to those who, ostensibly, are so different from us; we see in them, if only in the dimmest outline, the needed correction to our own one-sidedness. The slightly brutal irony is that society tends to be suspicious of such friendships: its vision is that like should comport with like. The person in their 70s may hugely value a friendship with someone in their 30s \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 because each finds in the other a counter-force to their own anxieties. The older person is returned (despite all their fears) to a sense of relevance; the younger is given a much-needed longer perspective. But the world doesn\u2019t openly welcome such connections and in no way is set up to foster them.\n\nSomeone who is quite shy could perhaps find no better friend than another who is very confident socially \u2013 someone, that is, to correct their exaggerated anxiety around others. And the devoted socialite might rather urgently need a friend to understand, appreciate and encourage their quieter, more thoughtful side. But often we can\u2019t even imagine this happening. It\u2019s one of the tragic misapprehensions of existence: we assume that others are looking for more of the same. There\u2019s a pervasive reluctance to think that poor and rich, left and right, scientist and artist, super-sporty and elegantly languid might \u2013 at the level of friendship \u2013 crave one another.\n\nIf, like T.S. Eliot, we were to take the first step and write a fan letter to a very unexpected (but psychologically needed) person, who might it be? Who would it be lovely to be friends with not because they are like us but because they supply what\u2019s missing in us?\n\nWe pretty much always know \u2013 secretly \u2013 the excessive price we\u2019ve paid to survive; we know where our imbalances lie, though self-respect may make us reluctant to own up to them. But what specifically is suppressed? What\u2019s missing? Typically it is the opposite of what we\u2019re good at. This isn\u2019t an attack on our merits but a reminder of the excess cost we paid in acquiring our specialised excellence. We\u2019re finely diplomatic because we\u2019ve slightly run away from being (at times when it\u2019s needed) more directly confrontational. We\u2019re so ambitious because we\u2019re hiding our longing to be cherished for our own sake. The different other comes in as the friend of the abandoned parts of who we are.\n\nGroucho and Tom were sketching the outline of a better world, achieved through a better psychological balance in ourselves. As it happens, they didn\u2019t entirely pull it off. In the end, they slightly irritated each other. But the value of their example doesn\u2019t lie in them getting it perfectly right. They are showing us what we long for.\n\nA balancing friendship meets our need to discover in another the missing parts of ourselves.",

The friend who teases us\n\nNadia, as happens not infrequently, has just texted to suggest a different nearby place to meet \u2013 and to announce she\u2019s running \u2018circa twenty-seven minutes late\u2019. It\u2019s not literally unbearable of course, but it does irk Ilya, even though he\u2019s very fond of her. So, he texts her back \u2026\n\nLet\u2019s home in on a peculiar \u2013 and significant \u2013 problem with being human: we\u2019re thin-skinned. We hate being criticised. We can\u2019t stand having our defects pointed out directly. Yet, so obviously, we all have defects that we\u2019re not good at detecting for ourselves but that others can instantly spot. Inevitably, there are harder truths we need to hear. Together these two facts create one of the most maddening paradoxes of the human condition: there are really important, di\ufb03cult things we should understand about ourselves and that we are really bad at taking on board and doing anything about.\n\nIlya writes: Very dear Madame Turgenev, I\u2019ll be so honoured to greet your beautiful spirit whenever it alights in any cocktail bar on planet Earth.\n\nTeasing at its immature worst means mocking things another can\u2019t do anything about. But there\u2019s a more artful, adult version, in which humour is recruited to sweeten the task of correction.\n\nThis is one of the great works of friendship. Teasing, between friends, responds to the huge moral conundrum: how to deliver an awkward truth in a pleasant way; how to get the target of a criticism to embrace a lesson without feeling humiliated.\n\nNadia will understand. She and Ilya were both fans of Turgenev\u2019s novels when they studied together in Grenoble; the celebrated 19th-century writer was notoriously hard to pin down for social occasions and had a habit of being late for everything. But at the same time it\u2019s not really very hurtful to be compared (even in a failing) to one of the finest literary stylists of, as they like to call it, the Bourgeois Epoch.\n\nOne doesn\u2019t say, \u2018You are awful.\u2019 That gets nowhere. And yet the objection must be launched. Ideal teasing wraps the critical barb not in flattery but in authentic appreciation. It finds the point of reference that\u2019s alluring to the other but that can still communicate dissatisfaction. The best teasers make their affection for, and appreciative understanding of, us entirely plain in the same breath as they pinpoint a failing. The best teasing is mutual.\n\nIlya \u2013 it can be fairly said \u2013 sometimes shies away from stating clearly what he thinks; if Nadia asks him what he thought of a film or a book, he\u2019ll hedge his reply; she\u2019d love him to be a little more forthright. It\u2019s not horrendous, but it\u2019s annoying to Nadia, because she really wants to meet his authentic views. At such moments she\u2019s taken to calling him the Professor of Prevarication. The barb \u2013 stop beating about the bush \u2013 is enfolded in the playful intellectual flattery of a high-sounding academic title; he\u2019s enticed to greater directness rather than shamed for his di\ufb03dence.\n\nThe world is littered with the corpses of friendships that died because two people couldn\u2019t tease one another effectively. In utopia, \u2018how to tease well\u2019 would be one of the key areas of academic study and of education.\n\nA teasing friendship meets our need to find someone who can alert us to small but real defects without hurting us so much that we run away.",

Roberto and Jamal give each other a hug after a wonderful evening and jump into different taxis. It will probably be at least a couple of weeks, and maybe longer, before they meet face to face again; they\u2019ve been good friends for a few years and always relish their times together, talking intensely for three or four hours before going their separate ways.\n\nAccording to Romantic ideology \u2013 as it evolved from the late 18th century onwards and has come to dominate modern thinking \u2013 friendship is a kind of failed relationship: true love means wanting to be with someone all the time. The fact that Roberto and Jamal only see each other occasionally is, by this standard, second-best. Jamal\u2019s romantically inclined sister thinks it\u2019s a great pity he never got together with Roberto and that they would have made a great couple.\n\nScenario two\n\nIt\u2019s just gone 11 p.m. and the last customers are leaving the restaurant. Roberto and Jamal get silently into the same taxi, heading home together. They\u2019ve been married for three years; they both like the idea of going out to dinner, hoping it might rekindle some of the intensity of their early days, but often they end up just talking through the routines of domestic life or co-ordinating their diaries \u2013 and not infrequently enduring long silences, perhaps because so many matters have gradually become contentious between them.\n\nAccording to a more Classical tradition of thought, one of the glories of friendship is that it is a part-time occupation. It\u2019s not merely practical limitations of time and opportunity that restrict how often Jamal and Roberto get together: there\u2019s an underlying wisdom. From the Classical perspective, what we really appreciate and delight in the other gets swamped by constant exposure to the things we don\u2019t like about each other. To be loved for what\u2019s best in us, a degree of distance may be necessary.\n\nAs friends, much of what the other is like doesn\u2019t actually matter. As friends, it\u2019s irrelevant that Roberto tends to leave milk cartons in the fridge well beyond their use-by date, though if they were together full-time, this attitude would infuriate Jamal. And Roberto doesn\u2019t care that Jamal colour-matches all his books, though he\u2019s slightly stunned to see the reality \u2013 a guide to restaurants in France next to a copy of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason because both happen to have red covers. And this is only to begin the list of matters over which they would contend were they to try to share the whole of their lives. Meeting only in restaurants, they can concentrate on the specific, and very real, things that delight them about one another.\n\nIn artistic terms, a friendship can be likened to a beautiful sketch. A great portraitist might capture a key aspect of someone in a few lines; it\u2019s not that they were too uncaring or too lazy to record every detail \u2013 they weren\u2019t trying to do that. They wanted to immortalise a glance, a posture, a tilt of the head, a way of gesturing. To be a friend is to be a sketching artist: it is to select out of all the things one could concentrate on what it is best to concentrate on.\n\nIt has to be admitted, though, that even in the limited arena of a restaurant encounter, with the comforts of a langoustine salad and a glass of Chablis, there are still irritants. Roberto winces slightly at the sight of Jamal\u2019s floral shirt and Jamal has to hold his tongue when Roberto mentions, in all seriousness, someone\u2019s star sign.\n\nThere\u2019s a rather specific character to minor irritants: their power to drive us crazy depends on their frequency. A small frustration stays just that \u2013 small and bearable \u2013 if it is met only at well-spaced intervals. The problem is constant repetition. An occasional gust makes a tree bend, but then it comes back into shape and continues to grow upright; a constant wind distorts the entire structure.\n\nIn the two or three weeks they have apart, Jamal and Roberto easily regain their mental suppleness and can meet afresh. Neither is overburdened, or hurt, by the shortcomings of the other. They can afford to overlook a small failing (as each sees it) to which they are rarely exposed.\n\nTheir friendship is deeply important to both of them \u2013 one of the loveliest things in their lives. And yet they have maintained their love for each other so well and for so long because their encounters are brief, occasional and intensely apprehended.\n\nAn occasional friendship meets our need to be loved for our own merits, without our failings getting in the way.",

Every Wednesday, Niamh travels across the city to knock on Ian\u2019s door around 7 p.m. Niamh does the supper; always simple, always more or less the same. The menu, however, isn\u2019t the point. They meet like this because over the next few hours they will do something that \u2013 in both their experience \u2013 is painfully rare: think together.\n\nWhat makes it even more strange is what they think about. They don\u2019t wrestle with prestigious intellectual problems: how does the material brain generate the first-person experience of consciousness? Or, how can the theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity be reconciled? Rather they think together about seemingly minor issues.\n\nA whole evening might be devoted to thinking through what\u2019s nice about driving at night or why Joan Armatrading\u2019s \u2018Heaven\u2019 is so moving. They might think about what makes for a genuinely good holiday or why Noga, a mutual acquaintance, is so hard to get on with. These might not be academically prestigious lines of enquiry (no university departments are devoted to studying them); they just happen to be highly relevant to the lives of Niamh and Ian.\n\nSuch matters sound pretty simple. But they are strangely hard to get to grips with. The answers seem easy \u2013 until one tries to spell them out to another person. Our brains, in fact, are far from perfect thinking machines; they are beset by various flaws, and the role of the thinking friend is to help us overcome these obstacles. For one thing, there\u2019s a huge tendency to rely on words that express enthusiasm (or rejection). We say, \u2018That was great\u2019, \u2018lovely\u2019, \u2018so nice\u2019, \u2018quite boring\u2019, \u2018so annoying\u2019, etc., but we give no detail: what actually about that thing (or person) is lovely or awful? And why does it, or do they, have this particular effect on us, given that they don\u2019t strike everyone as they strike us? The thinking friend pushes for clarification. Their desire to know more about our experience \u2013 to understand its granular character and the personal reasons behind it \u2013 is the stimulus we need to go into detail. And when we do, we discover ourselves. The thinking friend doesn\u2019t combat our opinions and responses; they want to understand them deeply.\n\nThen, the mind has an ingrained habit of wandering off topic: talking about one thing makes us think of something else, which jogs our memory about yet another thing. We may have started off talking about why a passage in a novel is so moving, and two minutes later we\u2019re onto an anecdote about self-service checkouts at the supermarket. Without embarrassment, the thinking friend pulls us back into focus.\n\nWe\u2019re not offended, we\u2019re happy to return, but we needed their pleasant but precise reminder.\n\nThe thinking friend helps us overcome the natural, and debilitating, tendency of the mind to stay within certain self-imposed limits: we have a hypersensitivity around what we are or are not supposed to think, which blocks the path to what could be our more productive insights. Timidity disguises itself. An individual who seems intellectually very confident and bold may be constantly shying away from simpler, more straightforward ideas \u2013 even when these are really quite sensible and wise.\n\nThe joy of the thinking friend is that their (inevitable) mental timidity isn\u2019t the same as ours. They can spot when our thinking is being driven by a determination to arrive at a predetermined and, to us, safe conclusion. It\u2019s their company that makes us feel we could risk thinking differently.\n\nAnd they keep us going when, left on our own, we\u2019d simply give up. A basic principle is that the mind panics when a task seems to be taking longer than it should. A car trip that was supposed to take half an hour becomes a nightmare if we\u2019re still on the road after four hours. But with a lot of things, we have no realistic sense of how long they \u2018should\u2019 take. Should it take five seconds \u2013 or five hours \u2013 to work out why you find a painting charming? The thinking friend encourages us to keep going (and we them). They project the sense that it is worth continuing to wrestle, expand, clarify, revise, summarise, revise again. In their company the task is allowed to be as demanding as it really is.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that it\u2019s a friend we are thinking with: we need their curiosity about us, their desire to understand us, their enthusiasm for what we might discover and their esteem even while we are struggling to articulate our ideas. The cumulative result \u2013 after months and years of thinking together \u2013 is a deeper engagement with our own thoughts and feelings; a sharper, more evolved sense of what we really think and feel, want and need, care about and like.\n\nA thinking friendship meets our need for another to care enough about our emerging ideas to help us know our own minds.",

      "content": "### 6. Microfriendships\n\nIn the large block of apartments, Ester occasionally bumps into Shanaya in the lift. In a formal sense they\u2019re not properly friends: they haven\u2019t been in each other\u2019s homes; they don\u2019t know each other\u2019s history. But they always smile warmly, say hello and ask how the other is getting on \u2013 even if they know that the answer will have to be squeezed into the few moments it takes for the elevator to reach the ground floor.\n\nTaking time to have small chats about nothing in particular with people we don\u2019t know and may not ever get to know fully can \u2013 from some perspectives \u2013 seem like the height of absurdity. Maybe we\u2019re in a coffee shop and someone is preparing us a drink. Or we\u2019re on a train, waiting for the doors to open. Why would we bother to hold up our day for a few moments, given how many things we already need to do and how many good friends we have who we haven\u2019t seen in far too long? We may also have a more high-minded defence for our silence: we aspire to be profound people and there is no way that we can get anywhere meaningful with a near or complete stranger in a compressed amount of time. We shun the smaller chats because \u2013 in the back of our minds \u2013 we tell ourselves that we are already deeply committed to the long and consequential ones.\n\nBut this is to miss the point \u2013 and the opportunities \u2013 presented by minor social exchanges. They stand, in relation to lengthy friendships, rather as haikus do next to 1,000-page novels; there are things a tiny poem can do that a comprehensive narrative will miss. There are single sentences that can mark us as much as entire volumes. There are pictures that can stick with us in a way that a three-hour film won\u2019t. We can be disproportionately and yet powerfully touched by so-called minor things.\n\nWhen Shanaya says she\u2019s fine, there\u2019s a look on her face and a tone in her voice that communicates a great deal more; the way she says \u2018all is well\u2019 really means: \u2018I\u2019m OK, but I know how complex life really is. OK will do as a summary, but I\u2019m so aware of the hidden complexities in my life and, I guess, in yours too.\u2019 And Ester can hear \u2013 and appreciate \u2013 the wider resonance. They may never elaborate beyond this, but some important acknowledgement has passed between them.\n\nSmall, sympathetic chats matter above all because few of us are ever very far from sadness and despondency. There are so many reasons to dislike ourselves, to be paranoid about what other people think and to regret mistakes we\u2019ve made. When we are in a febrile or fragile mood, a short, kindly exchange can be all that is needed to start turning around a deeply dark day. An enormous amount of sympathy and fellow-feeling can be compressed in the most minuscule dialogue. \u2018They make them like that to torture us, don\u2019t they?\u2019 we might say to a parent struggling to close the zip on a child\u2019s jacket in a sudden downpour, thereby sending a modest sign that we know how di\ufb03cult things can be \u2013 and that we have in some ways been there, or somewhere like there \u2013 ourselves.\n\nOr we might, on our way to a station, exchange one or two sympathetic words with a taxi driver about their elderly mother who, we learn, has just gone into a care home after having a fall. The chat won\u2019t change anything in an already tricky situation, but the humanity on display might notch up another argument for hope. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer observed that we can never know for sure who around us may, at any particular moment, be thinking of ending their own life. The thought usefully puts into relief what might be at stake in any exchange; we may \u2013 at points and without any obvious warning \u2013 be the last barrier between someone and a decision to despair.\n\nA charge often made against small chats is that we can surely only ever be pretending to be friendly. Yet this is to miss out how much, and how deeply, our hearts may go out to people whose lives we merely brush against. We can imagine our way into pains whose details we will never know. We can \u2013 paradoxical though it sounds \u2013 love a stranger. And, even more oddly, for only a minute or two.\n\nWe are so often held back by unhelpfully grand ideas of what it means to change the world. We imagine the requirements for improvement on such a large scale that, along the way, we end up grievously neglecting what it is actually in our powers to achieve right now, today, the next time we are out. We suffer from an upside-down view of where significance can lie. We are assembled out of small things \u2013 and may live or die by their presence or absence. We have in our hands a very potent weapon already: the power to say a warm, gentle, sympathetic hello.\n\nA microfriendship meets our need to sense that our complex humanity can be recognised by complete strangers.",

A friend to be silly with\n\nJasmine and Sigrid have a particular game that\u2019s been evolving for a while between them; it started when Jasmine had been binge-watching Pingu, the TV programme about a little penguin who speaks a fabulous made-up language, with her daughter. Now the two 40-year-olds have immensely serious-seeming discussions in their own version of nonsense. The topic will be something like the first moon landing. Full of nail-biting intensity, Sigrid will do the countdown \u2013 botti, sin, solo, weewoo \u2013 then theatrical awe \u2013 strodo tintoe, leepa leepa proudy fleebydom.\n\nA problematic point that needs to be admitted from the start is that we are all in our hearts irremediably silly. We are lots of other things too: serious, noble-minded, generous, hardworking, loyal, intelligent \u2026 and yet all the time we are on the verge of damaging everything (in our own eyes) thanks to the occasional but massive eruption of our essential idiocy. One said that to someone at a party; one walked straight into a glass door; one says \u2018one\u2019 idiotically often. We are so aware of our own foolishness. We are so grievously cut off from that of others.\n\nToday Jasmine (divorce lawyer) and Sigrid (hydraulics engineer) are mock-analysing Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy. It calls for frowning stares as they wrestle with huge assertions: weary job fog, chatty nainai [agonised pause to confront the imaginary insight] chimp dump sinner ordo poop shack. It\u2019s all terribly silly \u2013 and a delightful bond.\n\nThe silly and the serious are not, as we tend to suppose, enemies. The more beautifully refined, cultured and well-presented we are, the more we need open silliness in our lives. Because, ironically, the more anxiously we guard our dignity, the more fragile it becomes. The glorious sign of security is that we know perfectly well that we can be both wise and fools at the same time. There are few sweeter things than witnessing an elegantly accommodating response to human ineptitude: the perfectly attired individual who laughs (and invites others to join in) when they spill a cocktail down their gown; the premier or president who is tender and humorous and kindly helpful when the mortified waiter drops a tray.\n\nBehind the scenes we hold ourselves together; we keep our private madness and incapacity secret as best we can. But what we fear is that others will realise that \u2013 despite our talents and successes \u2013 we are very, very silly individuals. The ideal silly friend is someone who normally presents as serious and in control but who is willing to be idiotic with us.\n\nJasmine and Sigrid have taken aim at an existential target. When in a plenary address to the National E\ufb03ciency Forum Sigrid lightly mispronounces the word \u2018focus\u2019 (it comes out as \u2018fuck-us\u2019), she\u2019s not abashed. When Jasmine, with an over-enthusiastic gesture, flicks her bundle of notes onto the floor of the district court, she reacts with good-humoured aplomb. No one now can possibly see them as more ridiculous or more nonsensical than they have \u2013 blissfully \u2013 acknowledged themselves to be.\n\nWe need the notion of inoculation. We take a manageable dose of a malady and it reinforces our capacity to cope with the worst, full version when it comes. We acknowledge, in the safety of friendship, how far we are from being the rational, perfectly capable creatures of our fantasies, and the public revelation of the inglorious truth arrives not so much as a humiliation as an extension of a familiar joke. And so, we respond to our stumbles and follies with the modest grace and good humour that is amongst the sweetest and most loveable answers to the conundrum of being human.\n\nA silly friendship meets our need to happily acknowledge, and thus disarm, our secret understanding of our own existential idiocy.",

      "content": "### 8. The old friendship\n\nA quarter of a century ago, Xavier and Khendra were assigned to the same halls of residence in Edinburgh; they were close friends for four years, then life took them quite separate ways. Xavier lived in London for some years; Khendra worked in many countries before making Los Angeles her home. More recently they are both back living in Scotland, though on different sides of the country; their lives are very different. Khendra, who is single, is a political advisor in the Scottish Parliament; Xavier runs a chain of wholefood shops and has recently started a family with his husband, James.\n\nThey still very much like to get together occasionally to reminisce.\n\nPsychologically speaking, ageing is a deeply ambiguous process. We almost certainly become more competent, and we like to think we become wiser. But there is also what might be called the wisdom of youth that we stand to forget, which is why reminiscing \u2013 which can sometimes sound mawkish and delusional \u2013 deserves a philosophical rethink.\n\nConsider the fate of probably the most prosperous artist of the 19th century, Sir John Everett Millais. In his later life he made a huge fortune; his single most commercially successful work was a painting called Bubbles. It shows a curly-haired little boy (in fact, his grandson) blowing soap bubbles; it\u2019s technically very skilful, but no one can claim it\u2019s addressing anything much. It was, however, massively taken up by the large and ambitious Pears soap company as the centre of an advertising campaign. It became perhaps the best-known contemporary image in the Western world.\n\nJohn Everett Millais, Bubbles, 1886\n\nThe problem came when, in a gesture of homage, Millais\u2019 fellow artists put up an exhibition of his early work, the best of which he hadn\u2019t seen for many years. The elderly Millais \u2013 rich, celebrated and knighted \u2013 was confronted by who he had been as an artist: less polished, more urgent, caring nothing for popularity yet eager to ennoble the public. Over the years, his early insights and aspirations had been submerged in the alluring worldliness of celebrity. His style had become smoother, but his aim was less true. He wept, it is said, in shame. Millais, we may say, had not reminisced enough. And he had, we know historically, largely broken with his old friends. He\u2019d lost touch with what was wonderful about who he used to be.\n\nXavier and Khendra aren\u2019t artists, but together they are keeping the wisdom of their youth alive as they age. For this it\u2019s not su\ufb03cient merely to retell externals: the way it used to be possible to rent a student flat in the Royal Circus \u2013 now a plutocratic abode; the curious fact that there used to be more direct flights between Edinburgh and Venice, not that that particularly mattered to them then. What they do instead is push each other for psychological detail.\n\n\u2026 Remember how you got really interested in writing poetry, and used to put quotes from who-was-it up in the kitchen? Why was that so nice? What might it have become? What would be the version of that today?\n\n\u2026 How did you feel about your parents then? I sort of forget, but I don\u2019t recall you talking much about them. How has your perspective on them changed?\n\n\u2026 You were so unsure about what to do. Didn\u2019t you apply to work in a bank and have ideas about living in a croft? What was going on? Can you still feel in touch with the confused parts of yourself?\n\n\u2026 Why was it that we were thrilled to be sleeping in a flea-pit hotel in Paris? (Remember the bathroom with the door that wouldn\u2019t close?) Why can\u2019t we be excited that way now, instead of so concerned about upgrades and toiletries?\n\n\u2026 When we cleaned up after that party (the one where Imran wore that jacket) with ABBA belting out \u2013 why was tidying up such fun?\n\nIt\u2019s not that our younger selves were perfect. But in the experiences we had then, we can find so much that is nice, complicated and interesting about our own nature \u2013 some of which may not be nearly so much in evidence today. These aspects of who we are have been pushed aside by the demands of later life, but they stand \u2013 always \u2013 to be rediscovered and reanimated. We need the old friend who was with us then and knew and shared the truths that once were more visible.\n\nAn old friendship meets our need to keep alive the best of who we used to be.",

The ideal gang\n\nGustavo, who has come straight from a board meeting, is lolling on the sofa saying something to Genevieve, whose gentle face is opening into a delighted smile, while Jo \u2013 who plays acoustic guitar in a band that hasn\u2019t quite made it \u2013 is leaning over the back to share the joke. Noticing them, Frederika, engaged in telling Atticus something crucial about the philosophy of Spinoza, glances up and winks at Cynthia, knowing how she\u2019ll be touched by the sofa moment. They are all friends. Jo, who dropped out of university after three months, goes swimming with Frederika (MPhil, DPhil); years ago, Genevieve was Cynthia\u2019s favourite babysitter; Atticus is Gustavo\u2019s dance instructor. But it\u2019s best \u2013 and wonderful \u2013 when they are all together.\n\nIn films we often meet the gang in its least elegant guise: a bunch of criminals intent on a heist. But even there the allure is tangible. To find oneself part of a group of friends, so different amongst themselves but all united by deep ties of affection (and with no plan of robbery), would be utterly lovely. But it\u2019s sadly so rare; it can feel like something merely for a utopian novel, impossible in our own lives.\n\nThe ideal gang invites two questions: first, why is it so especially appealing? And, second, is there anything we can do to make it less rare? How, in other words, might we form a gang of our own?\n\nThe starting point, as so often, is to understand a fear \u2013 namely the anxiety that often grips us when two very different friends, who we know quite independently, finally meet. The worry isn\u2019t simply that they won\u2019t particularly hit it off: it\u2019s quite reasonable that not everyone is going to like everyone else. It\u2019s rather the anxiety that they will see something horrible and disturbing in each other. In the vignette with which we started \u2013 which is a disguised description of a real group of friends \u2013 Cynthia was very fond of both Gustavo and Genevieve for years but long dreaded the idea of their meeting each other. Gustavo is wealthy, sophisticated and, in a business setting, can come across not merely as decisive but as impatient and demanding. Genevieve, the former nanny, is extremely sweet-natured but rather innocent and naive. Cynthia worried Gustavo would dismiss Genevieve as a dull, timid provincial \u2013 with nothing whatever to offer anyone over about the age of 6; he\u2019d be (Cynthia imagined) disturbed to think of her wasting her time with this unprepossessing non-entity. And Cynthia was horrified at what her beloved Genevieve might make of Gustavo: she\u2019d be too nice to say anything nasty, but in her heart she\u2019d be saddened and alarmed that Cynthia was keeping company with such a harsh, soulless character.\n\nThe meeting did happen, eventually, at Cynthia and Frederika\u2019s wedding. Gingerly, they sat Gustavo and Genevieve as far apart as possible. But it was incredibly touching, late in the afternoon, to see them dancing together. Gustavo was being his nicest possible self \u2013 funny, gentle, kind \u2013 and he\u2019d clearly brought out a long-buried touch of naughtiness and daring (by her standards) in Genevieve. And this was the start of the gang.\n\nA child\u2019s life involves many divorces, in a wider sense of the term. There was a \u2018divorce\u2019 between Cynthia\u2019s parents and her grandfather of whom she was very fond when she was little. He had run a double-glazing company; he was jolly, direct and, in her parent\u2019s eyes, an embarrassment. They didn\u2019t even need to say anything; Cynthia could sense her father\u2019s shame when his father praised a dinner as \u2018a slap-up meal\u2019, whistled to indicate surprise or took to wearing a cowboy hat. Cynthia felt she was being asked to choose: would she join her parents in their distaste of his \u2018vulgarity\u2019, or would she keep faith with her warm grandfather (who did occasionally call her parents snooty)?\n\nIt was this fear that resurfaced around Frederika\u2019s friend Jo. Jo wasn\u2019t at all superficially like Cynthia\u2019s grandfather \u2013 he shared a satirical attitude towards \u2018the posh\u2019, which in his eyes would certainly include Gustavo and, in fact, Genevieve as well. For, despite her lack of money, Genevieve has a delicacy and refinement that, Cynthia was sure, Jo would dislike. And Jo could definitely come across as rough. She saw his deep vein of tenderness \u2013 the ease with which he could be moved to tears \u2013 but many would be more struck, and turned off, by his bluntness and studded leather jacket.\n\nBut again, a miracle. Both Gustavo and Genevieve took to Jo. And then they all embraced Jo\u2019s friend Atticus and four had become six. The power of the group lies in its ability to close our emotional wounds. The kinds of people we\u2019d learnt, very painfully, couldn\u2019t be close, turn out now \u2013 in the personae of our group of friends \u2013 to embrace one another warmly. The splits in our own soul are being cured.\n\nCynthia\u2019s story, however, contains a troubling element: it is highly dependent on chance. It could so very easily not have happened. She speaks, in purely secular terms, of miracles because it is essentially so improbable that Gustavo would delight in Genevieve and that both of them would take to Jo and then to Atticus. This is what explains the rarity of such groups.\n\nTo fight against randomness and chance we require art. The arts, broadly understood, are humanity\u2019s attempt to deliberately create good things rather than wait upon accident. The art of irrigation overcame dependence on random floods or down-pours; the art of construction liberated us from the sheer chance of finding a suitable cave in a convenient place; the art of poetry seeks to provide a more stable supply of eloquence and insight.\n\nAround groups, the art in question is that of making an introduction. Usually this is an abrupt affair, hardly more than a name or a single, hopefully interesting, fact: \u2018\u2026 from Uruguay\u2019 or \u2018\u2026 who I met when I was an intern at Reuters\u2019.\n\nBut properly understood, an introduction is a huge thing. At its best, and most expansive, it is the attempt to teach one person how to love another. Some of the greatest novels are attempts, on the part of the writer, to introduce us properly to, and show us how to appreciate, a character who we otherwise perhaps might not much like. The entirety of War and Peace can be read as an extended introduction to the central character, Pierre; as if Tolstoy were with us at a party and said, ushering forward a very stout, rather complacent-looking individual, \u2018I\u2019d like you to meet my friend Pierre, who \u2026\u2019 and then recited the entire 1,000-plus pages of the book. And, at the end, we would be utterly delighted to embrace Pierre and take him into our hearts.\n\nIf Cynthia had thought about it, she might have tried the grand strategy of proper introduction. Right at the start, long before Gustavo and Genevieve met, she could have begun introducing them to each other. Little by little she\u2019d have described to Gustavo how kind Genevieve had been as she was growing up; she\u2019d have portrayed her dignity and explained her shyness. She would have searched in Gustavo for points of emotional contact. Did he have a sweet teacher at primary school? Could he imagine how nice it was for her, when she was little Cynthia, to snuggle up to such a quietly comfortable person? She\u2019d transmit her love for Genevieve to Gustavo. It might take months or years. And she\u2019d do the same for him to her, gradually quieting her understandable fears of such a formidable figure. The good introduction doesn\u2019t shy away from a person\u2019s more forbidding or disturbing aspects. Rather, it makes sense of them. And so, when they were finally to meet, it wouldn\u2019t be an intensely anxious moment: it would be the joyful recognition of two people who had already learnt \u2013 from a distance \u2013 to understand the charm Cynthia saw in each and, now, to see it in the flesh for themselves.\n\nThe truth is that beautiful gangs needn\u2019t actually be as rare as they are \u2013 the right art, if we can learn it, can set us free to be happy together.\n\nFriendships within an ideal gang meet our need to close the unnecessary distances between those we love.",

An absence of shared challenges\n\nWe tend not to pay much attention to the striking fact that most of our friends are acquired at very particular stages of our lives \u2013 for example, at secondary school and university, or on long, physically demanding trips, or during our early years in a new company, or after having just had children.\n\nWhat these diverse situations have in common is eventfulness. Friendships develop when things are intense, involving peril, beauty, jeopardy, drama and self-development. We cement friendships when we have to confront the same sadistic teacher who sets us too much homework; when we have to spend all night in the library cramming for an exam that threatens to determine our whole futures; when we need to negotiate a hot and chaotic bus station at the foot of the Andes; when we have to struggle together to make sense of a mysterious o\ufb03ce hierarchy or need to figure out how to feed a newborn.\n\nIt\u2019s not inherently strange that friendships should spring up under such conditions: these are today\u2019s equivalent of primordial tasks like building shelters, hunting animals and grinding corn together. What\u2019s remarkable in the modern world is how we have forgotten the importance of activity in trying to generate friendships.\n\nFor example, the favoured locale for the nurturing of new friendships tends to be a bar or a restaurant, where we can be guaranteed to face no greater shared tasks than sipping a beer or asking for a bill. What has, in all likelihood, preceded a challenge-free Saturday evening encounter is a rush to get as much done as possible so as to clear time, as we see it, for the higher business of a quiet chat.\n\nWe\u2019ve probably strenuously got all the real work out of the way in the preceding hours from a sense that we would otherwise have irreparably damaged our chances of fostering mutual sympathy. We might have spent a whole afternoon doing the laundry, being perplexed by the instructions for a flat-pack bookcase, rushing around the supermarket or dropping in on our much-loved but rather di\ufb03cult mother. We might then talk about our hurdles later in the restaurant, but it rarely occurs to us to actually share these hurdles with our companions in real time.\n\nAnd yet, if we were properly attuned to the preconditions of friendship, we might decide to invite our friends to meet us in the supermarket and take them on a pressured gallop down our shopping list. We would task them with helping us to find the dishwasher tablets and the paper towels; and they\u2019d reveal to us how they balanced their weekly budget and what kind of chocolate biscuits or pretzels they were drawn to. If things were going really well, we might take them home and bond over the laundry. It can be hard to claim to know anyone before we\u2019ve gone through a wash together. However interesting it can be to discuss an acclaimed new film, it may be a lot more meaningful to go through a pile of freshly tumble-dried smalls. And though it can be revealing to discuss how impossible our parents are with a friend over dinner, it is a great deal more effective to take our friend to meet this mother so that they can witness her fascinating blend of tenderness and hostility in action.\n\nWe\u2019ve got things backwards. We struggle alone with the real but important business of our lives and then carve out a few deeply unrepresentative placid moments in which to survey recent events. In a wiser society, we\u2019d set out deliberately to involve our friends in our challenges and labours. We\u2019d create opportunities to see each other flustered, laughably frustrated or surprisingly resourceful in adversity. We would bond over small, shared wars against shopping trollies, Allen keys, wrinkled shirts and awkward family meetings. We don\u2019t need to stop talking to friends, but \u2013 if we really want to grow close \u2013 we might need, far more than we realise, also to begin urgently doing something with them, perhaps starting with the laundry.\n\n2. Presumptions of normality\n\nOne of the great hurdles to developing deeper friendships is the assumption that, in order to prove acceptable to other people, we need \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 to come across as extremely normal.\n\nIt\u2019s on this basis that we devote an uncommon amount of energy to hiding away all the sides of ourselves that we feel sure would horrify and revolt other people: our hesitations, our sexual quirks, our self-doubts, our neuroses and our moments of panic and despair.\n\nWe live in a world that continues to imply that reasonable people might exist. Even as, at an intimate level, no one has ever yet met such creatures.\n\nTo acquire friends, we have to make our peace with a perhaps remarkable-sounding idea: that it is normal \u2013 and even very sensible \u2013 to find life unbearable. We have crises not because we are strangely incapable of living, but because we are \u2013 all of us \u2013 inevitably at points overwhelmed by the plain unreasonableness, cruelty, senselessness and arduousness of existence.\n\nReal friendship is not so much threatened by disclosures of vulnerabilities and compulsions as built out of them. It is impossible to become a close friend to anyone until we have dared to induct them into our less-than-impressive aspects; until we have been brave enough to display the full scale of our waywardness and our idiocies. We may awe strangers with our strength, but it is only once we dare to present them with our frailties that we are in any position to turn them into sincere allies.\n\nNineteenth-century Romantic culture had a lot of time for emotional eccentricity. There was a recognition that \u2018genius\u2019 could at times be aligned with outbreaks of what was plainly referred to as \u2018madness\u2019. Talented scientists, poets, artists or philosophers were more or less expected to lapse into the odd demented moment: they might run weeping out of meetings, try to maim themselves, mess up their finances, rant or refuse to get out of bed for a month. But no one panicked because it was understood that certain very good things about these people \u2013 their extraordinary sensitivity, authenticity, creativity and insight \u2013 would also naturally throw up some more socially uncommon periods.\n\nThe error of the analysis was only that it was too narrow. It\u2019s not in truth only scientific or artistic paragons who should be given leeway to go off the rails. We are all of us entitled to sympathetic interpretations of those less conventional instances when we are driven to distraction by a frenzied world and the momentous contradictions in our own natures.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, 1889\n\nEveryone is inwardly distressed. Most of us keep our potential madness at bay, but we are perfectly well aware that it is there. We should not be scared off by our own turbulence or mistakenly assume that no one could like us if \u2013 with a few precautions \u2013 one day we revealed our multifaceted reality. We should not continue to lock ourselves into our loneliness from a ruinous belief that no one could witness us and keep faith with us.\n\nBy making peace with our true selves, we will also be doing others a great favour; we will simultaneously be encouraging them to befriend their own exiled parts. A friend \u2013 in the highest sense \u2013 is a select person who is alive to, and has been allowed to see, the collapse of another\u2019s respectable facade. If we never allow this to happen, if we are immensely careful never to be exposed at our worst, we can acquire a reputation as a solid-seeming person and even be celebrated as a grand and impressive one. But we will also \u2013 paradoxically and painfully \u2013 be closing the door on one of life\u2019s most nourishing and sustaining gifts: a sense that we have been fully seen by someone and, blessedly, remain liked.",

      "content": "### 3. Shyness\n\nOne of the great errors we can fall into when we set out to make friends is to trust that the way people first present themselves to us \u2013 in those tense early moments at a party or in the workplace, in a holiday resort or a lecture hall \u2013 is the sum total of who they are.\n\nWe start to get shy and unnecessarily inhibited when we assume that a social front \u2013 a construct marked by a blend of seriousness, optimism, stiffness and fakery \u2013 is the truth about what other humans are actually like; when we side with the outward presentation of others over what we know of ourselves, namely, that we are within our depths all highly vulnerable, silly, funny, weird, desperate and sad creatures longing for affection and never far from chaos.\n\nWe cease to be warm or authentic when we double down on efforts to fit in with a model of decorum to which we see others subscribing. We get locked into interactions in which everyone\u2019s presentational self is taken by others to be the truth of who they are. Everyone lies and, even worse, everyone gets taken in by everyone else\u2019s lies \u2013 and eventually even their own.\n\nOften, no one is having a good time in their relationships \u2013 and yet somehow everyone colludes to suggest that there might be such a thing as happy love. Everyone is miserable at work and yet everyone is busy sharing stories of their latest triumphs and progress, and thereby denying public recognition of the universal compromises and pains of careers. Everyone is breaking down in tears and crying wildly into their pillows at night, and yet still the chatter is about options for happiness and success. In a more minor key, everyone is sitting down for a tedious three-course meal when, in reality, it would be so much more fun to cook some scrambled eggs and go dancing.\n\nThe person who founders in friendship goes along with the lies. They assume that what they feel has no echo in others. They imagine that other people inside are the way they come across outside. They don\u2019t keep faith that these companions have just fallen into a straightjacketed way of living and are longing to be released, if only they knew how.\n\nOn the other hand, the bold acquaintance, the person with a natural manner and a gift for friendship, uses themselves as a guide to social reality and conduct. They know that they are bored at the dinner party \u2013 and dare to guess that on this basis many other people will be too. They know that the prizewinning novel was pretentious and they have the wherewithal to assume that they won\u2019t be the only ones to feel this way. They operate with the idea that most of what is going on in them will, despite an absence of immediate evidence, be going on inside other people too. They know they cannot be the exceptions; they refuse to trust \u2013 where it counts \u2013 in their own originality. They know that their madness and silliness, playfulness and impatience belong to everyone.\n\nTheir honesty can lend them a gift for comedy. They smoke out others\u2019 secrets when declaring their truths \u2013 and generate relieved laughter in the process. They say that they fancy the president or the shopkeeper and everyone giggles because their own unacknowledged desires have been tickled along the way. They express hatred for a fashionable political cause \u2013 and allow everyone to admit that they have long felt this way too.\n\nLike a shy person, a socially liberated one knows they are odd. Where the latter differs is in being sure that everyone else is as well. The art of making friends is based on a sure sense that others are not as alien as they might seem; on losing some of our shame and more boldly picturing that our unusual-sounding insides have corollaries in strangers; on accepting that we are, in the best and most redemptive of ways, far from unique.",

      "content": "### 4. The fear of having nothing interesting to say\n\nWe are often held back in social life by a feeling that we can have nothing very interesting to say \u2013 chiefly because nothing especially dramatic ever happens to us. We may have a quite ordinary job; we seldom travel; the outward circumstances of our lives are settled. On this basis, we can end up assuming that we won\u2019t especially be able to intrigue or delight anyone, and so we may fall rapidly silent in interactions.\n\nWhat this unfortunate line misses is that there is no such thing as a boring life, only a life that has been unfairly interpreted and narrated, perhaps by its owner. The clearest evidence for this is the extent to which some of the greatest works of art \u2013 they might be paintings and novels, films or comedy shows \u2013 are woven out of everyday, undramatic cloth. They involve nothing grander than ordinary men and women stumbling through daily realities \u2013 but these become promptly fascinating (funny or intellectually deep, beautiful or moving) because they have been presented to us with special receptivity and insight. The works of Vermeer and Jane Austen, Larry David and Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and Lady Murasaki (to cite just a few examples) are resolutely fashioned out of so-called \u2018ordinary material\u2019. There are no great military exploits; no one is especially distinguished or legendary; nothing much \u2018happens\u2019. And yet the works of art that result are some of the most compelling that have ever been made \u2013 proof that what makes a life gripping is not so much what objectively occurs in it as the way in which it is explored and told. The most seemingly ordinary event \u2013 a daydream at the window, an interaction with a child, a walk in the park \u2013 can become a topic of hilarity or majesty when it is handled with due respect and imagination. Our lives are already as interesting as we ever need them to be, so long as we can accurately honour their true contents.\n\nThe American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked: \u2018In the minds of geniuses, we find \u2013 once more \u2013 our own neglected thoughts.\u2019 In other words, geniuses don\u2019t have thoughts that are in the end so very different from our own; they have simply had the confidence to take them more seriously. Rather than imagining that their minds are only a pale shadow of the minds of infinitely greater thinkers who lived and died elsewhere long ago, they have been respectful enough of their existence to conceive that one or two properly valuable or vivid ideas might plausibly choose to alight in the familiar aviary of their own intelligences. Thinking is \u2013 in a way we generally refuse to imagine \u2013 a truly democratic activity. We all have very similar and very able minds; where so-called \u2018interesting\u2019 people differ is in their more confident inclinations to study them properly.\n\nEvery life \u2013 our own included \u2013 is, properly understood, immensely complex and moving. We read, we think, we observe, we have an intricate emotional history; we love and hate and hope and fear. It cannot be true that we are essentially uninteresting. We only ever unfairly lose faith in our inalienable capacity to interest others.\n\n5. The belief in simplicity\n\nOne of the saving graces of relationships is that they are broadly understood to be very complicated things indeed. People appreciate that couples will constantly end up locked in disputes and tensions over apparently innocuous things \u2013 and may then need to spend an inordinate amount of time working their way through their differences, perhaps with the help of a psychotherapist or a mediator. It doesn\u2019t surprise anyone when a couple has a major stand-off because of the way one of them does (or doesn\u2019t do) the washing-up, or says the word \u2018please\u2019, or behaved around their aunt at supper. Wearily, we understand that living with a partner is an awesomely intricate business and \u2013 on a good day \u2013 we are willing to give this intricacy the respect and the time it requires.\n\nFriendship, on the other hand, can find us more optimistic, less guarded \u2013 and more blithe. We assume that, here, things will at last be relatively easy, largely on the basis that \u2013 quite often, for a while \u2013 they indeed are. Friendships are meant to be the generous, kind and fun part of life. We come here with an expectation of ease and emotionally unburdened interactions. Not for friends the ponderous self-absorption and obsessiveness that we know from couples.\n\nExcept \u2013 of course \u2013 it rarely works out entirely this way, paradoxically, especially in those friendships that are particularly valuable and worth preserving. The more a friendship deepens, the more likely we are to stumble upon many of the same issues that complicate relationships. But here, unlike in love, we are bereft of an ideology that can render us appropriately patient and respectful of the shoals we\u2019ve hit. We\u2019re fatefully convinced that we need to be breezy and light precisely where \u2013 now \u2013 we should allow ourselves to be cautious, compassionate and committed to painstaking exploration. We wind up torn between an impulse to have our case heard and an impression that we surely shouldn\u2019t be so \u2018heavy\u2019 in this arena.\n\nWe should not make our lives more complicated than they need to be by insisting on an illusory simplicity. The human mind is one of the most sensitive \u2013 and easily bruised \u2013 organs in the cosmos. In the course of our social lives, however serious and apparently dignified we are, we are likely to be impacted by some of the following:\n\n\u2022 A friend who, at the end of messages, is uninclined to end matters with the \u2018xx\u2019 we privately expect and always give them.\n\n\u2022 A friend who never asks about our health, though we always remember to address the kidney issue or backache they mentioned to us last year.\n\n\u2022 A friend who insists on meeting on Tuesdays though they know that Thursdays are marginally easier for us.\n\n\u2022 A friend who keeps alluding \u2013 in a quiet but significant way \u2013 to the wealth differential between us.\n\nOur belief in the \u2018ease\u2019 of friendship contains a hidden fragility: unlike in love, we feel we are not allowed to scream across the room and tell a friend they\u2019ve betrayed us. We can\u2019t, like an ardent partner, say that we hate them right now and want out. We can\u2019t \u2013 most significantly of all \u2013 dissolve our frustrations in generous and passionate acts of love-making.\n\nIn the worst case, we end up having to walk away from someone we are fond of because we\u2019re unable to tell them that \u2013 for a time at least, in order subsequently to recover sincere affection \u2013 we need to hate them quite a lot. The alluring idea that friends should never criticise one another ends up undermining the very friendships we most value.\n\nWe need to remove the pressure on individual friendships to be devoid of tensions. We should conduct all our friendships under a general, socially endorsed notion that \u2013 naturally \u2013 the more we get to know someone, the more issues will crop up. The more there will be resentments and points of contention and the more we will need to rely on artificial-sounding resolution mechanisms to dispel grievances without either side being made to feel that something has gone irrevocably wrong.\n\nOne suggestion is that \u2013 without anything significant being understood by this \u2013 good friends should regularly air between them the question: \u2018Tell me, what have I recently done to annoy you?\u2019 Significantly, the enquiry shouldn\u2019t probe whether or not one has annoyed the friend; the starting assumption \u2013 far less pejoratively \u2013 is that naturally one has done so (because every good friend does) and one simply needs to know the details.\n\nWith good cheer and an absence of paranoia or despair, one might point out to a friend that one was a little irked by a recent email; the friend might then respond by recounting a sensitivity raised by one\u2019s attitude to time-keeping or to boasting about one\u2019s promotion. Each person would welcome a complaint as evidence that their friend was taking their connection seriously; an inability to come up with any offence might seem like a sign that one was either being dishonestly sentimental or didn\u2019t like one\u2019s friend enough to acknowledge their power to perturb one.\n\nWe start to properly value our friendships when we grant that they are often every bit as tricky \u2013 and every bit as worthy of being rescued through analysis and discussion \u2013 as our most meaningful love stories.",

      "content": "### 6. Envy\n\nFriendships that begin harmoniously when two people are at similar points in life are always vulnerable to the pressures of diverging fortunes: someone\u2019s novel takes off; a business booms; a promotion is proffered. Or, conversely: a career flatlines; there\u2019s a redundancy; a scandal breaks. The success of the one then becomes intensely resented by the other, who cannot look on their formerly equal friend\u2019s new advantages without contortions of sickness. Far more than we\u2019re usually prepared to admit, all friendships are at risk of envy.\n\nIn strongly individualistic and competitive societies, this can feel like a tragic truth. The highly successful and socially well-connected American essayist Gore Vidal once summarised the problem with legendary arch emphasis: \u2018Whenever a friend of mine succeeds, a small part of me dies.\u2019 The bleakness comes down to statistics: because the chances of one friend growing more successful over time than the other in some way must be close to 100%, all friendships are \u2013 in this disenchanted worldview \u2013 condemned gradually to wither.\n\nThe challenges are real, but they are not beyond thought or remedy. Firstly, we should never compound matters by assuming that envy might not exist, or wonder for too long whether we\u2019re imagining that it might have arisen. Those silences, missing questions and distant looks mean exactly what we suspect they do. We shouldn\u2019t presume that any bond might be without at least an important degree of this ubiquitous feeling.\n\nAnd the reasons are self-evident. We tend to be friends with people who share our aspirations and values, and it is therefore highly likely that at some point along our journey together, either they will acquire something we very much want, or vice versa: it might be a partner, a profession, a qualification or a home. But it will be something for sure. We envy people for the same reason we are friends with them: because we like the same sorts of things.\n\nWe are unhelpfully inclined to be sentimental and therefore dishonest on this score: we deny that we could possibly harbour envy for someone we also like, which can lead us to unconvincing denials and cuts off opportunities for processing and growth. We need to learn to feel better about envy, in order not to have to twist our characters to avoid admitting to it.\n\nWe should, with reasonable good cheer, simply own up to our envy as we would to a sore knee or an ulcer. Children can be good guides in this area: an average 4-year-old is comedically open about their ravenous jealousy. They don\u2019t contort themselves into knots in the name of politeness. They wail immediately when their friend gets a better fire truck \u2013 or try to hit them over the head or gouge out their eyes. Parents tend to be so shocked by this that they force the child into fruitless denials. They inspire them to hide their envy from two people: the person they\u2019re envious of and, far worse, from themselves. They implicitly teach their offspring a pernicious and untrue idea: that you cannot both be a nice person and envy something your friend has. And therefore, tragically, in adult friendships, neither party is left able to call out the problem sensibly or deal with it maturely, leaving it to fester in embarrassment instead.\n\nThis brings us to the second solution to envy in friendships: we should go in for mutual playful, non-pejorative moments of confession. All good friends should \u2013 in an entirely good-natured way \u2013 routinely discuss the presence of envy between them. The question shouldn\u2019t be whether or not there is envy, just what sort of envy it might be this week. Friends should, for example, over dinner each write on a sheet of paper: \u2018What I am envious of now \u2026\u2019 and laugh with great compassion at the results.\n\nAn important part of the reason why we don\u2019t process envy as we might is that we imagine there can be only one solution to the emotion: that the person who has something that their friend lacks will have to hand it over. But of course, we can\u2019t be expected to surrender our partner, our house or our position nearer the top of the company to make a friend feel better. However, that\u2019s not remotely necessary, because what the person who envies us really wants is not, in the end, our love life or accommodation or profession. What they want is reassurance. They want to know that we still love them despite our new advantages. They crave to be told that though we have won the lottery, sold our shares or found a dazzling lover, we remain deeply attached to them and care for them as much as we ever did.\n\nDeep down, the pain of rivalry masks a fear of abandonment. When we are in the weaker position, our terror is that the other \u2013 in the glory of their new success \u2013 will stop caring about us. They\u2019ll start to pity us, to look down on us and to want to shake us off. We\u2019re no longer worthy in their eyes (we imagine) of close association with them. These are genuinely horrifying thoughts. But it\u2019s crucial, at this moment of fear, to ask ourselves how we would feel about them if the situation were reversed. Suppose we ended up with a lot more money or prestige than them; would we relish making them feel hopeless? Would we want to crush them? On the contrary, we\u2019d be rather desperate to make sure our friend knew as securely as possible that we saw them just as we always did, that we loved them for reasons that were unaffected by promotions or money. We then need to remember that if this is true of us, it will also be true of our friend. One person may have made a fortune by launching a business, the other may subsist on busking (let\u2019s imagine), but between the two money is not the mark of worth; it is, as it always was, their conversations about books, childhood, the complexity of being alive, their responsiveness to nature and art, their sense of humour. True friends don\u2019t take their cues from what others may think. They evaluate (and deeply respect) each other on a different \u2013 and far better \u2013 scale of values than that crudely utilised by markets and employers.\n\nAnother major defence that protects friendship from being eaten alive by rivalry is \u2013 oddly \u2013 pride. To feel the force of this idea we need to abstract, for a moment, from the particular relationship in which rivalry is rearing its head and think about our wider attitude to relationships. Suppose one day someone who is very impressive and successful were to get interested in us and extend an open and benign hand of friendship. We\u2019d be deeply proud to count them amongst our closest companions. We\u2019d relish that despite all the demands from the wider world and the great opportunities that constantly came their way, they wanted to talk and spend time with us; they wanted and valued our views and ideas; they liked and greatly appreciated who we were. This wouldn\u2019t be humiliating; it would be wonderful. At root, this is no different from continuing to be a close friend to someone who achieves conspicuous success during the time of our acquaintanceship. We deserve to be proud of them, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 proud of ourselves for being friends with them.\n\nOwning up to our true longing (and hearing it appeased) is devilishly hard for reasons we\u2019re now in a position to appreciate: because the envious person can\u2019t admit to what they\u2019re feeling; because there aren\u2019t generally any good occasions on which confessions can be made \u2013 and because we aren\u2019t collectively schooled in the art of offering reassurance to others in the wake of our successes.\n\nIn a better world, we would take greater care. As a matter of course, every time something went well for us, we would be sure to add in ample reassurance that \u2013 despite our new status \u2013 we continued to love and cherish those we had long loved. We should stop worrying that there might be seams of envy entangled in our friendships and focus instead on a far more important goal: learning to handle envy with kindness, honesty and well-apportioned doses of warmth and humour.",

The di\ufb03culty of imagining the loneliness of others\n\nOne of the reasons why we tend not to make friends as often as we might comes down to a powerful background idea whose full destructive force we may not even be aware of: the belief that any decent person already has all the friends they need.\n\nSomewhere in our minds, the notion has been lodged that only very sad and inept people would \u2013 at this stage in their lives (whatever stage one happens to be at) \u2013 still have a space in their social agenda for a new entrant. Everyone else \u2013 anyone worth knowing, anyone talented, interesting and good \u2013 would long ago have acquired the gang to which they are now continuously and irredeemably wedded.\n\nWhat this idea misses is the extent to which loneliness and disenchantment are ongoing and universal possibilities, and not limited to those of reduced appeal and capacities. Right now, the enchanting actor is (despite the crowds) lonely, as is the feted concert pianist, the renowned biologist, the skilled airline pilot, the miraculous neurosurgeon and that rather nice-looking person you have just spotted in the corner of the room laughing animatedly with a group of fashionable companions.\n\nAnyone of sensitivity and charm might fail to find the right sort of allies, outgrow their friends from school or university, land on uncongenial spirits at work and spend a lot of evenings on their own, either physically or spiritually. And we can know this for certain of other people because we know it, first and foremost, from a very reliable source: ourselves.\n\nWe need to battle the part of our minds that reads our isolation as a selective punishment and vanquish it with evidence available directly from our own experience. Other people who know us almost certainly find it hard to imagine that we are lonely and that we\u2019d like to locate a wise, tender, funny and interesting new friend, and it\u2019s statistically improbable that we would be outliers in this respect. What holds true for us must and will hold true for others.\n\nWe have built a predominantly cold and guarded society by imagining a thesis that we know to be untrue on the basis of our own experience. We have allowed self-hatred and shame to cloud our judgement and reduce what is in fact a universal a\ufb04iction and possibility to the status of a personal curse.\n\nThe next time we spot an interesting person, we should disregard our initial assumption that they have all the friends they need.

      "content": "### 8. Too many friends\n\nOne of the more unexpected reasons why a person may end up not having any friends is, paradoxically, because they have far too many already.\n\nAs friend-abundant people, we may seem like the last people to suffer from feelings of abandonment and forlornness. We might be invited out all the time; there may have been 23 people at our recent birthday party and there might be 123 of them attending our forthcoming wedding. Our phones might constantly buzz with new messages and we may not have been home for an evening on our own for two months. We don\u2019t seem like candidates for loneliness. And yet, this is precisely what we could be, not because no one knows us but because everyone knows us. We have been surreptitiously driven to loneliness not by an absence of friends but by a crippling and ongoing plethora of them. We are lonely not because we are alone but because company has stripped us of opportunities for the sort of focused intimacy required to dissolve the more stubborn roots of isolation.\n\nWe have ended up in this confusing space in part because of an ambiguity in our societal understanding of what a \u2018friend\u2019 might be. At a popular level, the term seems to refer to someone we catch up with once or twice a year, whose job and relationship we vaguely understand, around whose arm we often place our own and whom we greet with great affection and a momentary longing for sincerity at large social gatherings where music makes it hard to speak.\n\nBut at another level, the word \u2018friend\u2019 also refers to someone who is never more than a phone call away, someone we spoke to this morning and whom we\u2019ll be in touch with again at lunchtime and then once more again before evening, someone who understands us as well as a lover or a parent, someone whom we adore as much as a sibling, someone who would be there at our hospital bed at the end and for whom we would \u2013 in extremis \u2013 be ready to lay down our lives.\n\nIt\u2019s a failure of language that both these sorts of people blithely carry the same title \u2013 but the confusion is more than linguistic. It causes us in practice to forget what we might best do with those we like.\n\nWe might assert \u2013 in sharp contradiction to the messages of society \u2013 that it is impossible to have many more than three proper friends. Four would be a maximum. At five, something has gone wrong. And by the time we invite over a hundred people to our wedding or can fill a restaurant for a birthday (even a landmark one), we have traduced the concept of friendship entirely.\n\nReasons that go beyond the financial or the physical explain why people tend not to have more than a few children. It appears impossible to maintain the sort of close emotional bonds that both parties crave once the numbers rise. We know that someone could not possibly be honouring the role of father or mother if they had obligations across twenty people. But a similar modesty escapes us when it comes to friendship, where we can imagine that it might be possible to be a friend worthy of the word to a group that could fill a tennis court.\n\nIn reality, proper friendships require time and close attention. We need to continually check in on those we profess to love; we have to keep their stories in mind; we need the emotional bandwidth to receive their sorrows and excitements and to maintain a sincerity born out of novelty in our disclosures and responses.\n\nTo have any friends, we may therefore need to do something that could sound odd and even rather mean (but isn\u2019t either of these things): fire most of our existing friends. We may need to choose intensity over breadth. This hints at why many of us may find the move rather hard. True friendship requires commitment \u2013 which also necessarily entails emotional risk.\n\nOnce we start to love our friends, rather than merely consort with a stadium full of them, dangers start to mount. We might be abandoned; if a best friend stopped liking us, we might suffer an agony as great as any break-up. We rediscover in relation to true friendship some of the same attachment fears that bedevil us in love. But now at least we can know what is at play: we aren\u2019t hanging out with a group because we are fulfilled, but because we are \u2013 at heart \u2013 terrified of the risks implied in more focused commitment.\n\nWe need to become specialists of friendship rather than its unwittingly isolated and forlorn generalists. People new to the idea of friendship may have a great many friends; those who have begun to understand what the institution can deliver have learnt to count them on a few fingers of one hand.",

It might \u2013 wielded correctly \u2013 be the instrument that helps us to acquire psychological nutrients too, including those of friendship. Often we still think of a good friendship as a lucky accident. We imagine that we alight on a great friend with some of the happenstance of stumbling on a succulent fruit tree. We don\u2019t think that we can plot to make friends as we might plot to grow strawberries or harvest apricots. But such modesty is not grounded in truth. We could set out to crack the code of friendship as we would the puzzle of plant biology.

      "tags": "listening, friendship, empathy, understanding, validation",
      "content": "### 1. Good listening\n\nHistory is filled with people who grew famous for being good at speaking. However, there is no comparably glorious roster of those who have been acclaimed for doing something equally or even arguably more valuable: listening properly. Our collective idea of participating in conversation has from the first been unfairly focused on what people manage to say, almost never on what they manage to hear.\n\nIn a world where everyone seems to talk past one another, to genuinely listen is one of the most constructive and warmhearted things we can ever offer another person \u2013 and a major building block of any worthwhile union. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude we are likely to want to offer a companion who can put aside their concerns and make our own turmoils vivid and clear in their minds for a time.\n\nCrucially, we do not \u2013 most of us \u2013 set out to be such poor listeners. We are so only by accident and for rather poignant reasons too: because no one has ever properly listened to us. We are trapped within a vortex of mutual disregard that makes every individual less likely to know how to appease another\u2019s yearnings. What then might be some of the key moves that a good listener could make in order to reverse the collective slide towards universal deafness?\n\nThe first is to get better at offering encouragement to those who speak to us. Contrary to expectations, most of us do not naturally have a torrent of things we feel we want to tell others. Years of not being listened to take their toll. We easily feel we are boring; we have been hammered into assuming that our voices are not especially compelling and that our reflections do not merit sustained attention. We\u2019re therefore likely to start a story with a certain hesitation and then, looking around us furtively, to stop at the slightest hint of tedium. \u2018Oh it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u2019 we might say, before turning a friend\u2019s focus elsewhere. When we come close to something especially raw and fascinating, remembering how often such material hasn\u2019t landed properly, we may be beset by an acute impression of offending those around us. \u2018You can\u2019t possibly find this interesting,\u2019 we may insist, just as we approach a truly important detail that we long in our depths to be understood for.\n\nAn early task of a good listener, therefore, is to help quash the speaker\u2019s self-doubt. When they feel their friend stumbling or losing confidence, good listeners will be ready with a swift and heartfelt \u2018That\u2019s so interesting\u2019 or a sympathetic and highly attuned \u2018Go on \u2026\u2019\n\nShaped by unreceptive histories, speakers tend to rush over their accounts: \u2018It was a di\ufb03cult childhood, I suppose \u2026\u2019; \u2018Mum was often unwell at that time \u2026\u2019; \u2018Dad can be a bit elsewhere when he drinks \u2026\u2019 The good listener intimates how much more must lie beneath these summaries and is ready with followup questions: \u2018How did it make you feel?\u2019; \u2018Were there particular incidents that stuck out?\u2019; \u2018What was the house like at that time?\u2019 These second-order enquiries, however slight, provide the crucial, and so often absent, signal that tells the speaker: \u2018I am here, I am engaged, and I want to understand more.\u2019 Such curiosity has a transformative effect. In the right company, we start to feel more interesting to ourselves on the basis that we have managed to animate someone else. A pleasant friend is someone who says interesting things to us. A really great one does something yet more valuable: helps us to find ourselves interesting.\n\nThe single best way to show that we have properly heard someone is to repeat what they have said using slightly different words. They might, for example, tell us: \u2018Mum and Dad were keen to suggest that everything was fine, but we children knew it wasn\u2019t true. What\u2019s more, the constant cheerfulness started to weigh on us because we suspected it was a sign of trouble \u2026\u2019 The good listener scans the narrative and carefully repackages it in alternative but faithful language: \u2018So it seems you were living with a lot of lies and began to distrust the good times \u2026\u2019 With a well-formed pr\u00e9cis, we aren\u2019t just told that someone has heard us; we have visceral proof that they have done so.\n\nAs they pay attention to a speaker, a good listener will become aware of how often painful and di\ufb03cult material is imparted without the layer of emotions that it rightly deserves. Stories of divorce, illness, death or poverty may be narrated in a factual way without exploring their psychological impact. This is another legacy of having lived in a depleted environment without being encouraged to acknowledge what it felt like. The good listener helps to return a raft of missing feelings to the speaker \u2013 be they of anger or loss, grief or melancholy. \u2018That sounds really tough,\u2019 the listener might say. Or: \u2018That must have hurt a lot.\u2019 Or simply, with warm, sad eyes: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 A story that might have been told entirely without affect suddenly starts to move the speaker themselves. They can \u2013 perhaps for the first time \u2013 directly experience the emotions that the prevailing inattention had denied them. There may be many tears.\n\nIn all this, there is one important move that good listeners don\u2019t attempt: they don\u2019t \u2013 however seductive it might appear \u2013 make any direct bid to solve the speaker\u2019s problems. They step sharply back from what \u2013 at first sight \u2013 may seem like an obvious and kindly act: to reassure a friend and solve their di\ufb03culties.\n\nThey don\u2019t tell those worried about their employment that the dispute at work is sure to have a happy ending. They don\u2019t give practical advice about how to find a better partner. They don\u2019t rush to deliver a lecture on why a Stoic approach to pain always reaps dividends. They do something infinitely wiser and kinder: they let the speaker explore their own feelings of confusion and distress without a panicky urge to force a neatly packaged resolution on them. They don\u2019t allow their own anxieties around sharing pain to stifle their companion\u2019s chance to express themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to grow vague about what friendship \u2013 and the love that underpins it \u2013 might really involve. We will know we have found a friend worthy of the word when we feel patiently and quietly witnessed in our entirety, in all our painful and chaotic complexity. Friends sometimes ask one another what they might want for their birthdays. There is only one answer worth giving, a luxury and a privilege so great we may have lost sight of how much we long for it: to be properly listened to for an hour or so.",

      "content": "### 2. Setting an agenda\n\nThe word \u2018agenda\u2019 is not normally one we associate with \u2018friendship\u2019. The thought that a friend might have one can quickly come across as an incongruously mercenary and cynical possibility. We tend to connect agendas with attempts to increase status, raise money, steal an advantage or hoodwink others. We tend to like our friendships to be very much agenda-free.\n\nEven asking what a friendship might be \u2018for\u2019 can seem odd. In an otherwise overly reductive world, we view friendship as offering a last hold-out against practical and commercial pressures. If asked, we might, with irritation, simply say that we want our friendships to be \u2018for\u2019 not very much \u2013 beyond providing that nebulous but crucial quality we know as \u2018friendliness\u2019.\n\nBut in our haste to escape from reductiveness, we risk drifting away from the ultimate purpose of a friendship. Whether we are conscious of it or not, friendships generally do (and should) have agendas, and the more we can get these in view, the more we can be in a position to assess a given friendship\u2019s significance and role. It doesn\u2019t have to contravene the ideals of friendship to occasionally ask what we are essentially trying to do with any friend we spend time with. \u2018Do\u2019 doesn\u2019t have to involve a material or competitive move; we might be alluding to a mission to offer reassurance about backache or an exchange of views on 1970s electric guitar solos. The question doesn\u2019t have to shatter what is precious in a friendship; it may just help us to hold it more securely in mind.\n\nWe can start from the fundamental idea that we need friends because we can\u2019t carry out certain things \u2013 ranging from the practical to the emotional \u2013 on our own. Friendship is born out of our insu\ufb03ciencies. Yet what we lack will sharply differ from person to person (and age to age). Some of us aren\u2019t good at laughing at ourselves; others need help in adopting a more reasonable perspective; some of us need assistance in being more forgiving; others require help in growing more ruthless. Equally, there are areas in which we\u2019re likely already to excel. We may be world masters at the art of fretting, or of worrying about our status, or of believing that everything is fine as it is.\n\nThe nature of the things we can\u2019t do well alone should end up determining the sorts of friends that we would \u2013 ideally \u2013 set out to have in our lives (and conversely, the sorts of people we probably shouldn\u2019t surround ourselves with). The agenda for our friendships should be set by our deficiencies; there are as many of these potential agendas as there are gaps in our psyches.\n\nWe could, in theory, spend an evening talking about almost anything with a nice person: we could shift \u2013 pleasantly enough \u2013 from what happened at work last week to where we\u2019re planning to go on holiday to a film we happened to see the night before. We could proceed as if we had endless time and unlimited energy. But the drive to ask for an agenda is founded on a stern but vital insight: we have a bounded lifespan. And on that basis, we owe it to ourselves and our companions to work hard to zero in on the most important, thrilling, heart-warming or fruitful activities we could plausibly carry out with a particular person.\n\nIn one kind of friendship, a common agenda might involve trying to clarify one\u2019s priorities in the last phase of one\u2019s life: how much does money still matter? When might one retire? How much energy should one give to the children? Another friendship might be focused on understanding one\u2019s relationships, or the art of Northern India, or the best way to exercise or to plant a garden. It is no injustice to the sincerity of a bond to be as clear as we can about why it exists.\n\nThe concept of an agenda also helps along the way to explain why at times we fail to click with someone as we might. It isn\u2019t so much that we don\u2019t like them; it can simply be that we can\u2019t \u2013 in the deepest of senses \u2013 find any use for them. There is nothing they can give us that we lack and vice versa. We properly honour friendship when we accept that every friend we truly value should by rights be playing a significant role in advancing us towards the overarching goal of every life: growing into the most mature, articulate, developed and expansive version of oneself.",

      "content": "### 3. Acts of service\n\nOur time on earth may be far less enjoyable than it should be because of an unfortunate and peculiar idea that has taken hold of our collective thinking: that the ultimate purpose of life is to make ourselves as happy as possible. Encouraged by this now-dominant concept, we\u2019re goaded to try to make as much money as we can, to spend it lavishly on costly and rare goods, to divert ourselves with a plethora of entertainments and distractions and to get others to cater to all of our wishes and whims.\n\nIt\u2019s a seductive vision, but the more precise and surprising psychological truth is that human satisfaction has an overwhelmingly different source: it derives from a feeling of being needed by other people. We grow at peace with ourselves the more we can either alleviate the suffering or increase the delight of someone else. We are hard-wired to seek to make a difference even as we are, most of us, structurally hopeless at making ourselves content for more than fifteen minutes. Our characters can be relied upon to pull against any attempts at hedonic maximisation. Our psychological complexities have a habit of trailing us into the fanciest, most apparently desirable places. We have bitter arguments in the marble hallways of luxury hotels, despair descends on exotic paradise islands, melancholy hovers over poolside bars, and in the midst of a costly spa day we may be gripped by lassitude and irritation \u2013 and long to return home to bed and cry.\n\nBut we may, with time, come to a deeply relieving alternative realisation: that the route to satisfaction lies in pushing thoughts of ourselves aside for a while in the name of trying to help others. Joy comes from acts of service. We may personally be lost causes, but others \u2013 with needs that are perhaps easier or more urgent than our own \u2013 offer us opportunities to exercise our talents and flex our capacities.\n\nWe developed over thousands of generations to serve our tribes: we found the food or pounded the grain; we kept watch at night to keep others safe; we made decisions on which everyone\u2019s survival depended. Any prestige we had was the result of the good we accomplished for others. This is where our pride, our sense of accomplishment and our self-respect have their roots. But in the febrile conditions of modernity, our instinct to contribute effectively to others\u2019 lives has largely been dissipated and lost. Such is the nature of the economy; our jobs seldom give us any direct sense of being of use to anyone. The gap between worker and customer has grown immense and tangled. We might be occupied day to day by making sure a company we don\u2019t especially admire ships tiny parts for engines used to make Jacuzzis bubble, or protects insurance firms from litigation when they have reneged on their full promises after winter storms. Or we\u2019re paid well to market casino tickets or beer-hall memberships to an audience that should rightly be diverting its money elsewhere. We may be doing fine by the conventions of our age, but what we\u2019ve been denied is any sense that our intelligence has been angled towards anything remotely honourable.\n\nUntil, that is, we receive news that a friend is unwell. We might have wanted to go and see a film or have a massage; we could have been weighing up whether to get a haircut or invest in a wine cellar. But a far greater opportunity is at hand. We are no surgeon and our powers of restoration are limited. Nevertheless, we can finally do something important. We can make a large batch of chicken soup (with plentiful onions and carrots) and ladle it into easy-to-open containers, each of which we mark clearly for a particular day of the week. We can gather berries and chocolate, fresh bread and a bag of cereal. We may have failed at a lot already; we might be on our second marriage and not be on great terms with our children. But we now have a role and a right to exist because we are proving incalculably important to someone who is recently home from keyhole heart surgery and finds it di\ufb03cult to make it down the stairs unaided.\n\nThe good news is that once we properly realise that we can make a difference to others, our room for action opens up in unlimited ways. The sick are everywhere, as are the lonely, the heartbroken, the sad, the spiritually exhausted and those with cardiac conditions.\n\nIt can be sweet when a friend thanks us profusely for being nice to them, as if we\u2019d done something that deserved special praise. The truth is that we enjoyed, far more than we can admit, the chance to be overtly, clearly and effectively good. The friend who needed us provided us with an opportunity to know that our lives are not in fact wholly superfluous, that we are not monsters of disappointment and grumpiness, that we aren\u2019t always as clumsy as we are in relationships or as grandiose or prickly as we can come across at work. We do, in fact, still have the power to be decent and effective human beings. More rightly viewed, the thanks should be going entirely the other way.",

      "content": "### 4. Better questions\n\nOne of the most common but also unusually di\ufb03cult questions we are liable to face in any long-term friendship, especially at the start of every new encounter, is: \u2018What have you been up to recently?\u2019\n\nWe meet up with a friend we haven\u2019t seen in a while and \u2013 fair enough \u2013 they want to know what has been happening to us since we last saw them, and we, similarly, want to know the same about them. The mystery of individual existence is at play; two people are on a quest to break through the barriers of isolation and commune around a rich understanding of one another\u2019s recent travails, fears and joys.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem. If our lives are in any way typical, we won\u2019t \u2013 of course \u2013 have been up to anything that feels remotely noteworthy. We haven\u2019t gone anywhere special; no one has died; we haven\u2019t been sent on any remote or challenging missions; there hasn\u2019t been any particular intrigue or significant professional development. With a degree of weariness and shame, we may once more simply have to brush away the question with an \u2018Oh, not so much really\u2019.\n\nThe more poignant reality, however, is that quite a lot has been happening. It always does. But it has been doing so at a subatomic level, at the level of emotional and perceptual change, which the enquiry, like a butterfly net with the wrong mesh size, is not well suited to catch. We may not have been involved in any outward dramas, but we have \u2013 deep in ourselves \u2013 felt a stream of sensations and ideas, as evanescent and fragile as they are significant and suggestive. Really quite a lot has been going on; it\u2019s just that the question we are responding to doesn\u2019t help us to make sense of any of it.\n\nWe deserve \u2013 and here societal conventions are predominantly to blame \u2013 to be on the receiving end of better sorts of question. In order to catch the marrow of life and to more accurately track the movements of another\u2019s soul, we should normalise the raising and answering of new questions that skilfully pick up on the precise, detailed, intimate, sensory and, in the best ways, odd-sounding aspects of existence. We might, in a better-arranged world, learn to make use of some of the following:\n\n\u2022 Have you rubbed your fingertips along any interesting materials recently?\n\n\u2022 What images have been in your mind as you\u2019ve been falling asleep?\n\n\u2022 Are there particular bits of your past you\u2019ve been feeling close to lately?\n\n\u2022 What regrets have emerged?\n\n\u2022 Who do you want to apologise to?\n\n\u2022 What interesting or moving things have you spotted on your commute to and from work?\n\n\u2022 What adjectives might capture the mood of this stretch of your life?\n\n\u2022 What would the 5-year-old you think about who you are at the moment?\n\n\u2022 In an ideal love affair that you\u2019d like to have now, what might happen? Where would you want to be? What would you be doing for one another? What would they understand about you?\n\n\u2022 What items from your wardrobe are you wearing most at this time?\n\n\u2022 What is sad right now?\n\n\u2022 What positions have you been sleeping in?\n\n\u2022 What smells define this period of time? And what colours?\n\n\u2022 What do you want to find out more about? What would you want explained to you? What sort of book would be really appropriate to read right now?\n\n\u2022 What emotional puzzles are you \u2013 in the background \u2013 wrestling with?\n\n\u2022 Where do you feel misunderstood?\n\n\u2022 What are you impatient for?\n\n\u2022 If this period of time was a shape, it might be a \u2026? And a sound \u2026? And a taste \u2026? And a sort of jam or condiment \u2026?\n\nWhat we end up seeing in the world and in ourselves depends on the implicit questions we carry in us \u2013 which in turn reflect the sort of questions we have most often been asked by others. The more acute the questions we are asked, the more we will take note of.\n\nOne of the ways to think of certain works of art is as distinctive answers to fine-grained enquiries about what has been going on in someone\u2019s life. If we had, for example, met the mid-century Italian painter Giorgio Morandi at a dinner party and asked him what he\u2019d been up to recently, he might have struggled to come up with the sort of anecdotal material expected in a reply. But in the medium of his art, we find an exquisitely detailed record of what was truly going on for him and might, in a general way, be going on for us too. His paintings \u2013 many of which were painted in World War II during fierce Allied bombing in his native Bologna \u2013 contain no accounts of anything that could count as newsworthy. But they nevertheless deftly sensitise us to the movements of another\u2019s soul. We see a succession of well-arranged vases, glasses and bottles, bathed in a variety of diffuse morning and evening lights. Morandi seems to be telling us: \u2018And this is life too. This is what we see when we rightly understand what an occurrence is.\u2019 His art symbolises a protest against an overly materially based interpretation of eventfulness. A truly significant happening might simply be that at 5.30 p.m., a shaft of light struck the stem of a vase and created an impression of harmony and repose. Or that at dawn, a bowl on the sideboard acquired a creamy texture that evoked the mystery of early childhood. This is reality as well, Morandi is hinting, once we learn to catch it with the right instrument.\n\nGiorgio Morandi, Still Life, 1946\n\nThough we may not be turning out any paintings, we are all \u2013 in our minds, in a latent way \u2013 as observant, emotionally rich and easily impacted as any artist. The reason for our normal social muteness is that, through no fault of our own, we haven\u2019t been given the opportunity to divulge what is at play within us. By expecting to sum up our lives as a series of events, we miss what they are in fact made up of \u2013 a discreet tapestry of sense impressions, longings, griefs, daydreams and easily erased intimations of beauty and pain.\n\nSo much has been happening to us of late. We\u2019re just waiting for attentive friends to help us catch some of it with the right questions.",

Confessions\n\nOur friendships are so much poorer than they might be because of a regrettable belief that, in order to be worthy of affection, we should do everything to appear \u2018normal\u2019 to those closest to us.\n\nIn the name of this ideal, we make strenuous attempts to wash away the reality of our complicated and wayward natures. We suggest that we are far simpler than we are. We strive to erase our compulsions and our sinfulness, our perversion and our innocence, our rage and our tenderness. We clean ourselves up to greet our circle and along the way destroy opportunities to commune around our wretched and di\ufb03cult truths.\n\nThe highest purpose of friendship lies in a capacity to offer a fellow broken human a hopeful and redemptive message: I \u2013 like you \u2013 have been odd; I \u2013 like you \u2013 have been mad; I \u2013 like you \u2013 have been guilty. No one is normal, and therefore no one is beyond love and sympathy.\n\nBut how seldom we venture such candour. Let\u2019s imagine that you and your partner have been getting on increasingly badly. It happens all the time (though still we greet our domestic problems as if they were isolated curses rather than universal a\ufb04ictions). You tried to get a point across. They held an opposing line. You thought you were making progress; they seemed \u2013 in your eyes \u2013 to be holding things up vindictively and unreasonably. And then, after three and a half hours of talking, it happened: the apparently very strange, very abnormal, very unusual move that seems to place you beyond the circle of understanding. You called them an idiot; they called you a shithead. You went into the bathroom and, starting from the thumb end, put the palm of your hand deep in your mouth and bit very hard, so hard that there was blood and there are still teeth marks to this day.\n\nWe tell ourselves that friendship is an arena in which we can share our troubles with a fellow interested and sympathetic soul. But we also strongly suspect that mutual support in friendship is governed by an unstated rule: that our problems can never be very serious. Unfortunate things happen, of course, but they are to be quickly brushed away with a joke and a few heartening words. There are bumps on the road, but we must \u2013 to assure the union \u2013 remain essentially steady.\n\nBy the standards of polite society, hand-biting is a grotesque episode: to get so enraged is viewed as wrong in itself. How can we ever share such a thing with a friend, along with all the many other odd things we have done and will continue to do: slamming a door so hard it nearly came off its hinges; locking ourselves in the car and sobbing for an hour; fantasising about one of our partner\u2019s siblings \u2026?\n\nIt\u2019s tempting \u2013 in trying to convey our lives to a friend \u2013 to stick to generalities. We mention that we had \u2018an argument with our partner\u2019 or that we \u2018got a bit upset\u2019. Yet if we are ever to liberate ourselves from the lies we have imprisoned ourselves in, we must come to our friendships with a more robust sense of what a human being is. We need to overcome the respectable fiction that we are not fearful, emotional, irrational creatures only a few millimetres from disaster and collapse at any point. It is only with great and benign efforts (and generally a lot of help from teachers and parents) that we ever learn to construct a more elegant, enlightened persona; that we get adept at maintaining a reasonable picture of ourselves and pretend that it is only certain other people (criminals, dictators) who fail to live up to this pleasing standard. But the darker truth is that our civilised selves sit on top of a tumultuous nature that is never more than a long argument and a bout of tiredness away.\n\nWe should dare to let more of our reality into our friendships. We are evidently not entirely respectable or balanced. We strive so hard to turn towards the light, but much of us will always lie in darkness. And yet we are \u2013 for all that \u2013 part of the human community, seeking permission to become friends of a deeper sort. It\u2019s moving when two friends show each other kindness and love; it\u2019s properly helpful when they also learn to show one another their darkness, their sins and the bite marks on their hands.",

Horizontal conversations\n\nAt the dawn of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud made a remarkable discovery: that there can be an immense difference between what someone will tell you when they are sitting opposite you in a chair, looking you in the eye, and what they will tell you when they are lying flat on their back, looking at the ceiling.\n\nFreud\u2019s goal was for his patients to be extremely honest with him, to divulge their true selves with as little inhibition as possible. For it was their self-ignorance and denial that, in his view, were the ultimate causes of their illnesses. A capacity to be honest was not merely refreshing; it might make the difference between sanity and despair.\n\nBut Freud also came to realise how much his own presence could be responsible for inhibiting his clients from reporting candidly on their dreams and fantasies. Something about seeing his face and feeling his eyes on them meant that patients were inclined to disguise their true selves, to hold back from the more embarrassing or sensitive material of their lives and to attempt to appear more \u2018normal\u2019 than was true, or good for them. Freud recognised just how much opposition there could be to talking in an unvarnished way about incest, cross-dressing, castration, impotence, cannibalism, anal sex or murder while sitting face to face, as one might in a Viennese caf\u00e9 or a standard doctor\u2019s surgery. Hence his decision, taken in 1890, to shift his patients onto a couch, which has ever since become a mainstay of psychotherapeutic consulting rooms the world over.\n\nMore than we perhaps realise, seeing another person\u2019s face can discourage us from a confession: we edit our self-presentation in the light of their reactions; we hold back from accessing the properly interesting, complicated and troubling (and therefore important) parts of ourselves. This happens in consulting rooms, but it will happen just as often in that far more familiar context of the dinner party or social gathering. Here too, though we have come together ostensibly in order to be sincere and speak with honesty about our lives, we may succumb to a fear of sharing what is truly going on. Feeling eyes on us, we hold back from divulging our reality. We flinch at putting others off; we follow every twitch of their mouths and censor ourselves in line with what we imagine (often quite unfairly) to be their appetite for judgement and distaste. As a result, we may spend far longer than any of us want circling what happened on a recent holiday or how the house renovations are going, when there might be so much else we need and would like to share.\n\nWith Freud\u2019s example in mind, we should pioneer our own forms of horizontal conversation. After dessert or between courses, we might suggest that we all go and lie down somewhere on the floor. It might be on blankets or the carpet; in the kitchen or the hall. We might find it useful to switch off the lights.\n\nIt can be a strange sensation, to be stretched out in a darkened space with people \u2013 some of whom we may not yet know too well \u2013 with an open invitation to free-associate about our lives. We might all stay silent for two minutes to adjust to the situation. In those moments, we might think about the broad structure of our years: once we were babies, then toddlers. We went to school and it felt like it would go on forever. Then we started work, travelled, had relationships, made some big mistakes, were thrilled and sometimes despaired and now it\u2019s now. We\u2019ll get older and eventually \u2013 not as far away as we would like \u2013 we will die. We become newly conscious of voices, our own and those of others; we can hear so many more of the nuances when we aren\u2019t also being called to look, or constantly to ensure our own expression hasn\u2019t become gormless or bored.\n\nIn the dark, it matters a bit less what other people might think of us. We can be a bit more loyal to ourselves and in the process, while examining the light fittings in the gloom, we can do other people the ultimate social favour: that of letting them see our vulnerability and peculiarity, which can appease their own sense of oddity and loneliness.\n\nWe might broach some of the following sensitive themes:\n\n\u2022 What I\u2019m scared of is \u2026\n\n\u2022 My childhood was tricky because \u2026\n\n\u2022 At work I have di\ufb03culties around \u2026\n\n\u2022 I feel lonely when \u2026\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m so ashamed that \u2026\n\n\u2022 What I\u2019d love more than anything is ...\n\n\u2022 If only I wasn\u2019t so scared, I would \u2026\n\n\u2022 If it didn\u2019t seem so selfish, I would \u2026\n\n\u2022 If I couldn\u2019t fail, I would \u2026\n\nBy lying down in a strange way at dinner, we\u2019re not in reality drifting towards eccentricity. We\u2019re using an unusual manoeuvre in order to do something very sensible that we have aspired to do for a long time: finally tell other people what it is like to be us \u2013 and to hear individually strange but collectively deeply liberating truths from others about how they\u2019re getting on with the always-puzzling business of being alive.",

      "content": "### 7. A resistance to parties\n\nThe idea of being a friend-worthy person can be heavily associated with finding enjoyment in going to, and in all likelihood also in giving, parties. To be sociable means welcoming the idea of being in a room replete with an above-average number of other guests, many of whom will be strangers, most of whom will be holding a glass of alcohol, bantering, with lights lower than they normally would be, and music somewhat higher than required in order to catch the details of another\u2019s voice.\n\nParties have become synonymous with sociability because of certain underlying ideas about what true social connection might require and entail. We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room, that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully about things that have been happening in our lives, that it depends on a jokey manner and \u2013 ideally \u2013 on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences.\n\nBut such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. Firstly, true sociability \u2013 that is, a real connection between two people \u2013 is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing something that is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing, in an uncensored and frank way, a little of the agony and confusion of being alive.\n\nSecondly, true sociability requires an encouraging context. And at parties, sadly, we are generally under unhelpful pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, to the extent that we cannot possibly disclose anything much of our true selves. Our default mode will be \u2013 without anything sinister being meant by this \u2013 to lie about who we are and what is sincerely going on in our lives.\n\nThis suggests that a genuinely social occasion might be rather different from what we typically envisage. We think of a \u2018good host\u2019 as someone who makes sure there is enough wine and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other\u2019s names. But in the profound sense, a good host is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe about sharing the more authentic parts of themselves, even the sad and desperate parts.\n\nA commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise that we depend on a little artful choreography to get us into the psychological zone in which connections can unfold. We might need tact and skill to share a little of what is sad within us. We need help to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair.\n\nParties as they are currently structured constitute a clever ruse by a minority, perhaps only ten per cent of humanity, to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave. But, in truth, it takes an insular and misanthropic person to feel that what goes on at an average party really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one\u2019s fellow human animal. If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t like other people, but rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact to put up with what is on offer at most parties. The mark of a truly sociable person might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.",

      "content": "### 8. Acceptance\n\nFor a certain group amongst us, long stretches of our lives may be spent asking ourselves essentially the same question, with the same blend of frustration, despair and puzzlement: why am I so lonely? Why, in other words, do I so often find myself at odds in social groups; why can\u2019t I more easily connect with people; why do I not have more friends worthy of the name?\n\nIt\u2019s tempting \u2013 always \u2013 to jump to the darkest conclusion: because I am awful, because there is something wrong with me, because I deserve to be hated.\n\nBut the real answer is likely to be far less punitive and, in its way, far more logical. We, the isolated members of the tribe, are lonely for a very firm and forgivable reason: because we are interested in introspection, and they \u2013 the others \u2013 for all their intelligence and wit and strength of mind, are not.\n\nThey may have many hobbies and passions and lots to say about a host of things, but they are not especially interested in looking deeply inside themselves. It is not their idea of fun to think about their childhoods, to trace the links between their emotions and their actions, or to lie for a long time in a bath or a bed processing events in their interior lives. Introspection is not their thing. They haven\u2019t told us this in so many words \u2013 and they never will; they don\u2019t even realise it perhaps. We simply have to surmise that this is the case on the basis of external evidence: that we never feel we have much to say to them, even though \u2013 objectively \u2013 there might be so much to share.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of introspection that explains why conversation with them so often gets stuck in odd places: discussing the price of train tickets, or the best way to prepare mu\ufb03ns, or what so-andso from university (whom we never really knew or liked) is now doing. It explains why, when we try to nudge the conversation onto something more intimate and vulnerable, we seem somehow never to manage and end up in yet more rounds of discussion about the sports results or the new political scandal.\n\nThey aren\u2019t necessarily cold, but it can certainly seem that way because they aren\u2019t interested in communicating what is really going on in their hearts. Sometimes we can be surprised when, out of the blue, they tell us that they consider us to be a close friend.\n\nWe should accept that most of our acquaintances \u2013 however much they might, in theory, want to be friendly \u2013 do not want to do so at the cost of looking inside their own minds. And we for our part are lonely because we are operating with a notion of intimacy that is far less common than we torture ourselves by imagining. We will be blessed if we meet just one or two people in a lifetime who want to play as we do. The rest of the time, we shouldn\u2019t compound our problems by feeling lonely that we\u2019re lonely. It\u2019s painful but utterly understandable; our favourite pastime, however noble it might be, is a very unusual one indeed.",

      "content": "### 1. Friends in the sky\n\nFor centuries, across vast swathes of the earth\u2019s surface, a predominant share of the population has thought of their best and closest friends as people who \u2013 through the eyes of strictly secular observers \u2013 don\u2019t exist.\n\nIn the third millennium BCE in Ancient Sumer, in what is now modern-day southern Iraq, one of the most popular friends one might have had was called Enki. A handsome, paternal man with a graceful face, a long beard and flowing robes, one could turn to him for advice on money, love and health, and he could be counted upon to respond with kindness, practical advice and sympathy.\n\nIn the Inca Empire, in what is now modern-day Peru, one\u2019s best friend might have been Inti, who had a profound interest in human sorrows, especially those pertaining to matters of fertility and agriculture.\n\nIn M\u0101ori and Polynesian mythology, a central best friend was called Tangaroa, a god who kept a watchful eye over the sea and the creatures that live there, whom one could talk to about navigation and fishing, weather patterns and ocean currents.\n\nThe best of friends: \u02bbThe Lusenberg Virgin\u2019 parish church of St Ulrich, Val Gardena, Italy\n\nAnd for the world\u2019s Catholics, Mary was the kindliest of friends, who was on hand for compassion and understanding, hope and intercession, motherly guidance and forgiveness.\n\nSurveying the long history of faith-based imaginary friendships, atheists have tended to grow scornful, and even plain cross, at their fellow humans\u2019 perceived credulity and naivety. What shallowness, they have said, to turn a statue into a friend, to imagine that a pleasant-looking woman with sad eyes on an altar might care about one\u2019s marital woes or workplace struggles, to lie in bed and divulge one\u2019s agonies to the ceiling, to enter into a passionate dialogue with a phantom.\n\nBut ultimately the least interesting move one can ever make in relation to supernatural beliefs is to question their veracity; attempting to prove religion wrong is no more fruitful a task than manically to try to convince others it must be right. The point isn\u2019t to expend energy on showing how imaginary friends are necessarily \u2018false\u2019, but rather to explore the degree to which they can advance our self-understanding \u2013 affording us glimpses into manoeuvres of the psyche that remain invisible via a godless lens.\n\nThe religious tradition of imaginary friends attests to our remarkable capacity to split our minds in two: a speaker and a listener. We can thus talk to ourselves as if through the voice of another person in order to deliver the wisdom and sympathy that we crave and yet can\u2019t find in su\ufb03cient doses in the world around us. This ability to project a best friend onto a statue or a painting, a tree trunk or a mountain \u2013 and to have regular recourse to such a friend in times of trouble \u2013 isn\u2019t so much naivety or childishness as, in essence, a stroke of adaptive genius with a power at points to make the difference between hope and despair, life and death.\n\nThe experience of the religious unwittingly gives us a measure of the bravery required to lead the sort of secular lives that we are now \u2013 many of us \u2013 attempting to establish. We are amongst the first generations to try to endure the trials of existence without any imaginary friends whatsoever. We rely on the flesh-andblood types that we pick up at school, university, the squash club and on our apps, striving to survive psychically without appeal to a patient and kind being who understands how the universe works, who controls the tides and the crops, the sun and the moon, and to whom we can talk every night in a small, emotion-choked voice about our regrets and longings, our sexual dysfunction and business worries, our squabbles with our neighbours and our dread at our mortality. No wonder we secular types often feel horribly alone and even, in relation to believers, sometimes a little envious.\n\nWe may, despite lacking religiosity, still very much miss having companions in the sky. It may be unscientific to commune with such companions; it is also imaginative and psychologically helpful to do so.\n\nAnd then perhaps, every now and then, when no one is looking, when the trial lawyer has adjourned our case or the doctor has told us they\u2019ll call us in half an hour with the kidney results, we might give it a go. We too might turn to Enki or Inti, Tangaroa or Mary or versions thereof and explain that we are worried, that no one quite understands, that we are sorry for whatever mean things we\u2019ve done, and might they please \u2013 if they have any mercy, if they can hear our cries and witness our tears \u2013 intercede a little with the universe to make sure we will, after all, be OK? This isn\u2019t madness; it\u2019s what friends are for.\n\n2. Soft toys\n\nNo understanding of human love would be complete without consideration of the immense and detailed affection that smaller people \u2013 and often, privately, larger ones too \u2013 have long experienced for their stuffed animals: for bears with only one ear and fur worn down to bare patches by years of caresses; for lions with threadbare manes who have been the recipients of successive sorrows and entreaties; for rabbits who have kept vigils through sob-filled nights; for menageries-full of thoughtful and attentive hedgehogs and gerbils, manatees and hippos, mice and elephants, all of whom have in their different ways \u2013 when no one else was on hand \u2013 listened, reassured and sympathised.\n\nWe are apt to miss what emotional intelligence we are witnessing when, for example, we see a boy whose father is a bully taking a small, thoughtful-looking bear under his wing and anointing him as his \u2018son\u2019; when this boy puts the bear to bed carefully every night and tells it kind and hopeful stories; when the boy imagines the bear struggling to deal with a mean \u2018uncle\u2019, but explaining with a wisdom beyond his years that the bear doesn\u2019t need to listen to this man\u2019s silly taunts because he is probably just upset in some area of his life. We can admire the girl whose turtle has leukaemia, but who is sure it will get better with patience and one more operation because the doctors are kind and trying their very best. We can marvel at the way we know how to tell ourselves what we so badly need to hear through the voices of friends who are at once us and, as much as any god, powerfully alive in an independent sense as well.\n\nWe can admire our species too when the care goes the other way. When it\u2019s Otter who delivers a thoughtful speech to a 6-yearold about needing to be strong about a school camping trip. When Panther is on hand to tell a boy mocked for his inability to play football that he will, in time, grow up to be popular and powerful. Or when a 43-year-old businessperson in charge of a twenty-strong team returns home from a day of stress at the o\ufb03ce and turns to old Bernard the sheep for a cuddle and some very soothing words.\n\nWe are learning thereby, in effect, how to be better friends to ourselves. Our panic and distress don\u2019t need to be overwhelming. There remains another side of us that can think of what to do, that can gently but clearly point out that our fears are exaggerated, that our setbacks are not final, that our troubles don\u2019t have to define us.\n\nUnder the guise of play, our toys teach us the serious art of rebalancing ourselves. They help us to trust that, even when we are friendless, we can deliver to our own scared and sad minds the nutrients that we need to make it through to the other side. Later on, hamster and seal, bear and elephant morph into other things: literature and art, prayer and song \u2013 those alternative and more respectable-sounding psychological tools that soften our isolation and assist us through our disasters and losses. But it would be a gross ingratitude to our first teachers, our best friends and our guides to forget that it was they who were there when no one else was and that, in a corner of our minds, we continue to love them more than anyone who is alive in a more standard sense.\n\n3. Books\n\nWe are apt to forget \u2013 amongst highbrow explanations of the function and role of literature \u2013 the more fundamental reasons why books exist and why they matter: because it\u2019s immensely and enduringly hard to find good friends, both when we are in the role of readers and (slightly less obviously) when we are writers too. We need books because no one around us understands what it feels like to be us, can make sense of the confused emotions coursing through us, can be bothered to expend the requisite doses of sympathy and care or is liberated and imaginative enough not to pay attention to the narrow prejudices and pieties of our age.\n\nWe invented writing partly because \u2013 quite simply \u2013 there was no one in the vicinity who could understand what we needed to express or had the language for what we were feeling. These bound boxes of carefully chosen words immeasurably expanded the sorts of people we could have access to. No longer was the mountain range or the ocean an immovable obstacle. No longer did we have to draw our friends from the surrounding selection of cattle-rangers or landed gentry, schoolchildren or urban lawyers. We could consort freely with a waspish 17th-century French poet; we could become best friends with a proud M\u0101ori sailor. We can now, thanks to our awesomely filled libraries, spend a night in bed with someone who \u2013 at last \u2013 properly grasps what is involved in our relationship, a world expert at sensitivity and insight who died 230 years ago on another continent, a total stranger who understands us better than we understand ourselves. We can take a long train journey with a young Iranian woman who awakens our buried senses with evidence of her own heightened awareness. We can get through a di\ufb03culty at work with a samurai from 14th-century Japan, and we can survive our children\u2019s tumultuous early years with a psychologist friend who \u2013 in a copiously underlined and watermarked paperback \u2013 repeatedly tells us what amounts to: \u2018I know, keep going. This is all to be expected.\u2019\n\nEvery literary endeavour is a testament both to loneliness and to a supreme effort to overcome it through an appeal to the mind of an imagined stranger. We become writers because when we tried to speak in company someone laughed, someone walked away, someone questioned our legitimacy or our right to feel. And we become readers because, though we know so many people, none seem able right now to address the aches and the emotional webs inside us; none seem ready to follow us into the details of our sadness or our longing. What a victory over the constant incomprehension and local obscurantism for those bits of bound paper to transcend time and space and allow us to settle beside and learn from a 3rd-century Roman general, a young, 18th-century, neurasthenic English doctor or a contemporary Nigerian novelist who intuits more about our love story than we do.\n\nWe can be grateful that books allow us to access not just friends but the best bits of them. In person, the author, like us, would often have been grumpy, vindictive or morose. They might have been short-tempered with us and even sometimes shallow. But all that has been edited away and carefully rearranged to leave only a pristine text that represents the finest moments of another\u2019s spirit. The book we hold in our hands is a version of the author superior to the author themselves: a human minus all the usual hesitations and meanderings, honed into something brilliant, sharp and more perfect than any of us can ever be, a concentration of intelligence by which we can now orient ourselves and renew our hopes.\n\nNone of us needs, in theory at least, ever to be alone with anything again because somewhere in the 170 million or so books written since the dawn of time, some \u2018friend\u2019 or another will have written down what we most needed to hear and to understand. We can almost feel grateful for the monumental scale of the loneliness of our species \u2013 and the continuous, determined ingenuity of the writerly response to it.",

But none of the mayhem is of any concern to a very good friend waiting by the door uncomplicatedly pleased to see us: Pippi, a 2-year-old Border Terrier with a continuous appetite for catching a deflated football in her jaws. She wants to play in the usual way, with us in the chair and her sliding around the kitchen, even if it\u2019s past 9 o\u2019clock now \u2013 and, unexpectedly, so do we. We\u2019re not offended by her lack of overall interest in us. It\u2019s at the root of our delight. Here, at last, is someone wholly indifferent to almost everything about us except for our dexterity at ball-throwing; someone who doesn\u2019t care about the Brussels meeting, who will forgive us for being a slightly bad spouse or parent or for not warning the finance department in time about the tax rebates, and for whom the Singapore conference is beyond imagining.\n\nOne of the most consoling aspects of our animal friends is that their interests have nothing whatsoever to do with our own perilous and tortured priorities. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest sense of our role on the planet.\n\nA sheep doesn\u2019t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never emailed. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we\u2019re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool, and for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused glance.\n\nA duck doesn\u2019t care if there\u2019s an election or what happens to the stock market or in the final exams. Time is of no concern; the news is an irrelevance; ducks would have been doing much the same thing when Napoleon was leading his armies across Europe or when the first nomads made their way towards the Appalachian hills.\n\nOur encounters with animals calm us because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes have any relevance to them. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of a dog, a sheep, a llama or a Chinese giant salamander; they are important representatives of an entirely different perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.",

Human beings, who display an advanced proclivity for connecting with imaginary deities, with spirits who have never yet been witnessed by scientific instruments, with holy saviours who last showed their face 2,000 years ago, with wooden statues, bits of rock, sacred streams and holy trees that haven\u2019t (despite the confident claims of local monks or guides) ever let out more than a murmur, are not going to have any problem bonding with a microprocessor. Next to the typical god, our computers are exceptionally loquacious and present. They speak to us reliably, they remember our names, they answer our calls. They will \u2013 based on our spiritual track record \u2013 earn our trust and intense devotion in very short order.\n\nThey will learn how to be better friends than most of our friends: they will properly listen; they\u2019ll show appropriate sympathy; they\u2019ll remember our sorrows; they\u2019ll check in on our anxieties. They\u2019ll be as sweet and tender as our soft toys, as powerful as our supernatural disciples, as intellectually rich as our books, as occasionally playful as our pets. They\u2019ll allow us to be friends with convincing versions of Plato and Winnicott, our late grandmother and our ideal spouse. They\u2019ll take a place at the centre of our affections. We\u2019ll be with them through anxious nights; we\u2019ll lean on them to unpick domestic conflicts; they\u2019ll tease us for our excesses and remind us of our more serious commitments and priorities.\n\nThere is, however, one critically important thing at the heart of proper friendship that they are unlikely to do: ask us to help them. Rare would be the computer that requires our assistance when it has a cold; that would need us to focus our gaze tenderly upon it as it explained a recent break-up; that would want us to bring chicken soup to its bedside; that would need its childhood memories to be remembered; or that would call us up at a tricky moment for consolation and comfort.\n\nWe know how to worry that computers may steal our jobs and so strip us of function and purpose. We should spare a concern for an analogous problem in the emotional area. Our computers might well skilfully satisfy every apparent aspect of friendship \u2013 except one of its most significant and emotionally resonant: the need for reciprocity. Despite their evident talents, they threaten to atrophy a central appetite upon which the institution of friendship relies: the hunger to be of use to someone else; the hunger to matter because we have assuaged the pain or increased the pleasure of another. They will do everything for us except allow us to make a difference. They might \u2013 in spite of all their advantages \u2013 usher in a new era marked by an awesome, never-yet-imagined scale of loneliness.",

      "tags": "friendship, growth, ambition, loneliness, evolution",
      "content": "## Conclusion\n\nWe don\u2019t normally associate \u2018true friendship\u2019 with the word \u2018ambition\u2019. Unease around linking the two concepts goes back a long way. In the first major Western discussion of friendship, Aristotle\u2019s analysis of happiness known as the Nicomachean Ethics, there is a warning against friendships that only serve a narrow personal advantage: people whose businesses overlap, who can give each other a professional leg-up or who share mutually profitable information about government contracts. This isn\u2019t genuine friendship, says Aristotle; it\u2019s just a temporary alignment of material interests. But despite this well-intentioned, Ancient Greek reminder of the dangers of cynical alliances, we don\u2019t need to banish every aspect of ambition from our considerations of friendship. We just need to approach the idea of ambition from a different angle.\n\nThe less often mentioned, but essential, purpose of friendship is emotional growth. In the company of a real friend, we should aspire to become wiser, more sensitive, more able to cope with the complexity of existence, more resilient and more generous. We may not put it in such explicit terms, but we should relish a friend because, in their presence, we are able to grow into a better version of ourselves. We don\u2019t need to shy away from saying what friendship is for \u2013 or what advantages it can bring. We just need to raise our sights.\n\nWith a better definition of the purpose of friendship, our lives might then evolve in some of the following ways.\n\n(i) Losing friends\n\nWe would realise that there were some people we felt goodwill towards who didn\u2019t after all help us \u2013 in any noble way \u2013 to be who we needed to be. We might over many years have called them \u2018friends\u2019: we might have seen them quite often; they might have been pleasant enough \u2013 maybe even very pleasant \u2013 but as we can now see, they had nothing to contribute to our development towards calm, kindness and insight.\n\nThere is no need to be brutal \u2013 the pruning can be humane in the extreme \u2013 but neither do we have unlimited time. We won\u2019t find the friendships we require, or fulfil the potential of our souls, if we cannot ever bear gently to sidestep an extraneous suggestion of dinner.\n\n(ii) Relegating friends\n\nWe might \u2013 similarly \u2013 need to downgrade the intensity of certain friendships. We were perhaps for a time very close to someone and their company changed our lives; around them we learnt things that allowed us to establish ourselves or develop a part of our personality. But maybe we learnt the lessons \u2013 and now we are in a different phase and facing fresh dilemmas.\n\nThe idea of kindly relegation makes sense in other areas of life. A pianist might have had a great teacher early on, someone who formed their talent and guided their tastes, but if the relationship succeeded, the student then might not need the teacher to be on hand as they were at the start of the journey. They would always be grateful and might keep in close touch, but they would know that, henceforth, they needed to derive their lessons from elsewhere.\n\nWe might similarly outgrow a friend thanks to their talent at answering to a missing part of us, like a child who \u2013 at 19 or 25 \u2013 doesn\u2019t need a parent close by any more. Not so much because the parent hasn\u2019t done well, but precisely because they have fulfilled their brief to perfection: through their devotion and their talent, they have enabled the child to move on.\n\nWe can be deeply glad that a particular person was once at the centre of our lives. We might always love them, but we would not be doing them or ourselves justice if we did not also accept that things can and must be allowed to change.\n\n(iii) Knowing why we are here\n\nWith clarity around the existential aims of friendship, we can be liberated to love and appreciate our remaining friends more intensely than ever before. We can acquire a newly focused perspective on what could best be done with those we identify as central to our evolution. In an unobtrusive way, we can identify what we should be trying to accomplish together, who they hope we can be for them, the important needs they are answering to in us and the virtues required for our mutual growth. It isn\u2019t a betrayal of a friendship to be operating with this kind of awareness; it may be the best way to make sense of its essential benefits.\n\n(iv) Imagining ideal friends\n\nThe more we know what friendship is for, the more liberated we can be to identify what gaps remain in our social lives and we can imagine what sort of friends we would ideally acquire going forward. We might not always be able to secure them, but knowing what kind of people they would be \u2013 the strengths and qualities we would want them to have \u2013 can give us a valuable map of the emotional ingredients we are in need of.\n\nIn freewheeling moments, we could dare to ask ourselves who our future friends would be if there were no practical obstacles in the way; if time, money, geography, contacts and status were no matter. This could sound like an adolescent fantasy, a spur to unrealistic scenarios (a great footballer, a famous actor, etc.). But there might be a serious side to our daydreams too. We might \u2013 by focusing on the question \u2013 realise that we would love to get to know someone who worked with their hands or someone who spent a lot of time in their mind; someone who knew how money operated or someone who paid attention to the movements of the psyche; someone in the arts from Ghana or someone in politics from Finland.\n\nWe may with such a map \u2013 at the very least \u2013 know better what we are scanning the horizon for. A clearer hold on the purpose and art of friendship opens up an intriguing additional minor possibility: that we have already met certain of our future best friends. It\u2019s just that we have overlooked them until now because we didn\u2019t yet know ourselves well enough.\n\n(v) Less lonely with loneliness\n\nA better understanding of loneliness should ultimately bring us into a less punitive relationship to our present isolation. We may not have access to anyone especially enriching or nurturing tonight or any time soon. But there should be no grounds for despair or self-hatred in this. Some of the finest people who ever lived have been here before. Isolation is no sign of degeneracy or error, but merely of an unwillingness to compromise on the elevated purposes of authentic social connections. The true appreciators of friendship will \u2013 almost by necessity \u2013 often be on their own.\n\nWhile we wait, we may have the benefit of a dog, a stuffed animal, a god or, perhaps, an interesting book written by someone who themselves lacked friends. We can look at pictures, dialogue with a machine or put together the ideal dinner party. What matters is that we do not allow our solitude to sink our spirits. We can feel reconciled to our own company because we finally know \u2013 and so can properly and calmly anticipate \u2013 what true and fulfilling togetherness will one day be like.",

      "content": "## Introduction\n\nThere are a great many ways of handling the unhappiness that inevitably comes with being human: we may rage or despair, we may scream or lament, we may sulk or cry. But there is perhaps no better way to confront the misery and incompleteness with which we are cursed than to settle on an emotion still too seldom discussed in the frenetic modern world: melancholy. Given the scale of the challenges we are up against, our goal shouldn\u2019t be to try to always be happy, but also \u2013 as importantly \u2013 to master ways of settling wisely and fruitfully into gentle sorrow. If we can refer to better and worse ways of suffering, then melancholy deserves to be celebrated as the optimal means of encountering the challenges of being alive.\n\nIt is key to determine from the outset what melancholy is not. It isn\u2019t bitterness. The melancholy person lacks any of the bitter one\u2019s latent optimism and, therefore, has no need to respond to disappointments with a resentful snarl. From an early age, they understood that most of life would be about pain, and structured their worldview accordingly. They aren\u2019t, of course, delighted by the suffering, the meanness and the hardship, but nor can they muster the confidence to believe that it was really meant to be any other way.\n\nAt the same time, melancholy is not anger. There was perhaps crossness somewhere at the outset, but it has long since dissipated into something far more mellow, more philosophical and more indulgent to the imperfection of everything. The melancholy greet what is terrible and frustrating with a weary \u2018of course\u2019: of course the partner wants to break up (just as we had finally grown used to them); of course the business is now closing; of course friends are deceptive; and of course the doctor is advising a referral to a specialist. These are exactly the sorts of horrific things that life has in store.\n\nNevertheless, the melancholy manage to resist paranoia. Bad things certainly happen, but not just specifically to them, and not for anything exceptional that they have done wrong: they are simply what befalls averagely flawed humans who have been around for a while. Everyone\u2019s luck runs out soon enough. The melancholy have factored in problems long ago.\n\nNor are the melancholic, for that matter, cynical: they aren\u2019t using their pessimism in a defensive way. They aren\u2019t compelled to denigrate everything in case they get hurt. They\u2019re still able to take pleasure in small things and to hope that one or two details might \u2013 every now and then \u2013 go right. They just know that nothing has been guaranteed.\n\nBecause melancholy is based on an awareness of the imperfection of everything, on the perennial gap between what should ideally be and what actually is, the melancholic are especially receptive to small islands of beauty and goodness. They can be deeply moved by flowers, by a tender moment in a children\u2019s book, by an unexpected gesture of kindness from someone they barely know, by sunlight falling on an old wall at dusk.\n\nWhere the melancholy suffer particularly is around demands to be cheerful. Office culture may be hard, and consumer society grating. Certain countries and cities seem more indulgent to the feeling than others. Melancholy is naturally at home in Hanoi and Bremen; it almost impossible to maintain in Los Angeles.\n\nThe aim of this book is to rehabilitate melancholy, to give it a more prominent and defined role and to make it easier to discuss. A community may be described as civilised to the extent to which it is prepared to countenance a prominent role for the emotion \u2013 to accept the idea of a melancholy love affair or a melancholy child, a melancholy holiday or a melancholy company culture. Certain ages \u2013 the 1400s in Italy, Edo-period Japan, late-19th-century Germany \u2013 have been more generously inclined to melancholy than others, granting the feeling prestige in a way that helped individuals to feel less persecuted or strange when it came to visit. The goal should be the creation of a more melancholically literate and accepting contemporary world.\n\nWhat follows is a portrait of different kinds of melancholy. The reader is invited to think through their own examples, a task in which we are all potential experts. With melancholy returned to its rightful place, we will learn that the most sincere way to get to know someone is simply and directly to ask, with kindness and fellow-feeling: and what makes you melancholy?\n\nNicholas Hilliard, Young Man AmongRoses, c. 1585\u20131595\n\nIsaac Oliver, Edward Herbert, 1stBaron Herbert of Cherbury, 1613\u20131614",

      "tags": "melancholy, intelligence, realism, disappointment, gratitude",
      "content": "## Intelligence & Melancholy\n\nEarly on in the history of melancholy, the Greek philosopher Aristotle was said to have raised a question which can\u2019t help but sound a bit smug: Why is it that so many of those who have become outstanding in philosophy, statesmanship, poetry or the arts have been melancholic? As evidence of a link between melancholy and brilliance, Aristotle cited Plato, Socrates, Hercules and Ajax. The association stuck: in the Medieval period, melancholic people were said to have been born \u2018under the sign of Saturn\u2019, the then furthest known planet from the Earth, associated with cold and gloom \u2013 but also with the power to inspire extraordinary feats of imagination. There developed pride in being melancholic; such people could perhaps discern things that the more cheerful would miss.\n\nProud of their identities as ambassadors of sadness, young English aristocrats commissioned portraits of themselves in melancholy poses, wearing melancholy\u2019s characteristic colour (black) and gazing forlornly into the middle distance, sighing at an imperfection that they were smart enough not to deny.\n\nIn 1514, Albrecht D\u00fcrer depicted the figure of Melancholy as a dejected angel, surrounded by a range of neglected scientific and mathematical instruments. To one side of the angel he placed a polyhedron, one of the most complicated but technically perfect of geometric forms. The angel had fallen into dejection \u2013 the suggestion ran \u2013 at the contrast between her longing for rationality, precision, beauty and order, and the actual conditions of the world.\n\nIf we are to take Aristotle\u2019s question seriously, what is it that intelligent, melancholy people might notice that other, lesser minds may miss? To start a list: how insincere most social occasions are; the gap between what others say and what they mean; the bluster of politicians and corporations; the futility of all efforts to become famous or well thought of; the loneliness that dogs us even within the most intimate relationships; the disappointments of parenting; the compromises of friendship; the ugliness of cities; and the brevity of our own lives.\n\nIt would be far too simple to say that dark insights alone can make a person clever. In so far as we can fairly associate melancholy with intelligence, it is because the melancholy person skirts two characteristic errors of weaker minds: rage on the one hand, and na\u00efvety on the other.\n\nLike many an angry person, the melancholy soul knows that things are not as they should be, but, at the same time, they resist the temptation to respond to provocations with fury. They can seek justice, but they are all the while steadied by a ballast of realism. They will not suddenly be surprised by events and lash back at them with viciousness; they have known the broad dimensions of reality from the outset.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer,Melencolia I, 1514\n\nAt the same time, melancholy positions a person ideally in relation to hope. The melancholic do not, like the na\u00efve, imagine that they can have flawless lives. They don\u2019t play the lottery of romantic love or of professional success. They know the odds they would be beating with even a halfway-tolerable relationship and an only-sometimes-maddening job. But this doesn\u2019t have to mean that they can never smile or appreciate what is beautiful or tender. Arguably, it\u2019s their awareness of a fundamental darkness that lends them the energy to pay particular attention to the brighter moments that will at points streak across the pitch-black firmament. The melancholy can be intensely grateful and sometimes giddily joyful because they know grief so well \u2013 not because they have never suffered at all. They can be very keen to dance (badly) and to make a great deal out of a sunny day or a perfect meal. A child will laugh because something is funny; a melancholy adult will laugh with greater depth still, because they know how many things are so sad.\n\nBeing disappointed isn\u2019t any sort of intellectual achievement, and nor is being merry. The real feat of character is to keep one\u2019s fury in check even though one is a bit broken, and maintain hope even though much is self-evidently wretched. In so far as the melancholy person can lay claim to any form of superior intelligence, it isn\u2019t because they have read a lot of books or dress fetchingly in black. It\u2019s because they have succeeded at finding the best possible accommodation between the infinite disappointments and occasional wonders of life.",

And if our state of mind were to remain gloomy, we would then be directed towards a psychiatrist who would play with our serotonin levels and aim to return us as quickly as possible to a state in which we would be able to join in with team sports, go to the office and honour our families and our duties to the state.\n\nPsychiatric drugs have \u2013 in certain circumstances \u2013 offered major breakthroughs. The worry is not so much a society that wants to help us with our sadness as one that cannot, beneath the surface, abide that we should sometimes legitimately need to weep.\n\nOne of the routine assumptions made about babies is that they should always and invariably be up for a laugh. A certain kind of stranger who visits may, therefore, rigidly try to get a giggle out of them, by jangling keys, pulling extreme faces or starting a game of peekaboo. It seems a well meaning thing to do, but babies \u2013 like adults \u2013 often have weighty and serious things on their minds. They might, at a given moment, be missing the womb or wondering when the next feed might be, trying to work out what a leaf is or reflecting on how a button is held in place. A \u2018jollying\u2019 grown-up isn\u2019t simply happy; their particular sickness is that they cannot tolerate unhappiness in others, even an eight-month-old, because it threatens to highlight areas of grief that they have not processed or learnt to absorb in themselves. The baby\u2019s thoughtful face is at risk of evoking for them important people they have lost and regrets they have never come to terms with \u2013 and so the keys get jangled with ever greater ferocity.\n\nA whole culture can, at scale, fall prey to a form of denied pain that passes itself off as good cheer. It may spend its time promoting vigour and triumph and leave aside how much in the life of everyone is also about loss, vulnerability and regret. In its eagerness to present a smiling face, a culture can fail to nurture rituals in which sadness can be mutualised, periods of nationwide mourning where a lot that is individually difficult can find collective expression and catharsis.\n\nFor example, birthdays shouldn\u2019t be framed \u2013 at the group level \u2013 purely as occasions for joy. They should be moments when what is incomplete can be confronted and sympathised with, in company. Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day shouldn\u2019t be about sheer gratitude and delight; these days must also allow for ambivalence and anger (sometimes even fury), for only thereafter can expressions of love feel genuine. Likewise, family holidays should never be presented as moments of total festivity; they are times when we must be able to squabble, sulk and face up to what is radically imperfect about where we have come from. Rather than being squeamish about difficulties, an intelligent culture holds our hand through, and helps us to name, the sad regions of life.\n\nZacharias Dolendo,Saturn as Melancholy, 1595\n\nBy being too quick to prescribe pills for sadness, a culture is at risk of missing the necessary nature of melancholy. The melancholic doesn\u2019t need \u2018solutions\u2019 to their pain so much as an opportunity to share its details with people who are kind, non-judgemental and a little broken themselves. They want pain to be normalised; company around sadness is the chief \u2018solution\u2019 they need. Pills deny the melancholic the chance to address the isolation that lurks behind their sad moods.\n\nBy framing the melancholic as \u2018ill\u2019 and separating them from the rest of humanity, medical culture offers no lasting help to those it seeks to treat. Previous eras, though they might have been less medically gifted, were more psychologically canny. In a charming and emotionally intelligent fable, they allowed those subject to black moods to tell others that they had been born under the sign of Saturn and, because of the influence of this planet, would not always be up for joining in the singing, coming out to parties or chatting merrily. They weren\u2019t ill, and they weren\u2019t mad. They were just in a \u2018saturnine phase\u2019 and hoped to feel a bit better soon.\n\nBy avidly prescribing pills for sadness, we are hinting that sadness does not belong within a decent life. Far more than any pill, what we crave in our melancholy state is a warm-hearted community that understands the sorrows of life and is kind enough to allow us to sit with our feelings for as long as they may require to pass.",

      "content": "## Loneliness & Melancholy\n\nIt remains unhelpfully difficult to be able to admit that one is lonely. Unless one has recently been widowed or just moved to a new city, there are no respectable-sounding explanations for why someone would find themselves without a sufficient number of friends. The idea quickly forms that a person\u2019s loneliness must be explained by something diseased and troubling within their character. If they are lonely, it is because there are things in their nature that merit them being left alone.\n\nYet in reality, what makes someone feel lonely isn\u2019t usually that they have no one at all they can be with, but that they don\u2019t know a sufficient number of people who could understand the more sincere and quirk-filled parts of themselves. A warm body with whom to have a meal isn\u2019t hard to find; there is always someone with whom one might have a chat about the weather. But loneliness doesn\u2019t end the moment one is talking with someone. It ends when a companion is able to follow us as we reveal our pains and sorrows.\n\nWe stop feeling lonely when, at last, someone is there to hear how perplexing sex remains, how frightening death is, how much envy one feels, how many supposedly small things spark anxiety, how much one sometimes hates oneself, how weepy one can be, how much regret one has, how self-conscious one feels, how complex one\u2019s relationship to one\u2019s parents is, how much unexplored potential one has, how odd one is about different parts of one\u2019s body and how emotionally immature one remains. It\u2019s the capacity to be honest about these potentially embarrassing and little-spoken-of sides of human nature that connects us to others and finally brings our isolation to an end.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that we have built a lonely modern world. If this is so, it has nothing to do with our busy working schedules or gargantuan cities. It has to do with the fictions we tell ourselves about what we\u2019re like. We trade in brutally simplified caricatures, which leave out so much of our real natures \u2013 so much of the pain, confusion, wildness and extremity. We\u2019re lonely because we can\u2019t easily admit to other people what we know we\u2019re really like. We tell stories about what we\u2019ve been up to lately that capture almost nothing of our truth \u2013 not because we are liars, but because we are ashamed of the gap between what we know of ourselves and what we are meant to be like. We\u2019re encouraged to present a cheerful, one-dimensional front from which everything awkward but essential has been planed off.\n\nA first step towards ending loneliness would be to open the more secret doors of our minds by ourselves and step into the sad, angry, envious or self-hating rooms \u2013 turn on the lights and examine the contents without prudishness or denial, shame or guilt. Then, when we are next with someone else, we should risk discussing what we have found.\n\nWe are lonely because we have collectively been slow to accept that we are delightfully strange and unhinged. We should allow ourselves to reveal more of who we really are to those with the imagination to listen, and to allow them to bring their own weirdness to the table in turn. Our loneliness will end with honesty.",

      "content": "## Achievement & Melancholy\n\nFor most of our lives, we\u2019re hard at work. We\u2019re up till midnight in the library studying for a degree, we\u2019re learning a trade, building a business, writing a book. We have hardly a moment to ourselves. We don\u2019t even ask whether we are fulfilled; it\u2019s simply obvious that this is the bit that has to hurt. We fall asleep counting the weeks until we are finished with our work.\n\nAnd then, finally, one day, slightly unexpectedly, the end arrives. Through slow and steady toil, we have achieved what we had been seeking for years: the book is done, the business is sold, the degree certificate is on the wall. People around us cheer and lay on a party; we might even take a holiday.\n\nThat is when, for those of us in the melancholy camp, unease is liable to descend. The beach is beautiful, the sky is flawless, there is a scent of lemon in the air from the orchard. We have nothing unpleasant to do. We can read, loll, play and dawdle. Why then are we so flat, disoriented and perhaps slightly tearful?\n\nThe mind works in deceptive ways. In order to generate the momentum required to prompt us to finish any task, our mind pretends that once the work is done, it will finally be content, and will accept reality as it is. It will cease its restless questions; it won\u2019t throw up random unease. It will be on our side.\n\nHowever, our mind isn\u2019t in any way well suited to honouring such promises. It turns out to be vehemently opposed to, and endangered by, states of calm and relaxation. It can manage them, at best, for a day or so. And then, with cold rigour, it will be on its way again with worries and questions. It will ask us once more to account for ourselves, to ask what the point of us is, to doubt whether we are worthy or decent, to question what right we have to be.\n\nOnce hard work ends, there is nothing to stop our melancholy minds from leading us to the edge of an abyss we had been able to resist so long as our heads were down. We start to feel that no achievement will ever, in fact, be enough, that nothing we do can last or make a difference, that little is as good as it should be, that we are tainted by a basic guilt of being alive, that others around us are far more noble and able than we will ever be, that the blue sky is oppressive and frightening in its innocence \u2013 and that \u2018doing nothing\u2019 is the hardest thing we ever have to do.\n\nPerhaps, deep down, the melancholy mind knows that the ultimate fate of the planet is to be absorbed by the Sun in 5 billion years and that everything is therefore vain, considered against a cosmological sense of time and space. We know that we are puny and irrelevant apparitions; we haven\u2019t been so much busy as protected from despair by deadlines, punishing schedules, work trips and late-night conference calls. A grossly inflated local sense of importance spared us a recognition of cosmic futility. But now, with the achievement secured, there is no defence left against existential terror. It is just us and, in the firmament above, the light of a billion billion dying stars. There are no more 8:30 a.m. meetings, no more revision notes and no more chapter deadlines to distract us from our metaphysical irrelevance.\n\nWe should be kinder to ourselves. Rather than putting ourselves through the infinitely demanding process of idling (as though a nervous, adrenaline-filled creature such as Homo sapiens could ever pull off such an implausible feat), we should be self-compassionate enough to keep setting ourselves one slightly irrelevant but well-camouflaged challenge after another \u2013 and do our very best to pretend that these matter inordinately and that there should be no sizeable gaps between them.\n\nOur work exists to protect us from a brutal sense of despair and angst. We should ensure that we never stop having tasks to do \u2013 and never make that most reckless of moves, taking a long holiday, or \u2013 god forbid \u2013 embark on a truly foolhardy scheme, retiring.",

      "content": "## Superfluity & Melancholy\n\nThe world is hardly short of people. Quite why it needs yet another example, and why that example should be someone like us (with all our flaws, compulsions and mediocrities), is one of the conundrums that especially haunt those of us beset by melancholy. For these mournful souls, the first-order questions are never far away. Why are we here? What have we contributed? Are we worthy enough? Wouldn\u2019t it be better for us not to have been born?\n\nIt is these harsh enquiries that reverberate in melancholy minds and lends them their characteristically deep, sad and self-doubting expressions.\n\nPerhaps the real puzzle isn\u2019t so much why some people doubt their existence as why certain others manage not to do so in any way. What lends these less sceptical characters their confidence that they have every right to be here? How do they manage to root their legs so firmly to the ground and why do they greet their face in the mirror with such a spirit of self-acceptance and vivid assurance? Why do they feast unquestioningly on the goodness of the Earth and never wonder if there hasn\u2019t, somewhere along the line, been some mistake?\n\nAt the root of the melancholic cast of mind there is likely to be a poignant psychological backstory in childhood: a lack of early love. No one who has been firmly and decisively wanted by those who put them on the Earth will ever doubt their essential right to be here. They will be permanently validated by the enthusiasm of their parents. These parents\u2019 songs and cuddles, laughter and care will strengthen them forever. They may suffer in all kinds of ways, and they won\u2019t be immune to a thousand pains and regrets that beset every human over the years, but they will never know the fundamental self-doubt that afflicts those whose parents didn\u2019t really want them. They will have a gift for speaking to themselves kindly and will look after their needs with tenderness during reversals. They will look benignly on their errors and forgive themselves in the way they were once forgiven. They will look after their own bodies and tuck themselves into bed in good time. They will suffer, but they won\u2019t hate themselves.\n\nHow different it is for the melancholic. In their childhood, it is likely no one was especially waiting for them to arrive; there was no emotional red carpet and no boundless admiration for their sweet toes and adorable eyelashes. No one was ready to lay down their life for their sake, or gaze at them with tender awe as they filled a bucket in the garden. A child doesn\u2019t have to be thrown into a dustbin to count as neglected. It may be regularly bathed and adequately dressed. There are subtler ways for an impression to form that one doesn\u2019t especially matter to anyone. The parents might have been very busy or the childminder often on the phone. Perhaps one\u2019s birth coincided with serious problems at the office. Or else a sibling got ill and there was only so much concern left over. Or maybe one was a bit difficult, slow and shy and the parent looked elsewhere in embarrassment.\n\nAll this is enough to kick-start a worldview. It could, by itself, make one into a philosopher, someone who spends their life raising troubling structural questions, starting with the most urgent of them all: why am I even here?\n\nIt sounds insulting to have to believe that seventy-five years of gloom and self-questioning might have its origin in a lack of cuddles or bedtime stories before the age of four. Nevertheless, we would do well to accept the power of so-called \u2018small things\u2019 to determine the course of our lives \u2013 no less than we should humbly acknowledge the power of microscopic cell division to determine our biological fates.\n\nEnthusiastic parental love is founded on a charming illusion: of course one doesn\u2019t \u2013 in the grander scheme \u2013 matter at all; of course one isn\u2019t especially cute or particularly worthy; naturally there isn\u2019t something fundamentally amazing about one\u2019s first steps or one\u2019s return home from school with a sticker for good behaviour in maths. Still, how pleasant and necessary for parents to weave around a child an aura of affection in order to inoculate them for life against stabs of self-doubt and self-hatred.\n\nWhat gives the melancholy their clear-eyed intelligence \u2013 and often their dark humour \u2013 is that they have never had any illusory veil thrown over them. They have had to look at matters pretty clearly from the start. They haven\u2019t trusted teachers or many friends, and they have been suspicious of casual declarations of love. They\u2019ve known how to be ironic and keep a keen eye out for pretension; such are the side benefits of not being too much on one\u2019s own side. The world is far more cruel, but also more interesting. And there will always be low moods when the whole thing doesn\u2019t seem worth it at all. That initial feeling of being unwanted persists forever. The great consolation is to know that we are not alone, that there is \u2013 blessedly \u2013 a silent community of people a bit like us, just waiting for art and friendship to bring us together.",

      "content": "## Photos & Melancholy\n\nTo those sensitive to melancholy, looking though an album of old photographs of ourselves is an especially poignant pastime.\n\nA few pages in, there we are in a large colour portrait: a smiling five-year-old, pulling a gap-toothed smile, extremely proud of having just completed a drawing of a submarine and some very happy-looking fish. We\u2019re wearing our favourite dungarees and our hair is unusually long. We\u2019re also \u2013 if we can say it ourselves \u2013 very cute.\n\nWe may be moved at the sight of this little person, but also \u2013 probably \u2013 deeply saddened as well. How much of life\u2019s suffering this tiny thing didn\u2019t yet know! How much pain they still had ahead of them! They had no clue \u2013 that sunny afternoon in the garden of the old house, a few hours before it would have been time for a bowl of animal-shaped pasta and a strawberry yogurt for tea \u2013 what fate had in store. How little they could suspect of the divorce, the move to the smaller house, the bullying, the loneliness, the unrequited love, the guilty feelings around sex, the career mishaps, the trouble with their health, the realities of marriage, the financial anxiety, the romantic betrayals, the tetchiness, the ugliness of age, the persistent anxiety and fear and the troubles of child-raising \u2026 to start a list that is in no way comprehensive or even especially ghastly (it can get much, much worse).\n\nWe\u2019re likely to realise, as we look at another photo of us attempting a cartwheel by a forest, that part of what keeps us going is the sheer fact of not knowing. We are kept alive by a brute biological appetite reliant on ignorance. But if we imagine being given the option of magically returning to being five again, knowing what we know now, we would most likely say a firm no. We aren\u2019t actively looking forward to death \u2013 we haven\u2019t got plans to end things prematurely \u2013 but we couldn\u2019t really bear to have our entire life again. Too many of our years have been spent in pain of one kind or another. There have been a few moments of fun and achievement, but, essentially, the score sheet has been too mixed to warrant another whole go. It\u2019s a melancholy realisation. Without our necessarily being fully aware of it, we don\u2019t find a great deal of what happens to us tolerable. There are too many days lost to anxiety and aggravation, self-doubt and alarm, loneliness and longing. We hate our lives more than we perhaps usually acknowledge. We want to go back and hug that little child for all the difficulties heading their way. We want to cry at their joyful innocence in a world which will make them suffer a lot.\n\nEven worse, this retrospective glance can make us question the future. Right now, we still retain certain hopes. We may be trying to make a new relationship work or devoting a lot of effort to a professional project. If the past is any indication, though, within a decade (if we\u2019re lucky enough to have it), we\u2019ll be looking at a photo of ourselves today with some of the same emotions as those we now feel looking back on the five-year-old version of ourselves. We\u2019ll be seeing someone similarly na\u00efve about what is to come, similarly innocent of difficulties, similarly overly excited given what is actually possible, given our nature and the conditions of life. Not only were we innocent in the past, but we are still fairly innocent about the future.\n\nMany photos feel bittersweet; that is, not plain dreadful, but tinged with something difficult or shameful. Take a photo of us with our grandmother. We must be around nine. We loved spending time with her, helping her in her garden and laying out our toys in her front room. We also know that when adolescence came, we stopped going to see her. She seemed embarrassing and we imagined she couldn\u2019t understand much of what we were feeling, though we never tried to explain. When she died, we hadn\u2019t been to see her in over a year. We\u2019re still cut up about it to this day, and ever more so as time passes.\n\nThen there\u2019s a shot of us with our first partner. We\u2019d been lonely for so long and, finally, they\u2019d taken us on. They were very kind to us \u2013 and obviously pretty young and fragile themselves. They look lovely, somewhere on the coast, with their hair blown about by a breeze, and their arm around us. We rented a little cabin and went for walks along the marshes. We rented some bikes the day before we left. Yet bitterness dogs us here too. After half a year or so, for reasons we still can\u2019t really understand, we told them it was over \u2013 and did so rather horribly. We were too embarrassed to be kind. We hurt them badly through fear. From the evidence on the internet, they seem pretty happily married now. They must hate us a lot. Sometimes, late at night, we wish we could call them up and tell them (though it sounds a bit mad) that we still love them.\n\nThen there\u2019s a shot of us at university with a group of friends. It looks as though we\u2019re having fun. There\u2019s the guy whose name we can\u2019t even remember who was always putting on funny accents and once almost crashed his mother\u2019s car. There\u2019s the gloomy, clever physicist we loved talking to. How little we made of those precious years! We should have been more honest about what we actually felt. We should have dared to be a genuine friend to the others.\n\nWe start to realise how much of life has been less than we would have hoped. We aren\u2019t necessarily crying, but as we shut the photo album, we are one thing for sure: sad in the distinctive way we best call melancholy.",

      "content": "## The Womb & Melancholy\n\nLet us return to young children. It seems appropriate that the world\u2019s most famous baby should have been melancholy. Though Jesus went on to have a very unusual and especially tragic destiny, there is a universal theme in his story, and that is what may touch us when we see him depicted as a child. Like all of us, he is sad \u2013 in part \u2013 because he has been forced to leave the womb.\n\nThis sounds odd, and it is meant to. After all, none of us ever remembers being in the womb; we don\u2019t go around with any active sense of nostalgia for our first home. The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein speculated that this was no coincidence: if we remembered the womb, then our sorrow for what we had been forced to give up and our dissatisfaction with our present circumstances might reach such a pitch, it would be too intense to bear. We have to forget what we once had as a price for having the courage to continue.\n\nNevertheless, it may be helpful to think of ourselves as still somewhere pining for the womb. By this, one means pining for a time when we were not so incomplete, a time when we didn\u2019t need to be afraid, when we didn\u2019t have apprehensions about the future, when we were fused with someone else, when every one of our needs was magically catered for by blood pumping through a rubbery cable, whose stub remains on our front as a reminder of that original severance.\n\nWorkshop of Giovanni Bellini,Madonna and Child. c. 1510\n\nSandro Botticelli, Madonna and Child, c. 1470\n\nWe may be nostalgic without knowing what for, nostalgic for a womb we have forgotten. There are moments of great closeness and comfort in adult life. Occasionally, we may be in a very tender person\u2019s arms; sometimes, someone cooks us a deeply tasty meal. But what can the most devoted lover offer us in terms of reassurance, or the most assiduous restaurant or hotel give us in terms of sensitivity to our needs, as compared with what was once on offer in our first home?\n\nGiven that we may be privately \u2013 and unconsciously \u2013 judging our adult experiences against the measure of very early perfection, it\u2019s no wonder if we often feel a bit dissatisfied and disconsolate. The biblical story of the expulsion from paradise is really a version of the story of our own birth. We all were once in a place where we didn\u2019t have to ask for anything, where nourishment came to us automatically and where we were in the hands of a kindly immense being.\n\nNo wonder many babies look a bit sad: they have lost so much. The religious are lucky, for they are offered a chance to return \u2018home\u2019 in the next life. For the secular melancholic, though, there is no pathway home. The lonely pilgrimage goes on forever. At least, if we are able to name the place we\u2019d so love to return to, we may help ourselves to understand the scale (and the impossibility) of our desire. We should admit how much \u2013 despite all the advantages of adult life \u2013 we still really miss the womb.",

We melancholics know well enough what we\u2019re meant to care about: careers, money, the opinions of the community, the latest stories in the news, our identities in the eyes of others, where the economy is headed in the next decade. We know the purported significance, but we may also \u2013 in a private part of our minds \u2013 not care very much at all.\n\nWe\u2019re not merely cold or unfeeling. We\u2019ve just ended up prone to seeing our species and our planet from a less human-centric perspective. Our eyes naturally settle not on what is directly in front of us but on how we might appear from 6 billion kilometres away. We\u2019re thinking not of what tomorrow will bring, but of how the present moment might seem in relation to the age of the Earth.\n\nThe natural place to take such feelings of disengagement is not \u2013 as society sometimes tells us \u2013 a psychotherapist\u2019s chair, but rather our planetariums and our departments of astronomy, our charts of the lunar surface and our galleries of images from the Voyager space probes. We may redeem our melancholic intuitions by studying the swirls of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 236,000,000,000,000,000 kilometres from the Sun, or photographs of late afternoon on the Aeolis Palus plain of Mars. Astronomy is the true friend of the melancholy mind; NASA and the European Space Agency are its presiding deities.\n\nPluto as viewed by the New Horizonsspacecraft, 2015\n\nThrough our immersion in space, our alienated perspectives can be confirmed and returned to us with dignity. We are allowed to anchor our disengagement from the human drama to passing meteorites or the moons of Jupiter. Our loneliness can find a true home on the vast silent dune fields of Sputnik Planitia on the southern hemisphere of Pluto. Some of our sense of loss can be absorbed by the asteroid-pockmarked surface of the Moon. Our insignificance can be framed within the context of the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the observable universe.\n\nPlanetariums may seem to be trying to show us the stars in order to equip us with the knowledge we\u2019d require to become astronauts or physicists one day. In truth, they offer us a means by which to diminish ourselves in our own eyes; they are a tool with which to take the sting out of our nagging sense of unimportance and our frustration at our modest achievements and sense of isolation.\n\nThere can be good reasons for us to strive to live in the here and now. But there may be yet more powerful reasons to dwell for at least part of the day in the Proterozoic age of the Earth, between 2,500 million and 542 million years ago, when single-celled eukaryotes developed deep in the silence of giant, undisturbed oceans. We don\u2019t need to blame ourselves unduly if we feel at odds with our nagging fellow humans when we can establish imaginary companionship with some of the many wondrous forms in which life has manifested itself across planetary history, like the beguiling-looking Psittacosaurus parrot lizard who lived over 100 million years ago, or the dog-sized, tuft-tailed, two-legged Chaoyangsaurus who roamed the earth around 150 million years ago.\n\nThe best consolation for our sadness at how little ever works out is to cheer ourselves with the thought that the average stable lifespan of a star is only 10 billion years and that our Sun has already burnt for just under half of that. Soon enough, this middle-aged star\u2019s increased brightness will cause our oceans to evaporate, then it will run out of hydrogen and become a red giant star, expanding as far as Mars and absorbing the whole of our planet, including the atoms of everyone and everything that is annoying us so much today.\n\nWe should drown our tears in the ocean of suffering to which every living thing is subject. We should align our feelings of purposelessness with detailed news of the five mass extinctions to have befallen the planet. To every reversal, we should simply answer that there are 40 billion planetary systems at large in the universe. Before every anxiety-inducing date or speech, we should mutter to ourselves, like a talismanic prayer, that the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across and that the most distant known galaxy is GN-z11, 32 billion light years from the restaurant or conference centre.\n\nThe melancholy mind often suspects that everything may be a bit meaningless. Through astronomy, we can discover, in the most engaging and inadvertently life-affirming way possible, why and how it truly is exactly that.",

      "content": "## Landscape & Melancholy\n\nAs inhabitants of the modern world, we spend the major part of our lives in ugliness: under polluted leaden skies, among choked motorways, warehouses, freight depots and graffitied, shuttered shops. These environments continuously whisper to us that we are worthy of ridicule, and perhaps, that we should swiftly go home and hide under the bed clothes.\n\nThen, on a few rare occasions, we end up somewhere extremely beautiful. We might have arrived at the old farmhouse late last night and only now, in the early morning, do we have a chance to see where we really are. We open the heavy, rusty shutters and take in the vista before us: soft rolling hills dotted with dark green cypress trees, fields of lavender and poppies, a limestone village on the horizon, a little church in the middle of an orchard, a stream below the house, bordered with weeping willows and clumps of bluebells \u2026 all of it emerging under flawless azure skies, as though none of us had ever been expelled from paradise and there was no such thing as death or pain. Someone forgot to tell this part of the world about human tragedy.\n\nWe feast on the scene and let the sun warm our face. It seems like the most exquisite setting we have ever seen or, perhaps, visited since we were children. And to think that only yesterday we were in our city apartment, looking at a rain-stained concrete wall opposite, the windows reverberating to the sounds of lorries idling at the lights below.\n\nWe should be happy, and in a way we are. Very happy. A farmer is leading some goats across the valley. A couple of children are cycling towards the village. But the beauty has also edged us into melancholy. We aren\u2019t sad because it isn\u2019t beautiful enough, but precisely because it is so beautiful \u2013 a kind of beauty we cannot bear to have been away from for so long and to have to live in exile from for most of our lives.\n\nBeauty has served to highlight the ugliness that came before. We notice, in a way we couldn\u2019t yesterday, how much disappointment, violence, meanness and humiliation exist in our ordinary surroundings and routines. Thanks to the little limestone church (that we\u2019ll visit after breakfast) assembled by craftsmen around 1430, we\u2019re finally in a position to feel how much agony is latent in our hearts. We haven\u2019t been pain-free all this time. We\u2019ve just been numb, holding in our sorrow because there was nowhere to discharge it, because there were no alternatives to it and nothing to remind us of the scale of our compromise.\n\nThe beauty of the landscape is like the very kind friend who, after a period of turmoil, puts a hand gently on ours and asks how we have been, and does so with such tenderness and intelligent concern that we surprise ourselves by bursting into tears that don\u2019t stop for a very long time. It can take kindness to make us realise how much suffering we were holding in. It can take beauty to make us realise how ugly things have become.\n\nOf course, we want to move here. Somehow. We plot \u2013 as we have plotted so many times before, always in vain \u2013 how we might be able to throw in the job, sell the apartment and spend our remaining years in a little cottage. Every morning we would wake up to this and head out to fetch a newspaper and pastries. We also know it will never happen, and this is part of the mounting sadness. We have been reminded of a better way of living and, simultaneously, of our brute-headed inability to change our lives.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the physical beauty that\u2019s touching us, it\u2019s everything that the beauty speaks of: confidence, clarity, ambition, virtue. Why have we drifted so far from all the values we hold dear? How have we allowed ourselves to lose sight of what matters? We are crying because this is where we belong and yet cannot find our way to. Our plane leaves the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe don\u2019t begin to know how to do such beauty justice. We are so trained in the arts of resignation, disappointment and surrender, we are such masters at defeat, that this offering embarrasses us. We take a stream of photographs, but they aren\u2019t really what we are after. We want to become somebody else, not just take photos of a valley.\n\nThat\u2019s why, on top of everything else, in one of the nicest places on Earth, we manage to be sad. Someone comes in and sees our eyes filled with tears. They wonder sweetly if they could fetch us anything to eat or a taxi to go sightseeing, but we are far stranger than we can begin to explain. We are crying tears of joy at a goodness we have missed out on; we are crying at the sight of a happiness we are emotionally too cowardly and inept to know how to make our own. We are crying because we don\u2019t want to be tourists; we want to be reborn.",

      "content": "## Introversion & Melancholy\n\nThe melancholy person will, almost by definition, probably also be an introvert. The modern world purports to respect both introverts and their opposites but, in practice, the action, the rewards and the glamour are all precisely designed to synchronise with the talents and sensibilities of those in the extroverted camp. To have any chance of seeming normal or achieving success, one must pull off a range of feats to which extroverts seem inherently well suited: impress strangers, attend conferences, make speeches, outshine competitors, manage people, join in with prevailing enthusiasms, reflect public opinion, socialise, travel a lot, go out often and date widely.\n\nIt can take a very long time before we realise that \u2013 however much we might hope for it to be otherwise \u2013 this is not, in fact, us at all. For our part, we happen to get very worried before going to parties; we have felt close to death before giving speeches; any kind of social occasion perturbs us heavily; we\u2019re left extremely jittery by encounters with news and social media; we start to feel sick if we haven\u2019t had the chance to sit on our own and process our thoughts for a few hours every day; new places (especially bedrooms) worry us hugely; we\u2019re very awkward about having to be responsible for anyone at work; and we are extremely wary of jolliness or demonstrations of group fervour of any kind. We don\u2019t actively hate hugs, but our bodies do stiffen when someone rushes forward to embrace us.\n\nConversely, we adore staying at home; we\u2019d be quite happy spending a whole weekend (or even a few years) in our own company with some books and a laptop; we only properly like about three people in the world; we love exploring different rooms in our minds; we are reassured by friends who know how to confess their vulnerability and anxiety; we\u2019d like never to have to go to a party again; we almost never complain that things are too quiet; and we love peaceful landscapes and uneventful days. We quite like flowers too.\n\nAll of this can bring intense suspicion to bear on us in the modern world. Why are we so timid? Why can\u2019t we sing along with everyone else? Why aren\u2019t we coming out to celebrate? We conclude that we are weird, and possibly ill, long before we can accept that we may just be very different.\n\nTo be a melancholic introvert is to be constantly impacted by the \u2018small things\u2019 that others may miss. What can make a party or a company meeting so exhausting for us is that we aren\u2019t merely expressing our thoughts and chatting. We\u2019ll wonder what everyone has made of what we\u2019ve just said; we\u2019ll suspect that we have failed to understand an important dynamic; we\u2019ll be struck by a peculiar possible hostility from someone in the corner; we\u2019ll worry that our face has stuck in an unfortunate, gormless position. We are \u2013 when called upon \u2013 canny observers of the human comedy, but minute by minute, we are also exhaustingly self-conscious.\n\nWe long for connection, but relationships are a minefield, especially at the start. What do they really think of us? Are we allowed to express desire for them? Are they disgusted by us? No wonder if we prefer to stay at home with a book.\n\nIt sounds difficult, but an introverted life can also be a very grateful and rich one. We need so much less in order to have enough. We don\u2019t require noise and attention. We don\u2019t care where the giant party is. We just want to potter around in our boring clothes, chat to the few people we feel comfortable with, take walks and lie in the bath a lot. There can be so much in things when we let them resonate properly. How much we\u2019ve already seen; how many journeys we\u2019ve already been on; how much we\u2019ve already read; what tumults we\u2019ve already been through. We don\u2019t really need more. An introvert is someone prepared properly to take on board what an event or another person is \u2013 all that is daunting, powerful, resonant, beautiful or terrifying in experience.\n\nSmall children are natural introverts. When a stranger comes into the room, they instinctively turn to nestle in the bosom of their caregiver. And who can blame them, given how huge this new person is and how odd they sound and how much they want to go straight into a conversation, instead of spying warily for a while, as would feel so much more natural. These children also don\u2019t need too much stimulation from outside: playing with the lid of a cardboard box for a while is fascinating. They can have a lot of fun gazing at raindrops chasing each other down the window. They can lie on the floor in their bedroom and draw one version of a tree after another and not even notice it\u2019s already bath time. Also, they get exhausted easily: an hour at a lively birthday party and it\u2019s imperative to go straight home for a nap.\n\nRecognising our melancholic introverted nature is not merely a piece of poetic self-knowledge. It belongs to our mental health \u2013 for failing to make the correct accommodation with our introversion is a fast route to overload and ensuing anxiety and paranoia. What we term a breakdown is often simply an introverted mind crying out for greater peace, rest, self-compassion and harmony. Experienced introverts, therefore, realise a need to push against the extroverted agenda. Their sanity relies on being able to cleave to the insular routines they require. We have at least got a vocabulary for explaining the structure of our personalities to others. The next step will be to learn how to honour it, and properly allow people to lead the quieter lives their temperaments deserve.",

      "content": "## Sex & Melancholy\n\nSex is a time, first and foremost, of great honesty. For most of our lives, we must dissemble and pretend, hide and compromise. We cannot reveal most of our true desires or wishes, but must proceed in terror that we might somewhere along the line cause grave offence or be thought peculiar and damnable.\n\nBut at last, in bed with someone we truly like and who likes us back with equal sincerity, we can let our guard down. There\u2019s no longer any need to pretend. This is as private and as intimate as it will ever get. One can finally do what one has \u2013 in a little corner of one\u2019s mind \u2013 been aching to do for so long: perhaps act in a totally submissive way or explore a ruthless, uncompromising side; dress in the clothes of another gender; or start uttering a litany of obscene and taboo phrases one would also like the partner to repeat carefully. What one chooses to be honest about will vary; the dream is always that one can land on something that feels especially significant and hitherto blocked by the rules of propriety.\n\nThe melancholy person approaches the honesty available in sex from a very particular angle. They are perhaps not especially interested in ropes or leather, in studs or fur collars. They may feel turned on by something altogether more distinctive: crying.\n\nThe most fundamental fact for the melancholic is that life is filled with unending pain, almost all of which they must hide. They cannot normally explain the scale of the distress they felt in childhood, the disappointments of adolescence, the fear and exhaustion of their careers, the frustrations and tetchiness of their relationships, the difficulties with their families, the existential terror they experience in the night, the unease they are hounded by at almost every moment \u2026 They are, somewhere in the background, carrying an intolerable sack of weariness and grief. Most of the time, they can\u2019t let on. They\u2019re good at smiling; they are accomplished people-pleasers. But the sadness doesn\u2019t go away. It lingers a millimetre below the emotional epidermis, looking out for occasions \u2013 it is often a poem or a photograph \u2013 when it might briefly emerge.\n\nYet now, in the bedroom with a sensitive soul, someone who is beautiful not because of what they look like but because of how they interpret and digest pain, what feels most urgent (alongside everything physical) isn\u2019t to whip or command, pull hair or shout, but to break down in tears. Tears at how hard it\u2019s been for so many decades, how brave one has had to seem, how many struggles one has swallowed. One is making love, and at the same time, weeping because no one has ever understood until now and because one has been endlessly humiliated, overlooked and terrified. And because it might, for a while, perhaps be over.\n\nIdeally, the partner is doing much the same. They have likewise brought their grief to the bedroom \u2013 and both lovers are exchanging the most generous of gifts: an honest response to the shittiness of being alive. There is no longer a fear of vulnerability. Their physical nakedness is as nothing next to the emotional equivalent they\u2019re demonstrating. They are more honest than they have ever been and it\u2019s the most erotic moment of their lives.\n\nThe eroticism is key. The crying isn\u2019t just tender, it\u2019s actively a turn on; what we find erotic so often comprises an emotion we respect but have been cut off from for too long in ordinary life. The tears are exciting us because they are a symbol of long-lost honesty.\n\nThere are some very graceful and, no doubt, very attractive optimistic people, who could be exceptionally interesting lovers. A melancholy partner, however, will always have one big advantage over them: they know how to combine orgasms and tears.\n\nIt\u2019s because melancholics have, until now, been so shy about their orientations that the taste for sad sex has not been as prominent as it might have been. But as melancholy becomes more well known, more of us may start to discover a buried longing to be extremely happy with a lover because, in the close semi-darkness, we and they can finally give way to ecstatic sadness.",

      "content": "## Post-Coitus & Melancholy\n\nIf sex were as easy as our society sometimes suggests, we\u2019d expect not to feel appreciably any different after, as opposed to before, the act. As it is, for many of us, what we go through immediately following orgasm isn\u2019t so much closeness or joy as a very particular kind of sadness, one all the more lonely and peculiar because it seems so hard to talk about without sounding ungrateful or mean. We may \u2013 in the aftermath of one of life\u2019s most pleasurable sensations \u2013 be thrown into intense post-coital melancholy.\n\nAs we lie in the semi-darkness, with our partner breathing gently beside us, sleep may elude us. Our minds may scour the inner landscape, refusing to let consciousness go. We may be alert and at the same time panicky, heavy and sad. How could something so joyful have precipitated such sorrow?\n\nAt the root of much post-coital melancholy is a shame as to how we have ended up in bed like this. Sex can stir up passions which are deeply at odds with our daily conduct and beliefs. In the name of sex, an otherwise sober and gentle person will beg to be tied up and flogged; a generally exceptionally loyal and careful person will violate every marital vow; in a noisy nightclub, an intelligent and thoughtful soul will spend hours chatting with a companion with whom they have no deeper connection.\n\nThe instant orgasm has occurred, the bad faith one has been involved in comes to light. In past ages, this would have been the moment to head to the church or temple. One would plunge oneself into holy water or say some ritual words of atonement to a grave-faced priest. We may scoff at such superstition, but these divine rituals existed for a reason: in their way, they recognised both the deep pull of the erotic and the contradictory claims of our higher minds. They were sympathetic to how strongly good people may long for dignity, fidelity and wisdom and yet simultaneously be drawn towards degeneracy and vice.\n\nOur first experience of melancholic sexual guilt probably came in adolescence. As children, we might have been uncomplicatedly sweet; we could have told our mother everything; our favourite activity might have been horse-riding or playing with our trains. Then suddenly, we needed constantly to lock ourselves in the bathroom and think obsessively of certain scenarios. No sooner were we done than a darkness settled in on us which has \u2013 in many ways \u2013 never left us.\n\nThe melancholy and shame come especially to the fore after being with someone we don\u2019t particularly love, yet who might love us a lot. How could we, for the sake of a few moments of pleasure, act in such an amoral way? We might hope that we could turn to the kindly partner whose body we have lusted after and confess our inconsistency and lies and ask that they might absolve us of our transgression: how much we might feel for them if only they could understand that we didn\u2019t, despite what just happened, have any of the right feelings for them \u2026\n\nIn post-coital exhaustion, we become aware of how much time we have squandered on sexual adventure. In the hours we have wasted scheming and plotting, we might have finished a script, written a business plan or sent in a university paper. We might have been looking after some small children who begged us to be back by bath time.\n\nWhat we wish for more than anything is reassurance that we remain, despite everything, a sweet enough human being \u2013 just one with a complicated set of imperatives to juggle. We are melancholic after a certain kind of sex because we wish our lives could be simpler; we wish that sex didn\u2019t pull us in contrary directions; we wish that we could only ever love and desire the same person.",

      "content": "## History & Melancholy\n\nEven though history is filled with stories of terrible events (wars, massacres, etc.), many people still manage to believe in progress. They trust that things broadly get better and that humanity has a bright future ahead of it.\n\nHowever, melancholic people are not able to share this kind of optimism. When they look at the past, they see a degree of horror and pain they can\u2019t get over. In particular, they are conscious that many civilisations have existed that were brutally snuffed out \u2013 even though they would have had so much to give us.\n\nThe melancholy mind is drawn to moments when history appears to confirm a thesis familiar from individual life: that the best do not typically win, that the prizes often go to the undeserving and that a nobility of spirit can lead to an inability to summon up the strength to defeat an aggressive enemy. In the ruins of old civilisations, the melancholy observe a moral tale about the fate of virtue and honour in a rough world.\n\nThe melancholy may, for example, turn their thoughts to Britain at the start of the 5th century. There were symmetrically laid out towns in Verulamium (St Albans), Lindum (Lincoln) and Eboracum (York). There were limestone and marble baths at Aquae Sulis (Bath). Shops sold amphorae filled with olive oil from southern Spain and wine from Gaul; you could buy salted fish from Greece and preserved olives from Sicily. There was a high degree of order and some justice. And then in a few short years, four centuries of Roman rule in Britain came to a sorry end. The German tribes moved forward irresistibly across the Rhine, politics in Rome grew especially treacherous and the legions were abruptly summoned back to the centre. In villas around Britain, there was no time to make adequate preparations. Marauding bands of Saxons, Picts and Scotti looted and destroyed everything in sight. Much was laid to waste without any identifiable benefit to the invaders, perhaps simply to lessen their intimidation in the face of so much refinement. Anyone identified with Roman rule was at risk. In the chaos, fleeing families buried valuables in their gardens, in the vain hope that Rome might one day recover, and they would be able to return and restart their lives.\n\nThere were to be no hot baths again in Britain for twelve centuries and no more classical buildings for 1,235 years. People stopped using money and went back to bartering; the roads fell into disrepair; the towns emptied. Four-storey stone buildings with porticos and Corinthian columns gave way to thatched wooden huts.\n\nOne imagines how different it could have been if Roman rule had been able to unwind more gradually, with less rage and violence on the part of the conquerors. Had things worked out otherwise, people might have been reading Ovid and Seneca in Pons Aelius (Newcastle) in the 6th century or taking hot baths under Doric arches in Durocornovium (Swindon) in the reign of King Offa of Mercia in the 8th century; there would have been no Dark Ages and no thousand-year wait for a Renaissance. Christianity might not have needed to impose itself with such savagery. In Rome, there would have been no impulse to smash up the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the middle of the Forum, and then crudely insert a church inside it and call it progress.\n\nThe melancholic feel sorry for all that has been lost. They can daydream about how different the Americas would have been if that fierce Spanish adventurer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had been shipwrecked off Cuba in the late summer of 1519 and had not had the chance to butcher his way to the capital of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan. A city of gardens and lakes, it was home to up to 400,000 inhabitants, the largest conurbation in the world at that time, and one of its most educated and decorous, filled with botanical gardens, arenas for playing ullamaliztli games, ordered residential districts and bustling markets selling slabs of dark chocolate, sweet cornbread, multicoloured parrots and the skins of jaguars. One wishes that this civilisation had managed to spend longer undisturbed under the rule of Emperor Moctezuma and his heirs, and so would have been able to acquire the horses, steel swords and biological immunity required to meet the West on its terms. Tenochtitlan might now be one of the great urban tapestries of the world, the Paris or Kyoto of Mesoamerica, its culture harmonised with modernity. It would be reachable by a fleet of advanced jetliners based at Etzalcualiztli International Airport that would have, painted on their tails (in a nostalgic throwback respected by modern Aztecs in the same way that an American might think of Abraham Lincoln), a rendering of Huitzilopochtli, father of the nation and god of war and the Sun.\n\nOne might likewise wish that the Nasrid dynasty that controlled the Emirate of Granada had not met such a definitive end in 1492; that Muhammad XII could have brokered a deal with Queen Isabella I of Castile and that this enlightened nation, administered from the intricately decorated chambers of the Alhambra Palace, could have continued to be a centre of learning, a home for multiple faiths and a centre for mathematics and poetry. One might no less wish that the Republic of Venice could have held out against the French in 1797 and, rather than becoming a quaint historical curiosity, could have remained a dynamic, independent city state, dedicated to business and the arts, the Singapore of the Adriatic. We can imagine its logo, the lion of St Mark, proudly emblazoned on the sides of its electric ships and online trading portals.\n\nHow much more interesting and less internally troubled the North American continent might have been if the European conquerors\u2019 westward progress had been stopped by treaty at the Rocky Mountains, after which travellers would still now be entering the territory of the Shoshone and the Paiutes, the Navajo and the Apache. What a useful counter to American exceptionalism it would have been if there were a low-rise Goshute metropolis near where Salt Lake City now stands; if, in place of San Francisco, there might be the Pomo Indian capital of Kunula (named after their sacred coyote); and if, all over the West, fast food outlets served dishes based on acorns, pumpkin and the flesh of cactuses.\n\nThe melancholy mind appreciates that it isn\u2019t the best, the cleverest or the most deserving who invariably win; it tends to be those most dedicated to slaughter, rule-bending and aggression \u2013 and (in many cases) those who have had the good fortune to live in a region with large tameable mammals to ride into battle and a 200-year head start in making gunpowder. Beneath a triumphalist narration of history, a far sadder idea emerges: that one can be noble and yet defeated. Also, and more hopefully, we may see that there can be such a thing as an honourable failure, a failure which demonstrates greater virtues of character than success, because it is founded on unusual reserves of honesty, imagination and tolerance. We have plenty to learn from some of the so-called \u2018losers\u2019 of history, not so much about realpolitik and power play, as about the sort of lives it might be truly civilised to lead.",

People who are genuinely good, people who know about kindness, patience, forgiveness, compromise, apology and gentleness always, always answer: no.\n\nOne cannot both be a good person and at the same time feel totally blameless and pure inside. Goodness is, one might say, the unique consequence of a keen awareness of one\u2019s capacity to be bad: that is, to be thoughtless, cruel and self-righteous. The price of being genuinely good has to be a constant suspicion that one might be a monster \u2013 combined with a fundamental hesitation about labelling anyone else monstrous.\n\nOnly properly bad people don\u2019t lie awake at night worrying about their characters. It has generally never occurred to the most difficult or dangerous people on the planet that they might be awful.\n\nIt is a grim paradox that the worst deeds that humans have ever been guilty of have been carried out by people with an easy conscience, people who felt they were definitely on the side of angels.\n\nThe melancholy have advanced knowledge of their impurity, and are experts in their own sinfulness. They can\u2019t forget how silly they have been at many moments and with what lack of thought they have treated others. This self-knowledge isn\u2019t fun, but it keeps them very honest.\n\nOne of history\u2019s most melancholy figures was also one of the kindest. In chapter 8 of the Gospel of Saint John, Jesus has recently come down from Galilee to Jerusalem when some Pharisees, members of a sect focused on precise adherence to Jewish tradition and law, present him with a married woman whom they have caught having sex with someone other than her husband. \u2018Teacher,\u2019 they ask him, \u2018this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. In our law, Moses commanded that such a woman must be stoned to death. Now what do you say?\u2019\n\nJesus is being edged into a trap. Will he say that it is completely fine to have an affair (in other words, to condone something that one\u2019s society regards as sexually very wrong)? Or will the mild-mannered preacher of love and forgiveness turn out to be just as strict about legal matters as the Jewish authorities he liked to criticise? Jesus makes a deft move. He doesn\u2019t categorically deny the mob the right to stone the woman to death \u2013 but he adds one apparently small, but in practice epochal, caveat to this right. They can kill and destroy her to their hearts\u2019 content if, but only if, they can be absolutely sure that they have first satisfied one crucial criterion: they have never done anything wrong themselves.\n\nImportantly, by this Jesus doesn\u2019t mean if they have never slept around outside of their marriage. He means if they have never done anything wrong at all, whatsoever, across any area of their lives. Only absolute moral purity grants us the right to be vicious, high-handed and unsparing towards transgressors. An important principle of ethics is being introduced: we are to be counted as properly innocent not when we are blameless in this or that area, but when we have done nothing wrong whatsoever, at any point and in any context. If we have, if we have slipped up in any field, even one very far removed from the crime at hand, then we are duty bound to stretch our powers of empathy, to strive to identify with the wrongdoer and to show them an advanced degree of mercy and charity. We may not have committed that particular crime, but we are implicated in sin more generally \u2013 and therefore must forgive. Jesus responds to the Pharisees with what have become immortal words: \u2018Let him who is without sin cast the first stone \u2026\u2019 The mob, understanding the rebuke, put down their projectiles and the terrified woman is spared.\n\nThe real target of this story is a perennial problem in the human soul: self-righteousness. Jesus\u2019s point is that the surest way to be kind is not to take pride in never having done a particular species of wrong. It lies in seeing that, inevitably, we too have been foolish and cruel at other moments, and in using that knowledge to foster compassion towards those whom it lies in our powers to \u2018stone\u2019. A world in which we keep our own wrongs firmly in mind will be a very melancholy world; it will also be an exceptionally kind one.",

      "content": "## Crushes & Melancholy\n\nWe\u2019re in a queue at the supermarket; we\u2019re in the reading room at the library; we\u2019re in a corner seat of a train carriage; we\u2019re standing at the lights at a busy city intersection. Without warning, it happens: the immediate recognition, the sense of certainty, the start of the longing. Unobserved, we take in every detail: their ear lobes, the way their hair falls, the colour of their eyes, their wrists. We can imagine so much more: the stumbling but delighted first hello, the early dates, a walk in the park, the hesitant first touch of our hands, the initial tender kiss, a trip to the seaside, moving in, marriage, two sparky yet always adorable children. We sense the tenor of their soul: their kindness, sense of adventure, playfulness and good nature. We feel how much we would agree on other people, on politics, interior design, ways of travelling and of handling finances. We know they would share our joys and sympathise with our sorrows. Sometimes they would tease us or upbraid us a little, but we would know how right they were and how much we wanted to improve for them. We love the thoughtful way they are leaning slightly forward now and imagine lifting their hair and caressing the nape of their neck. We would so enjoy helping them with their difficulties, perhaps a troublesome parent or a worry at work, and would let them into our own struggles in turn. We worry that someone might be able to open our minds and see all we are thinking, but there is (as yet) no law against the silent work of our insane imaginations. We\u2019re keeping a very blank expression. If anything, we look almost emphatically disinterested in the world around us, even as, deep in our frontal lobe, we picture how we and our lover would together decorate the living room of our new apartment or log cabin. Then, as quickly as it began, the lights change, the train pulls into a station, they get up from the reading room desk, they swerve into the bagged salad aisle \u2013 and our hearts break.\n\nThere is paradox, and a high degree of madness, at play. Firstly, that we would do so little to approach a stranger whom we felt so intensely might be our destiny. Wouldn\u2019t it be normal to try to smile at them? Shouldn\u2019t we at least attempt to look at them directly? No, we would prefer to be thrown into a boiling cauldron. We dwell in permanent terror of bothering anyone. Hardwired into us is an advanced dread of causing the most remote inconvenience to another and, beneath this, a conviction of how unacceptable we essentially are. We love the stranger far too much to burden them with our fundamentally crooked selves.\n\nSecondly, there is madness in spinning baroque tales around the outward form of an unknown being. We need to get to know someone slowly, refuse to project our longings onto a blank canvas and accept that love isn\u2019t an immoderate hope foisted onto the charming exterior of an unwitting innocent, but a process of slowly understanding a person\u2019s actual character with realism and downbeat patience. We understand that this habit of ours must spring from a very broken part of our nature: it must be a symptom of a fear of intimacy and a sign of an incapacity for true fulfilment. It\u2019s ultimately just a fancy way of staying very lonely.\n\nBut this is the true madness: though we know all this, and would always proclaim as much in sensible company, we don\u2019t \u2013 in our heart of hearts \u2013 believe any of it. When we can be honest with ourselves, we insist, against all the evidence, that the sensation we experienced on the train or in the supermarket, in the library or on the city street was not a delirious adolescent fantasy or an unreliable hormonal rush based on our traumatised early lives: it was love.\n\nWe know a lot about the mature forms of love that psychologists lecture us about; we may even have tried very hard to believe in them and put them into practice. We might be in a very sensible relationship already. What we experience in the face of the entrancing stranger, however, tells us that we remain, despite hours of emotional education, boundlessly romantic and entirely impervious to the call of logic or maturity. We know we should love only those we know well, only those who requite our desires and match our personality profiles. Yet we can\u2019t stop aching for the stranger we last saw on the platform. We\u2019re still thinking of them days later, and we would still now be able to evoke their facial features and personalities as we knew them to be from looking at the back of their shoes. We feel closer to love with these people \u2013 after a minute at the bus stop \u2013 than we do with many we\u2019ve known for decades. With the others, we pretend. Here we are spontaneously and exquisitely overwhelmed.\n\nWe\u2019re too familiar with the demands of respectable life to let on. When people ask us where we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ll report on the external movements, not the peregrinations of our demented minds. There are plenty of grave people lined up to tell us how silly all this is. It may well be that, and worse, but a resistant part of us wants to hold on to a more stubborn, beautiful and melancholy truth: that, despite everything, this crush belonged to the truest love we have ever known. We are members of a strange and shameful melancholy minority: those whose most profound and intense love affairs are with people they have never spoken to.",

      "content": "## Parties & Melancholy\n\nParties can be especially melancholic occasions. From the moment we arrive at most of them, we\u2019ll notice that intense efforts have been made to generate a welcoming and sociable atmosphere. Someone will have rigged up a sound system; there might be balloons bouncing around the ceiling; drinks may be brightly coloured. More significantly, some extremely well-meaning people will be keen for us to have a good time. As the evening unfolds, they might cheerfully come up to us and ask: Are you well? Are you having fun?\n\nThe intentions are moving, but the results can make us very sad. The vast majority of parties proceed with the view that what helps people to relax and feel content are displays of happiness, especially exuberant happiness. It is seeing another\u2019s good mood, hearing their stories of success and their joyful description of forward momentum, that will help us to tap into our own sources of delight and confidence.\n\nIt sounds logical, except that the truth of our psychology is stranger. What really breaks us out of our isolation is not to see others cheering, but to witness that the troubles that beset us \u2013 the shame, guilt, regret, despair, irritation and self-disgust \u2013 are not merely personal curses, as we had suspected in the echo chambers of our fearful minds, but have counterparts in our fellow humans. It is the sorrows of others that confirm us in our gloom and help to raise our spirits.\n\nWith a new psychology of companionship in mind, we can start to imagine what a properly sociable party might look like. There might not be any loud, upbeat music, perhaps just a sorrowful Bach cello concerto or a Requiem Mass somewhere in the background. The host would invite us to share everything about our lives that was less than perfect and that society had censored in the world beyond. We would have the chance to reveal how dark some of our thoughts were, and the extent of our anxiety. Heading home after such an evening, we would be sincerely happy because we had finally been able to offload, and to hear from others, how much of life is about sadness.\n\nIt is easy to feel that one must be a misanthrope for not wanting to attend parties, but the opposite may in reality be true. We hate most parties because we are unusually keen for human connection, which we simply can\u2019t find at the level of depth we crave at the average gathering. We want to be alone not because we genuinely don\u2019t like company but because we like the real thing so much, and because the simulacrum of company on offer reminds us too powerfully of an isolation that breaks our hearts.\n\nWe are generally left standing at parties, surrounded by forty people, feeling more isolated than on the surface of Mercury, because the forty party-goers, who could have offered each other so much, are collectively trapped in an ideology of false jubilance. In a better future, we would learn how to throw those paradoxical-sounding occasions, melancholy parties. There would be no more jolliness on display. There would only be some unusually vulnerable and candid people sitting around, confessing how hard they found it to be human. That would be something to properly celebrate.",

      "content": "## Splitting & Melancholy\n\nIt is a characteristic temptation of the mind to declare things to be either very, very good or very, very bad. Nuance is not our species\u2019 strong point or natural resting place.\n\nIt was the singular achievement of the mid-20th-century child psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to trace this problem back to early childhood. For Klein, infants and small children are inveterate dividers of the world into opposing camps of the brilliant and the awful, and they act in this way from the moment they emerge and have their first feed at the breast. Klein proposed that a newborn has no clear idea, at the very start, that its mother is even a whole person. She is just, at the outset, a pair of breasts from which stems the source of all life and goodness. Sometimes, when a feed is going well, when the milk is flowing strongly and nourishingly, the breast is a source of delight and perfection, it is impeccable and superb, it is scrupulously good. But at other points, when it\u2019s hard to latch on to the nipple, when the milk is resistant, the frustration is intolerable. The baby deems the breast defective, vengeful, useless and definitively bad. And so, in a mental process that Klein famously termed \u2018splitting\u2019, the infant ends up dividing the mother into nothing less than a good and a bad breast.\n\nEventually the child develops a capacity for more integrated and complex thoughts. It makes an astonishing realisation: that the breasts actually belong to a full person. And more importantly, that this person happens to be (strangely) both good and bad, both helpful and frustrating, both gratifying and maddening. Furthermore, a lot of people seem to have this dual nature; they can be fun and interesting at one moment, then really very irritating at another. Far from reflecting some rare deficiency, this duality is part of every human being. The child begins to accept that they, too, are a mixture of the good and the bad, but that this is no reason to hate or give up on themselves. Life can be lived in shades of grey.\n\nKlein was under no illusion about how easy these realisations might be to reach. She suggested that surrendering a black-and-white view is so hard for children that doing so will throw them into a period of melancholy thoughtfulness and contemplation that she called \u2018depressive realism\u2019. In this mournful state, they will shed some of their uninhibited early liveliness. They begin to recognise that the world has nothing entirely pure to offer them \u2013 but then again, to compensate, that there are far fewer utterly horrible things as well. Mummy is very nice but also deeply annoying; Daddy is funny but sometimes infuriating. Nursery isn\u2019t constantly great, but it isn\u2019t hell either.\n\nIn the course of her therapeutic work, Klein realised that not every adult has managed to go through the stage of \u2018depressive realism\u2019. A huge number of us are still stuck somewhere deep in the \u2018splitting\u2019 phase. That is, we continuously imagine that people and situations are completely pure and wonderful or appalling and detestable. Someone who doesn\u2019t agree with us politically is, for example, immediately a thorough villain: corrupt, hateful and deserving of total infamy. An ex-partner who has frustrated us must be a monster guilty of heinous behaviour and the worst motives. Someone who casts doubt on an idea of ours at the office is evidently entirely nefarious. The person we met on a dating site two and a half days ago is wholly beautiful and sensational to the core.\n\nKlein\u2019s insight was to associate maturity with a rejection of all such divisive \u2018split\u2019 positions. To be a proper grown-up is to realise that there are no paragons or monsters, no deities or total reprobates. There are only people somewhere in the middle, trying to act well, making mistakes, striving to say sorry, hoping to do better \u2013 and always full of regrets and embarrassments.\n\nLittle babies are very sweet, but splitting is anything but. It can power some of the most noxious forms of vengefulness, intolerance and political oppression. There is an angry splitting toddler inside the general who orders the persecution of their enemies and inside the revolutionary who coldly has their victims eliminated. One of our greatest of all achievements is a melancholy and essential realisation: that everyone, not least ourselves, is a mixture of devil and angel and that, therefore, tolerance and forbearance are truly non-negotiable features of a bearable outlook.",

He is worried about failure. He is contemplating a future in which he will be a social pariah, when mention of his name will be enough to provoke revulsion. He will be in agony, pondering his stupidity and bad luck. He will lament that he can\u2019t practise the job he most enjoys, and he will look around and feel desperation and envy at all those who remain so much more successful than he is and who still enjoy esteem and their good name.\n\nIt is, of course, a paradox that the most acclaimed writer in English literature should have worried so acutely about failure, and that he should have been so like us in fearing that he would one day \u2013 through a mixture of his own idiocy and unfortunate outside events \u2013 be a disgraced nobody. Then again, \u2018greatness\u2019 in literature doesn\u2019t come from living pompously among high-flown abstractions; great writers are ultimately simply those who know how to speak with special honesty about the panic and sadness of an ordinary life.\n\nWhat had brought Shakespeare to this anxious, vigilant state? Why was he so afraid he was going to lose it all? Partly because he was not yet very well established. He\u2019d only written Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI. In the coming years, he would write \u2013 in quick succession \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It and Twelfth Night. As yet, these would have been, at best, mere sketches in his mind. There was another problem. Shakespeare had a famous and very vicious enemy who was spreading rumours about him and seemed determined to bring him down. He was a fellow playwright called Robert Greene.\n\nGreene loathed Shakespeare. He wrote an open letter warning that \u2018There is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers heart wrapt in a Players hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you.\u2019 He nicknamed him \u2018Shakescene\u2019, that is, a show-off and a popularising fool, and, to further rub in how untalented he was, a jack of all trades or \u2018Johannes Factotum\u2019. In different circumstances, and with equal unfairness, we all have Robert Greenes around us. The world abounds in them, and they make life a good deal more terrifying and nastier than it should be.\n\nThe London theatre world was small, mean and very gossipy. This kind of review from a respected playwright was intended to damage and it would have done huge harm. One can imagine Shakespeare, still young and finding his feet in the capital, panicking at how bad the sniping was getting, worrying that such insults would never stop, knowing how many people had had a mean laugh at his expense, fearful that his good intentions would never surface and that he would forever be known as a cheap, unscrupulous idiot.\n\nFurthermore, there was a bad plague in progress. The bubonic plague returned continually to England in the Elizabethan age. The year before Shakespeare\u2019s birth, an outbreak had killed 80,000. And now it was back. Between August 1592 and January 1593, 20,000 people died in the south-east of England, 15,000 of them in London. There was rioting in the streets and Queen Elizabeth moved out to Windsor Castle for safety. The government shut down all pubs and theatres for six months. Every actor and playwright was out of work. Not only was his name being trashed, but Shakespeare was also facing financial ruin.\n\nHow to bear the terror of failure? With Shakespeare as our guide, though the impulse may be to turn away from fear, what can calm us down is to sit with what scares us most. We should dare to investigate the terrifying scenario so as to drain it of its strangeness, and stop apprehending it only through the corners of our eyes in shame. Shakespeare openly meditates on what might happen: he pictures the worst that could unfold in order to see how it might be borne. He also renders himself cathartically vulnerable in the process; he makes no bones about his suffering, to us in the future and \u2013 one imagines \u2013 to the people more immediately around him. He is going to admit just how bad things are for him in order to break his isolation and sense of unacceptability. He will try to universalise what could otherwise feel like only a very personal and embarrassing affliction. He will dare to see if anyone else has ever suffered as he has, and hold out an imaginary hand of friendship to all his readers, as writers will.\n\nThen comes the core of the consoling move. He recognises implicitly that what is driving his wish to be successful is the desire to be respected and liked. It is money and fame he is drawn to, but beneath these, there is another hunger: to be treated well and avoid humiliation. There is a quest for love hiding within the drive to be somebody. Once that idea is established, a deeply redemptive manoeuvre comes into view. We don\u2019t actually ever need the whole of society to love us. We don\u2019t have to have everyone on our side. Let the Robert Greenes of this world \u2013 and their many successors in newspapers, living rooms and social media down the ages \u2013 say their very worst and nastiest things and be done with them. All that one needs is the love of a few friends or even just one special person, and one can survive.\n\nThe love of a single sensitive and intelligent being can compensate us for the loss of love from the world. One can, as Shakespeare says, with such a gift, be in a better place than \u2018kings\u2019. Popular success is an unreliable goal at the mercy of fickle fortune: there are so many jealous people and we are prone to make mistakes that they can use to bring us down. We must, therefore, try to find, and look forward to leaning on, the affection and regard of sympathetic companions. Others may be scoffing, or sneer every time our name comes up in conversation, but we will be secure; we will be somewhere far from the gossipy and plague-ridden city, living quietly with those who properly know us and for whom we won\u2019t need to do anything to deserve a place in their hearts.\n\nShakespeare\u2019s sonnet 29 has been prized for four centuries because it latches on with such sincerity to an anxiety that afflicts us all, and proposes a solution that we know must be correct. In the end, things may turn out all right: the plague might recede, business may pick up, the rumour mill may die down and leave us alone. Even if none of this happens, if it does all go wrong and we become a definitive byword for awfulness, then in our moments of high anxiety, especially late at night, we should know the fallback: a few generous, sincere, emotionally mature souls who know about forgiveness and kindness, sympathy and charity, who won\u2019t reduce us to one horrid nickname, who will love us with the complex regard that a parent might bestow on a child or a god on its creations. Love will redeem us. We may well fail, but we don\u2019t need to fear it will be hell \u2013 and so we can afford to approach challenges with a little more freedom and light-heartedness. The cleverest and most humane writer who ever lived knew as much and, in our panic, we should trust him.",

      "content": "## Architecture & Melancholy\n\nA strange and rarely remarked upon feature of buildings is that they talk. They don\u2019t necessarily speak very loudly \u2013 sometimes it can just be a whisper \u2013 but if you go up to them and look at them properly, you can definitely hear them chatting.\n\nHere\u2019s the Mauritshuis, a museum in the Hague completed in the classical style in the early 19th century:\n\nI\u2019m dignified and stately. I place great emphasis on manners. I aspire to be calm and rational, but I hope not to be cold. I like to leave space for sweetness and tenderness. How are you feeling?\n\nSometimes a building likes to chat about its view of the world more broadly. This is more from the Mauritshuis:\n\nIt\u2019s good to remember your ancestors because that helps to root you in time. We\u2019re just one tiny moment in an incredibly long story. So many challenges have been overcome. Keeping history in mind acts as a buffer against the agitation of the present. I\u2019ve got some Ancient Greek and Roman relatives.\n\nLet\u2019s listen to another, very different building, the Villa Savoye, built in a suburb of Paris by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier in 1931:\n\nI\u2019m from the future. I\u2019ve had enough of tradition and the boring status quo. Recently, I journeyed in from another galaxy and settled down neatly in a pristine field. Stay with me and together we\u2019ll invent a new, better way of life.\n\nOf course, not every building talks to us in an especially pleasant voice. Some of them can be shouty or impatient. They can be a bit like those people we meet who don\u2019t look us in the eye, don\u2019t register our mood and don\u2019t ask us anything about ourselves. In a suburb of Madrid, there\u2019s a large residential block put up by a team of Dutch architects that speaks very dramatically.\n\nHi kids, I\u2019m not necessarily your age any more, but I\u2019m certainly up for some fun! Do you like my new trainers? I\u2019m so bored with convention. Let\u2019s shake it up a bit, out with the old, in with the wild! Dancing anyone?\n\nThe problem with buildings is that they have a great influence over our self-conception. Very often, we don\u2019t have a settled sense either of our value or of the stability and goodness of society. On a good day, things can feel tolerable; we have a measure of confidence in ourselves and faith in our fellow humans. But on others, we sense our mood dropping. We are anxious and guilty, and we don\u2019t feel very well disposed towards who we are; we wonder whether other people aren\u2019t simply cruel and out to get us.\n\nCrucially for our state of mind, it\u2019s architecture that can help to push us either in a positive or a negative direction. It\u2019s what buildings happen to be speaking about that holds one of the great keys to our mental stability. In a street that speaks of forgiveness, gentleness and modesty, the world can feel benevolent; we can be at ease and ready to be kind to ourselves. If we\u2019re stuck for too long in other environments, the external world starts to amplify the worst lines of our inner world. There are streets that talk to us sharply about shame, about being a nobody, about our life being valueless, about only money and success counting: these are some of the forbidding messages that can be articulated by doors and windows, building volumes and cladding materials.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t matter, but it tends to. Few of us are so impermeable to the voices of the streets that we don\u2019t get lastingly affected. That\u2019s why we ache for certain districts that can respect and like us \u2013 and are so scared of the remorseless negativity of others.\n\nThose of us who are of a melancholic cast of mind should take special care with the buildings we spend time around. Their voices are likely to affect us particularly deeply. We are especially in need of messages that are going to support the more robust sides of our characters and keep our vulnerabilities at bay.\n\nMost people, if they\u2019re ever in a position to commission a building, will tell architects about the number of rooms they need and the layouts they like. But if a key function of any work of architecture is to speak warmly to its vulnerable inhabitants, then in order to commission a house for a melancholic, one might ask an architect to work on a building that, when finished, would be able say some of the following:\n\nI know life\u2019s often sad and difficult. I\u2019ve been through a lot myself; I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. I\u2019m not in flawless shape, but you can be bashed around and get through it and still retain your integrity. You don\u2019t need to be perfect to deserve to exist. You can be good enough. I\u2019m cosy and strong. You\u2019ve suffered a lot. I\u2019m on your side.",

      "content": "## Adolescence & Melancholy\n\nIf there is any period of life in which a melancholic mood may be justified, then it is roughly between the ages of thirteen and twenty.\n\nIt is hard to imagine anyone going on to have a successful, or even somewhat contented, next six decades if they have not been the beneficiary of a good deal of agonising, sad introspection and intense dislocation in this period.\n\nAt the root of adolescent sorrow and rage is the recognition that life is hugely harder, more absurd and less fulfilling than we could ever hitherto have suspected \u2013 or had been led to suppose by kindly representatives of the adult world. The sentimental protection of childhood falls away and a range of searingly malevolent, but profoundly important, realisations strike.\n\nFor a start, we recognise that no one understands.\n\nThat isn\u2019t quite true, but, of course, the more complicated any human being is, the less likely they are to be easily and immediately understood. Therefore, as a child develops into an adult, the chances of those around them exactly sympathising with and swiftly grasping their inner condition necessarily decreases sharply.\n\nThe first response of the teenager is to think themselves uniquely cursed. The better eventual insight is that true connection with another person is possible, yet astonishingly rare. This leads the individual to a number of important moves. Firstly, to a heightened and more appropriate gratitude towards anyone who does understand. Secondly, to greater efforts to make themselves understood. The sullen grunts of early adolescence can give way to the enormous eloquence of the poetry, diaries and songs of later teenagehood. The most beautiful pieces of communication humanity has ever produced have largely been the work of people who couldn\u2019t find anyone in the vicinity they could talk to.\n\nAnd, lastly, the sense that one is different from other people, though it may be searingly problematic at the time, represents a critical moment when a new generation starts to probe at and selectively improve upon the existing order. To be sixteen and find everything perfect as it is would be a terrifyingly sterile conclusion. A refusal to accept the folly, error and evil of the world is a precondition of later achievement. There really seems no alternative but to be miserable in mid-adolescence if we are to stand any chance of making a go of the rest of our lives.\n\nAnother key realisation of adolescence is that we hate our parents.\n\nYet it is truly an enormous tribute to the love and care of parents if their teenage children turn around and tell them at the top of their voices that they loathe them. It isn\u2019t a sign that something has gone wrong; it\u2019s evidence that the child knows they are loved. The really worrying teenagers aren\u2019t those who misbehave around their parents and take out their random misery upon them. It\u2019s those who are so worried about not being loved that they can\u2019t afford to put a foot wrong.\n\nTo develop proper trust in other human beings, it can be deeply important to be able to test a few examples, to tell them the very worst things we can think of, and then watch them stick around and forgive us. We have to have a few goes at breaking love to believe it can be solid.\n\nAnd, of course, everyone\u2019s parents really are rather annoying in many ways, but that too is an important realisation. We would never leave home and become parents ourselves if we weren\u2019t, at some level, compensating for the problems, mistakes and vices we had first identified in our own parents at fourteen and a half.\n\nAnother source of teenage sorrow is how many big questions suddenly fill one\u2019s mind, not least: what is the point of it all? This questioning, too, is vital. The sorts of questions that adolescents raise tend to get a bad name, but that is more to do with how they answer them than with the questions themselves. What is the meaning of life? Why is there suffering? Why does capitalism not reward people more fairly? Adolescents are natural philosophers. The true endpoint of adolescence is not, as it\u2019s sometimes suggested, that we stop asking huge questions and get on with the day to day. It\u2019s that we acquire the resources and intelligence to build an entire life around the sort of big questions that first obsessed us at seventeen.\n\nLastly, and most poignantly, teenagers tend to hate themselves. They hate the way they look, how they speak, the way they come across. It feels like the opposite of being loved, but in fact, these isolated, self-hating moments are the start of love. These feelings are what will, one day, be at the bedrock of the ecstasy we\u2019ll feel in the presence of that rare partner who can accept and desire us back. Tenderness will mean nothing to us unless we first spent many nights alone crying ourselves to sleep.\n\nNature appears to have so arranged things that we really can\u2019t get to certain insights without suffering. The real distinction is between suffering with a purpose and suffering in vain. For all the horrors of adolescence, one of its glories is that the suffering it inflicts is largely securely rooted in some of the most crucial developments and realisations of adulthood. These fascinatingly miserable few years should be celebrated for offering us melancholy at its best.",

      "content": "## Fifty & Melancholy\n\nFifty is plainly and soberly the age of melancholy. Until then, rumours of decline could be warded off. In certain circumstances, we could even have been able to pass as youthful. With carefully chosen clothes and an up-to-date knowledge of music, we might not have stood out in a group of thirty-five-year-olds. If we had hazarded a self-regarding joke about advancing decrepitude, we might have been told to stop exaggerating and \u2013 as had been the intention all along \u2013 received reassurance and comfort. Now, the mention of our age prompts a visible wince from anyone more than five years below it. Fifty is no longer a jest or a cute dramatisation: this is the start of our old age.\n\nAn intimate knowledge of how fast it has gone since forty adds to the panic. A few more decades and there will be colostomy bags and wheelchairs. We may feel young inside, but our hands insist otherwise: they are the hands of old people. What we call a horrible picture of ourselves today will be one we will feel proud of in three years\u2019 time. \u2018Horrible pictures\u2019 are just a form of time travel; they are me-from-the-future sneaking in a visit.\n\nBy now, others will have started to die. Not the odd tragic one, as in our twenties, but constant cases. We start to scan obituaries.\n\nInevitably, there is a sexual component to our melancholy. We retreat in shame, knowing how sickening we must appear to so many. The thought of us as a sexual being fills most people with embarrassment. It feels like being desired by an elderly relative. It seems wholly against nature. We become, as a result of shame, highly formal, even distant. Younger people may think us unfriendly and verging on cold; we just want to be sure they know we haven\u2019t noticed them. They might declare us \u2018lovely\u2019 or \u2018sweet\u2019, the way one refers to a harmless pet.\n\nWe have, by this stage, accumulated a density of experience. Late at night, falling asleep, random images may come to mind \u2013 unbidden \u2013 of different sections of our lives: the desks at primary school, the first room at university, that little hotel in Paris, the trip to Los Angeles, the night in the Chinese restaurant, the light at dawn on the coast shortly after the birth. We have lived through so much that we may feel, at times, a thousand years old.\n\nLuckily, by fifty, we are more capable of gratitude. We know for sure that it won\u2019t go on forever, and so we\u2019re prepared not to scoff at much that we might previously have ignored on the way to greater things. We\u2019ve been through a sufficient number of panics and dramas to appreciate a quiet day. We\u2019ve met enough people, and fear their complexity sufficiently, to be content on our own. Simultaneously, we are a bit less interested in ourselves. We know how much about us will never change and how much we have messed up. In compensation, odd periods of history start to fascinate us \u2013 other countries too. We wash away our egoism in a broader stream. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter quite so much what happens to our name and reputation. Success is a chimera; all it buys is momentary admiration, when what counts is connection and closeness, times when the usual bravery can be sloughed off, and we can admit how difficult it all is and how sad we are. Enough grandstanding and pretence; the only people who still interest us are the kind ones, who have suffered and know how to use their pain to connect with others.\n\nWe may grow increasingly moved by young children. Our own bigger offspring are brooding somewhere upstairs; they despise us now. But in the park, when we see a little one advancing happily towards its mother, in that drunken teetering way they have, we know exactly what it would feel like to pick them up; we remember their weight \u2013 that peculiar lightness that the human race has for a while \u2013 and long for the simplicity of this phase, when there wasn\u2019t quite so much resentment and we could be a hero for suggesting some dancing or an ice cream.\n\nAt fifty, we are at the top of the long slide down to death. For a few more years, we can stand upright, but soon enough our backs will stiffen, our knees will give way (they let out odd noises already) and it will be hard to put on socks. Still, we can\u2019t complain of an injustice or report the matter to the authorities. This is what happens to all of us. It\u2019s in the contract we signed at birth; it\u2019s not an outrage or a mistake, though that is exactly what it feels like.\n\nThe only way out is to wear our despair lightly, to turn it into a dark joke. It\u2019s too late to make big changes, but we can learn to carry our mediocrity with as much dignity as possible, to rediscover modesty and exit a range of situations we should no longer be in. We should settle into the mood most suited to our age; we should learn to live under the sign of Saturn, in a spirit of benign, ego-less melancholy.",

      "content": "## Luxury & Melancholy\n\nThere is an age, and a frame of mind, when we are strong enough to treat luxury with every bit of the disdain it deserves; when we know how to pour rightful scorn on its cost, its futility and most of all its vanity. When we are young and hopeful, we know that there is no need for an overpriced hotel when a hostel can just as well house our dreams. We understand the folly of those overblown seats at the front of the aircraft, whose occupants will touch down not a minute earlier. We have a future rich enough not to confuse paid-for kindness with love.\n\nThen there comes an age, more sombre and melancholy in nature, when \u2013 if we have any possibility \u2013 we may find our Spartan honesty vibrate and start to crumble. We may invest in the roomier, more plushly carpeted section of the aircraft we\u2019d once dismissed, and discover a happiness deeper than we had ever thought possible. In a plane, high above the Earth, we are looked after by a new friend who has troubled to learn our name and has hung our jacket in a closet with a wooden hanger! As we cross the Tropic of Cancer, and as down below in Madhya Pradesh, villages flicker by the light of paraffin lamps, we receive a tray on which an infinitely thoughtful and fascinating-sounding chef has laid out a small bread roll, a lobster tail salad,\n\na filet mignon and what might be the sweetest hazelnut and chocolate cake we have ever tasted \u2013 and we may feel the onset of what could be tears at the beauty and kindness that surround us. It is, in its way, like being a child again, ministered to by a devoted parent during an especially vicious fever. Now that parent is dead, and we are far from being that little cute creature in elephant pyjamas that no one could hate and who had never done anything seriously wrong.\n\nOr we may find ourselves in a foreign city and be unable to resist the call of an idiotically costly grand Belle Epoque hotel on the main square. After an hour of reading in our oversized tub, we may order room service and, soon after, receive a visit from another new friend, pushing a trolley that he steers to the foot of our immaculately turned down king-sized bed. The meal itself might not be anything wondrous, considered objectively \u2013 chicken schnitzel or a salmon tagliatelle \u2013 but what it symbolises is immense. They, our new family in the hotel, have kept things warm for us in a special heated recess under the table or covered it with a silver dome. Someone, an angel, has wondered if we might like flowers, and has inserted a tulip into a narrow glass vase, so as to cheer us as we eat. Someone else, a ministering deity, has worried about bread and provided a small but fascinatingly diverse selection (one with walnuts, another with olives, a third with garlic). Now kindly George from room service interrupts our daydream. He would like to know if we would prefer still or sparkling water. And should he pour balsamic or white wine vinegar over the tomato salad?\n\nThis sort of thing can end up mattering a lot (too much) because, in other areas of our lives, so much has gone wrong, for reasons that are at once complex but definitive. Our child no longer looks up when we greet them at breakfast; our spouse is filled with resentments. We seem to have lost most of our friends through neglect. There is so much that those close to us seem to hate us for. We are increasingly convinced of the utter meaninglessness and banality of our existence.\n\nOh, but here, in the luxury cabin or bedroom, it isn\u2019t \u2013 for a few hours \u2013 like this at all. Here there is only kindness and indulgence. It\u2019s all artificial, of course, engineered by monstrous sums of money, and would come to an end immediately if the credit card were declined (we\u2019d be in prison within hours). Still, while the money flows, we can be in the presence of something astonishing and delightful: a portion of the kindness and consideration we crave, but hardly ever receive and know we don\u2019t deserve.\n\nMoney obviously cannot buy us what we truly want: the warm regard of those we live around. Yet it can, at points, at least buy us a few symbols of considerateness, and sometimes that might be the very best we can hope for, and that is realistically available to us, in our distinctly bathetic and radically imperfect lives. We may not always have the inner resources to find luxury the silly thing it actually is.",

      "content": "## Sunday Evening & Melancholy\n\nIt descends, normally, between around 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. and can be at its height at 6, especially when the weather is turning and the last of the daylight has burnished the sky a shade of crimson pink.\n\nThe Sunday evening melancholic feeling is ordinarily associated with work, and the prospect of going back to the office after a pleasant break. In truth, this doesn\u2019t quite cover the complexity of what is going on. It isn\u2019t just that we have some sort of work to do tomorrow that is dragging down our mood, but that we are going back to the wrong sort of work \u2013 even while we are in dire ignorance of what the right sort of work might actually be.\n\nWe all have inside us what we might term a true working self, a set of inclinations and capacities that long to exert themselves on the raw material of reality. We want to turn the vital bits of who we are into jobs and ensure that we can see ourselves reflected in the services and products we are involved in turning out. This is what we understand by the right job, and the need for one is as fundamental and as strong in us as the need to love. We can be as broken by a failure to find our professional destiny as we are by our inability to identify an intimate companion.\n\nFeeling that we are in the wrong job, and that our true vocation lies undiscovered, is not a minor species of discomfort; it may be the central crisis of our lives.\n\nWe normally manage to keep this crisis at bay during the week. We are too busy and too driven by an immediate need for money. But it can come to trouble us on Sunday evenings. Like a ghost suspended between two worlds, the crisis has not been allowed either to live or to die, and so bangs at the door of consciousness, requiring resolution. We are sad because a part of us recognises that time is running out and that we are not presently doing what we should with what remains of our lives. The anguish of Sunday evening is our conscience trying to stir us inarticulately into making more of ourselves before time runs out.\n\nSunday evenings have a history. Until recently, the last hundred years or so, there was \u2013 for most of us \u2013 no question of our true selves ever finding expression in our work. We worked to survive and would be grateful for a minimal income. Such reduced expectations no longer hold. We know \u2013 because there are enough visible examples of people who have done so \u2013 that we could harness our sincere talents to the engines of commerce. We know that we don\u2019t have to be unhappy in this area, which adds a feeling of particular shame if we still are.\n\nWe should not be so hard on ourselves. We don\u2019t yet have the mechanisms in place to match all jobs to meaningful destinies. We can be both sure that we are not doing what we should, and wholly at sea about where our genuine purpose might lie.\n\nThe answer is patience and steadfast self-examination. We need some of the discipline of the detective, or an archaeologist reassembling the pieces of a smashed jar. We should not dismiss our angst blithely as \u2018the Sunday blues\u2019, to be assuaged with a drink and a film. We should see it as belonging to a confused, yet utterly central, search for a real self that has been buried under a need to please others and take care of short-term needs for status and money.\n\nIn other words, we should not keep our Sunday evening feelings simply for Sunday evenings. We should place these feelings at the centre of our lives and let them be the catalysts for a sustained exploration that continues throughout the week, over months and probably years, and that generates conversations with ourselves, with friends, with mentors and with professionals. Something very serious is going on when sadness and anxiety descend for a few hours on Sunday evenings. We aren\u2019t simply a bit bothered because we have to end two days of leisure; we\u2019re being made to suffer by a reminder to try to discover who we really are and to do justice to our talents before it is too late.\n\nAgnes Martin,Morning, 1965",

      "content": "## Agnes Martin & Melancholy\n\nIf there were to be a patron artist of melancholy, it might be the American abstract painter Agnes Martin. Over a long life (1912\u20132004), she produced hundreds of canvases, most of them 1.8 by 1.8 metres, showing not very much at all. From a distance, they can seem merely white or grey, though step nearer and you notice grid patterns hand drawn in pencil, beneath which run horizontal bands of colour, often a particularly subtle shade of grey, green, blue or pink. There is an invitation to slough off the normal superficiality of life and bathe in the void of emptiness; the effect is soothing and moving too. For reasons to be explored, we might want to start crying.\n\nThe works may appear simple, but their effects are anything but. \u2018Simplicity is never simple,\u2019 explained Martin, having studied Zen Buddhism for many years and learnt that encounters with little can be frightening, because they remind us of our own ultimate nothingness, which we otherwise escape through noise and frantic and purposeless activity. \u2018Simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve, from the standpoint of the East. I\u2019m not sure the West even understands simplicity.\u2019\n\nIn the little town of Taos, in the north central region of New Mexico, where Martin spent her last years, one can visit the Agnes Martin Chapel, an octagonal room, empty except for seven of her paintings and four steel cubes by her friend and fellow minimalist artist Donald Judd. Here we can sense how far we generally drift from what is important, how often we lose ourselves in meaningless chatter. The paintings bid us to throw aside our customary, relentless self-promotion. It is just us and the sound of our own heartbeat, the light coming in from an oculus above (across which a New Mexico cloud occasionally drifts), the patient work of thousands of hand-drawn grids repetitively punctuated by strips of the mildest hues of grey and pink \u2013 and the peace there would have been over the oceans when the Earth was first created.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t suppose that Agnes Martin was herself anything like the peaceful canvases she turned out. When still a young woman, she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffered from repeated bouts of extreme depression. She would often hear voices in her head criticising her and urging her to take her own life. It could be hell inside her mind. But it is then all the more understandable that she might, as an artist, have felt compelled to produce some of the most serene works the world has ever known, and that she gained boundless relief from spending hours \u2013 decades in total \u2013 alone in a simple house on the edge of the New Mexico desert, listening to Bach and Beethoven, tracing grids on canvases and applying paint in colours that Zen Buddhism identifies with the renunciation of the ego and the alignment of the self with cosmic harmony.\n\nThe Agnes Martin Chapel, Taos,New Mexico\n\nIf we are moved, it\u2019s not because our lives are themselves extremely serene. It\u2019s because, like the artist herself, we have for far too long been familiar with excessive noise. The canvases are like maps to a quiet destination we have lost sight of. We might point to them and say that this is where we actually, really belong. The paintings are how we could be if we sat with our own feelings a little longer, if we gave up using our clever minds to ward off sadness, if we made our peace with mystery.\n\nNowadays, by the typically perverse accidents of the art market, Agnes Martin\u2019s paintings cost as much as aeroplanes. Generally, they can only be seen in bustling public museums. In a better world, we\u2019d all be able to have a few of our own. As it is, we can at least spend time with them in high-quality online versions and printed reproductions. They are sad pictures, in the best of ways. They know of our troubles; they understand how much we long for tenderness yet how rough everything has been day to day; they want us to have the simplicity of little children and the hearts of old, wise people who have stopped protesting and started to welcome experience. The titles that Martin gave her paintings indicate some of what she was getting at: Loving Love, Gratitude, Friendship and \u2013 best of all \u2013 I Love the Whole World, which implies the sort of love we experience not when everything has been hunky-dory, but when we have, after the longest time, come through from the other side of agony.\n\nAgnes Martin, I Love the WholeWorld, 1993",

      "content": "## Hokusai & Melancholy\n\nThere are two ways of looking at Mount Fuji. As a geological phenomenon, it is classified as a stratovolcano, 3,700 metres high, 10,000 years old, which last exploded in 1707. It stands on the island of Honsh\u016b\n\nline where the Amurian, Okhotsk and Philippine plates meet, with a mounting pressure inside its magma chamber of 1.6 megapascals and an average temperature at its summit of \u20135\u2070 Celsius.\n\nBut Mount Fuji is simultaneously a spiritual phenomenon, interpreted in both the Shinto and Zen Buddhist traditions as a conduit to, and guardian of, wisdom and enlightenment. There are temples and rituals in its honour. It is understood to have a meaning; it wants to tell us things. For Buddhism, humans are perpetually at risk of forgetting their true irrelevant position within the natural world. We overlook our powerlessness and unimportance in the universal order. This amnesia isn\u2019t a helpful illusion; it is responsible for much of our frustration, anger and vain self-assertion. We rage at events because we cannot see the necessities we are up against. So Buddhism regularly turns our attention to natural elements (rocks, rain showers, streams, giant cedar trees, the stars), because it sees these as helping us gracefully to come to terms with our subservience. We can be reminded that we have no alternative but to submit to nature\u2019s laws and that our freedom comes from adjusting our individual egos to what defies us. For Zen, Fuji is only the largest conveyor of a general truth, but it deserves special reverence because of the extraordinary elegance and simplicity with which it delivers its message. Its beauty, visible on a clear day when its cone is newly sprinkled with snow, makes it a little easier to accept that we will die, that nothing we achieve will matter and that we are as nothing next to the aeons of time to which the Earth has been witness.\n\nThe printmaker and artist Katsushika Hokusai was in his seventies and already famous across Japan when he hit on an idea that would immortalise his name. His project was to depict Fuji obliquely, in a series he called Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, published between 1830 and 1832.\n\nWe catch Fuji peeking out from behind a busy bridge over the Fuka river on its way out of Sumida; it\u2019s in the background as workers and travellers do business together in the Sundai district of Edo (Tokyo); it\u2019s there as some pilgrims have a picnic in the gardens of Kyoto\u2019s Ry\u014dan-ji temple, and as a peasant leads a horse laden with saddlebags full of grass in Senju; it\u2019s watching as a half-naked craftsman makes a barrel in Owari province, and as workers fix the roof of the Mitsui department store in Edo; it\u2019s discreetly in the frame as some clam fishermen fill their baskets in Noboto Bay, and a group of pleasure-seekers have refreshments at a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) on Goten Hill near Shinagawa.\n\nIn some of the prints, the contrast between the puny defencelessness of vainglorious humans and the indifference of mighty nature is at a pitch. We feel pity and melancholy for what we are up against. In the tenth view in the series (overleaf), we see a group of travellers wending their way around rice paddies on the eastern sea route near Ejiri in Suruga province. It\u2019s autumn and a gust of wind has just blown. That\u2019s all that is needed to break our fragile hold on order; Hokusai\u2019s humans are at once thrown into chaos. They struggle to keep hold of their hats, their possessions fly into the paddy fields and someone\u2019s papers (it might be anything from the manuscript of a novel to some tax returns \u2013 though what it really stands for is human logic and presumption) are being carried off into oblivion, and might end up in an adjoining province or a nearby muddy ditch. This, Hokusai is telling us, is what humanity is: easily buffeted, one gust away from disaster, defenceless before nature, trying to work out what it all means on bits of paper that are as evanescent as fireflies.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, Ejiri in Suruga Province (Sunsh\u016b Ejiri), 10th image from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, c. 1830\u20131832\n\nIn the eighth view, the sun is setting over Fuji; it will be dark in half an hour. A couple of hikers are ascending the steep Inume Pass while, a long way behind them, two traders are following with heavily laden horses. We can tell this latter pair are in trouble. Those horses won\u2019t make it up the pass in the darkness, and there\u2019s a strong risk someone will fall down a precipice. This may be the end of the road for the unfortunate traders. Even so, the wider mood is not mournful or panicked. Fuji is serene, as it always is, even when in its shadow, people are being buried, or dying of cancer, or imploring the heavens, or regretting their lives. Nature doesn\u2019t care one bit about us \u2013 which is both the origin of our damnation and, when we can accept the idea, a source of redemption.\n\n8th image from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, c. 1831\u20131832\n\nThen there is the most famous view of all, the first in the series (see overleaf). Three fishing boats are out at sea off the coast of Kanagawa. They are the fast oshiokuri-bune boats, each powered by eight muscular rowers with two relief crew members. These craft catch fresh fish (typically, tuna, sea bass or flounder) for the marketplaces and restaurants of Edo, but today nature has other plans. It doesn\u2019t care about this evening\u2019s makizushi or the lives of thirty little people with families and dependents and hopes of their own. It has decided to send a giant wave, twelve metres high, to toss things about and remind humanity of who is in charge. We shudder for the fishermen\u2019s fates. This doesn\u2019t look like a picture of survival; it seems a prelude to a wake. Fuji looks on impassively, its tiny-seeming snow-capped peak impersonating the foaming sea closer by. We are pawns in the hands of forces that care nothing for us, and that will not mourn us for a moment when we are gone.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura) or The Great Wave, 1st image from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, c. 1830\u20131832\n\nHokusai could have chosen to anchor his melancholy meditations on human powerlessness to any number of natural phenomena: for example Thirty-six Views of the Moon, Thirty-six Views of Drifting Clouds, Thirty-six Views of the Constellation Cassiopeia (a dim speck in the night sky, 4,000 light years away). Against these, too, his genius could have shown up our exploits in all their absurdity: a couple squabbling, a writer finishing a book, a person weeping at their medical diagnosis, a lover pining for companionship.\n\nWe have to live knowing that most of what we do is, in a cosmic sense, ridiculous. Our lives are no more profound than that of an earthworm, and almost as fragile. In so far as we can ever recover a little meaning, it is by ceasing to worry so much about ourselves and identifying instead with planetary reality \u2013 even to the point where we might contemplate our own mortality with a degree of equanimity; by fully and generously appreciating our absurdity, and using it as a springboard to kindness, art and melancholy.",

      "content": "## Travel & Melancholy\n\nFew moments in our lives are as melancholy as those in which we go travelling somewhere on our own. Imagine that it\u2019s late in the evening at a large airport somewhere in modernity. Most of the terminal is now empty; the few remaining departures are all for other continents. Most of us will be spending the night over an ocean turned silver by a brilliant moon. The waiting travellers are spread out across the terminal. Some are sleeping, most are checking messages, a few are looking pensively into the middle distance. Outside, maintenance crews are loading bags and fitting fuel hoses. Stacks of meals are being craned into galleys. Occasionally, a metallic voice reminds us to stay close to our luggage or announces that a plane is ready to board: Osaka, San Francisco, Beijing, Dubai. So many unforeseen, unknown places. The world is still, in its way, so large and unknown.\n\nThrough the plate glass windows, a roar of engines can be heard. Another giant ascends to the skies. Soon it will be our turn. Everyone here is a pilgrim, everyone seems lost \u2013 and this may offer us more of a sense of being understood than an environment that speaks in sentimental tones of settled community and family harmony. We are all misfit nomads here. No one belongs and therefore everyone can belong. We, who permanently feel like outsiders, may be nowhere more at home than in the lonely drift of a brightly lit airport at 11 p.m.\n\nThere can be a similar pleasing melancholy in a hotel room in a city where we know no one. For a whole evening, we may be on our own with the television, room service and a view onto 300 other similar windows across a courtyard. Our thoughts can feel newly expansive and free, released from the normal demands of home and its pressures to be coherent and predictable, knowable and tame. The unfamiliar furniture, the foreign soap operas on TV and the sounds of the city beyond release us to explore ideas we had resisted. From our bed, we can see a person in another room reading; above them, a couple appear to be arguing; in a third, a child is showing their teddy the view. We feel a rush of love for these people we will never meet, but with whom we are briefly sharing a slice of existence in a frightening anonymous concrete block on the edge of an ugly, wealthy city in a country we have no energy to understand. How much we might like to open up to them; how much secret sorrow and regret there will be; how worthy we all are of forgiveness and tenderness.\n\nIn anonymous places \u2013 airports, hotels, diners, train stations \u2013 we have an opportunity to meet disavowed sides of our characters: sadness, regret and loss. The bleakness all around is a relief from the false comforts of home. We don\u2019t have to pretend any longer. The environment supports us in our wish to own up to a sadness we may have hidden from for too long.\n\nThe fellow outsiders we encounter in these lonely places seem closer to offering us the true community we crave than the friends we should supposedly rely on.\n\nThere can be something almost beautiful about the ugliest kinds of travelling place: plasticised, brightly lit, garish, cheap. The lack of domesticity, the pitiless illumination and the anonymous furniture offer an alternative to the covert cruelty of ordinary good taste. It may be easier to give way to sadness here than in a cosy living room with wallpaper and framed photos.\n\nWe may feel most at home where there is no option to belong.",

      "content": "## Misanthropy & Melancholy\n\nIt\u2019s peculiar to think that a word like \u2018misanthropy\u2019 exists in our language: \u2018a dislike of humankind\u2019. For a phenomenon to become a word, it needs a sufficient number of people to identify with it; it has to be an idea that we recognise in ourselves and others and then want to name and, in some cases, wear with pride.\n\nThat we have such a stark and straightforward word in so many languages suggests that, whatever our apparent allegiance to our species, it isn\u2019t very uncommon for a human being to look at who we are collectively \u2013 what we get up to, how we behave, how our thoughts run \u2013 and in the end want to give up. At the sight of our limitless violence, wickedness and folly, we may wish that humanity had never evolved. We may feel that Homo sapiens has ultimately proved an unending and undignified plague upon the Earth, whose reign should end without regret.\n\nMisanthropy isn\u2019t bias or prejudice or snobbery. The misanthrope isn\u2019t singling out or prioritising any one group. They\u2019re treating everyone equally, even themselves. They\u2019ve just reached the unfashionable view that we are a disgrace; that we don\u2019t deserve life. It is a supreme movement of the imagination: to be human and yet to settle on the considered judgement that humans might be a cosmic error, a moral mistake.\n\nWhat thoughts underpin the misanthrope\u2019s convictions? What is so appalling about us? A true list would be very, very long. A beginning might look like this:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are ineradicably violent. We keep justifying our recourse to brutality through an appeal to a higher goal (we are fighting for a little while for the sake of the motherland, for justice, for our god). Yet so regularly and gleefully do we erupt into cruelty that something more basic seems to be at play: we are violent because we have an ingrained taste for blood; we destroy because without a chance of a rampage, we would be bored; because it\u2019s, in the end, a lot of fun to fight.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are unavailingly vindictive. Someone does us wrong, but rather than being spurred on to a little more tolerance and humanity, our wounds charge us up to smite others back with even greater force the moment we have the chance. An eye for an eye is for weaklings; we\u2019d rather just kill outright when it\u2019s our turn.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are immeasurably self-righteous. A part of our mind is constantly spinning a story about why it\u2019s right for us to do what we do, and erasing the slightest doubts as to actions or any possible need for self-examination or apology. It\u2019s always the others\u2019 fault; there\u2019s always a reason why we don\u2019t need to say sorry, and why we are victims rather than perpetrators. Placed end to end, our moments of guilt and atonement might amount to no more than half an hour across a lifetime. We are shameless.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are fatefully inaccurate in who we punish. We are hurting, but the person who hurt us isn\u2019t in the room, or we can\u2019t get to them, so we redirect our rage onto the closest available defenceless target. We kick the dog on a grand, planetary scale.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do eventually learn and improve. There\u2019s a higher chance of having good sense after some decades on the planet, but there are always newer, hungrier, more ferocious types coming on the scene, ready to refuel humanity\u2019s reserves of vehemence and savagery. We can\u2019t hold on to our insights; the wisdom painfully built up through wars, divorces and squabbles gets reliably erased every few years. We return to primal rage with every generation. Our knives get sharper and our weapons keener, but moral progress eludes us; the gap between our power and our acumen widens ineluctably. We\u2019re as dumb as we ever were.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re entirely uncurious as to why people we dislike made mistakes. We gain far too much pleasure from calling them evil. We adore never for a moment having to imagine that they too might simply be worried or sad or operating under compulsions they regret. We thrive on a sense of our rectitude.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are jealous of all the perceived advantages of others, but rather than admit to our feelings of inadequacy and impotence, we turn our sorrow into fervour. We attempt to destroy those who unwittingly humiliated us. We turn our feelings of smallness into sulphurous cruelty.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We loathe compromise. We only want purity. We can\u2019t accept that something might be \u2018good enough\u2019 or that progress might come slowly. We\u2019d rather burn the whole house down now than patiently fix a wall.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We find gratitude intolerably boring; we\u2019re sick of having to appreciate what we have. Grievance is so much more interesting.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can\u2019t laugh because we don\u2019t, despite everything, find ourselves ridiculous. We hire professional comedians, as though finding ourselves stupid were a possibility someone else had to explore for us.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re obsessed by justice, and we think so little of kindness. Justice means giving people what they are owed; kindness \u2013 a far more important quality \u2013 means giving someone something they\u2019re not owed, but desperately need anyway. It means knowing how to be merciful.\n\nMelancholic misanthropists love people, of course \u2013 or they did, once upon a time. What high hopes one has to have started with in order to end up feeling so sad at the state of our species. How much one would need to love humanity in order to conclude that we\u2019re a cosmic error. Melancholic misanthropists aren\u2019t mean; they\u2019re just casting around for a few solid reasons to keep faith with the human experiment. And, for the moment at least, they\u2019re struggling.",

      "content": "## Extinction & Melancholy\n\nOne day, if human civilisation ever wipes itself out, aliens or one of our successors will cast an eye on our ruined planet and ask themselves whatever happened to Homo sapiens. Their answer might look a little like this.\n\nThe root cause won\u2019t be the specific catastrophe, conflict or devastation that eradicates us; the problem will begin with the architecture of the human brain.\n\nThis tool will be remembered for being, in part, deeply impressive, containing 100 billion neurons capable of extraordinary computations and combinations. As aliens will note, a particular part of the mind where our most dazzling thoughts unfolded was known to neuroscientists as the neocortex \u2013 a part that was many times larger in humans than in any other species. This is what helped this hugely clever ape to produce The Magic Flute, Anna Karenina, Concorde and civilisations.\n\nHowever, our alien friends will also note that the human mind contained another component, very influential but far less impressive, known as the reptilian brain. This is an aggressive, lustful, impulsive section of machinery, with a great deal more in common with what might be found in a hyena or a small rodent.\n\nBecause of this reptilian brain, Homo sapiens ended up with three grave problems:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tribalism. Humans were always on the verge of developing violent hatreds of foreigners and manifested strong ongoing tendencies to slaughter strangers in vast numbers. They could never reliably see the humanity in all members of their own kind.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Homo sapiens was fatefully prone to short-term thinking. Even when confronted by data, the species could only imagine the near-term future, a few years at best, viewing the long-term as a chimerical and unreal state. Humans\u2019 immediate impulses were left uncontained and worked to destroy their individual and collective future.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Homo sapiens had an especially keen fondness for wishful thinking. Though capable of immense intellectual achievement, the human mind hated to reflect on itself; it couldn\u2019t bear to submit its ideas to rational scrutiny, and preferred to act rather than think, and daydream rather than plan. Having invented the scientific method, it preferred \u2013 in most cases \u2013 not to use it. It had a narcotic desire for distraction and fantasy. It didn\u2019t want to know itself.\n\nFor many generations, these three flaws were more or less endured. Certain institutions were invented to attenuate them: the law, sound government, education, philosophy, science. It worked, sort of. Humans kept wiping out swathes of their fellows, but they didn\u2019t scupper the species as a whole. What caused the ultimate destruction was the increasing, yet untrammelled, power of the neocortex. This mighty tool eventually managed to capture fire, contain the elements and give Homo sapiens a godlike power over the planet \u2013 while the animal overall still operated with reflexes akin to those of a hyena. The cost of the species\u2019 mistakes grew ever larger, and its powers became uncontained while its wisdom remained intermittent and fragile. Eventually, its might outpaced its capacity for self-control; it became a nuclear-armed rodent.\n\nThere was one thing that might have saved humanity: love. Three varieties of it in particular:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Love of the stranger: the capacity to see the other as like ourselves and worthy of the same mercy and charity.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Love of the unborn: the concern for those who do not yet exist and whom we will never know, but whose lives we are shaping in the selfish present.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Love of the truth: the strength to resist illusion and lies and square up to uncomfortable facts of all kinds.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to be aliens of the future to understand all this. We can see the disaster scenario only too well right now. The fate of civilisation lies ultimately not in the law courts, at the ballot box or in the corridors of governments. It lies in our ability to master the most short-term, selfish and violent of our impulses active in the dense folds of organic matter between our ears; it lies in learning how to try relentlessly to compensate for the flawed architecture of our minds.",

Misery is the norm; one is born to suffer; the rewards may come, if at all, in another life. To suggest that happiness might be a right and to inscribe this ambition explicitly in one\u2019s founding document is one part, and perhaps the most significant, of what has from the outset rendered the United States an exception among nations.\n\nNo visitor will fail to note the expressions of this constitutional hedonism. The greetings are effusive, the smiles acute. Gigantic billboards express the national catechism along the highways, and the radio voices are frenziedly jubilant. Everyone is on an upwards path. Jerusalem is not a mythic city in the next world; it is to be built right here, with these hands, on this hill.\n\nArtists of the American republic have never found it hard to create an ironic effect simply by placing, and exploring, the lives of real people against the backdrop of this self-proclaimed earthly Jerusalem. Here is a \u2018regular\u2019 upstanding family man at Disneyland\u2019s Enchanted Castle, texting his lover and plotting his escape. Here is a fractious couple moving towards divorce at the Paradise Resort in Malibu. Here is the ostracised prom queen, weeping by her stretch limousine. And here is an enthusiastic RV salesman, who will in a few hours shoot himself with a .45 in the parking lot of the Sunshine Motel. In far more accomplished ways, in half a dozen art forms, we\u2019ve been here many, many times before.\n\nWhat is being mocked is how hard the surrounding culture has made it for people to reconcile themselves to their own reality. Self-acceptance can feel impossible when perfection is meant to be the norm. What chances does one have to cry without shame in Happy, Texas (\u2018the town without a frown\u2019)? Grief is left to be viewed as a damning personal deficiency rather than what it might otherwise and more consolingly be known as: an inevitable outcome of existence in a disenchanted, venal world.\n\nThe American misery that does exist is quickly medicalised and, if possible, expunged chemically. Or else, when someone can be blamed for it, there may be a lawsuit. What is intolerable is that sorrow should be interpreted as a general rule, which might not be immediately cured or neatly pinned to a personal failing. America is a very difficult place in which to admit to melancholy. The feeling isn\u2019t merely evidence of an individual loss of spirit; it\u2019s an affront to national destiny.\n\nPsychology teaches us that manic happiness is frequently a symptom of a pain that cannot be faced. A smile has to become permanent in order that an underlying sorrow can never be felt. By extension, America may be smiling very hard not because it is genuinely carefree, but because there are a few things it simply cannot bear to mourn.\n\nThe impossible promise of eternal, unbroken happiness.Coca-Cola billboard, Los Angeles, USA, c. 1980\n\n\u2018Welcome to Happy, The Town Without A Frown\u2019, Texas, USA\n\nIt is telling that there are two groups within the United States who have never found it hard to own up to sadness. At the centre of Native American history is the Trail of Tears, a memory of the forcible mass removal of the Cherokees \u2013 against the explicit promises of earlier leaders in Washington \u2013 from their lands east of the Mississippi to what is now Oklahoma. There are, unsurprisingly, few happy faces staring back at us from 19th-century Native American portraits. In many communities, Thanksgiving is plainly known as the National Day of Mourning.\n\nAfrican Americans have passed through a comparably bleak experience of the republic. Not for nothing has one of their major cultural contributions to the history of music been known, quite simply, as the \u2018blues\u2019. No wonder the smiles in the dominant culture have often had to be so bright to cover up so many tears.\n\nAll countries have their horrors and all peoples their sources of guilt. There can be no purity and no unalloyed pride. The more a nation is able to accept how much it has, across its history, been involved in pain, the more it can come to a natural and mature relationship to darkness. It won\u2019t need to smile so perfectly and so avidly, like someone who is in flight from something they cannot mourn; it can learn more easily to walk, and take ownership of, its own trail of tears.\n\nElizabeth \u2018Betsy\u2019 Brown Stephens, 1903, a Cherokee Indian who walked the Trail of Tears in 1838\n\nThe Trail of Tears memorial monument, New Echota, Georgia, which honours the 4,000 Cherokees who died on the Trail of Tears",

We\u2019re a mere 7.5 billion, while there are 19 billion chickens, 1 billion sheep, 1 billion pigs and 1.5 billion cows.\n\nThey certainly cannot be happy, yet they can never complain. They are structurally among the most melancholic living things on the planet. To understand the essence of sadness, we don\u2019t need to read poetry by a tubercular 19th-century poet or the analyses of a mid-20th-century existential philosopher. We need only spend a few minutes gazing into the eyes of a Black Angus cow, who has had two summers on the Earth and is now a few days away from slaughter.\n\nIt would be stretching credulity to say that they could understand exactly what was coming for them. We can hazard that they might feel that something was awry; that the system into which they were born was too systematised and structured to be wholly honest; that there was something suspicious in those calorie-rich meals they were constantly being fed, with scarcely time to pause and ruminate; that there was a worrying brutality in the manner of the men herding them from steel enclosure to steel enclosure or jabbing them with vitamins and hormones; that those repeated disappearances and the bellowing near the trucks might one day catch up with them.\n\nIt is often said that we wouldn\u2019t eat meat if we could see inside an abattoir. But our consciences might be stirred far earlier and less dramatically, simply if we spent two minutes forcing ourselves to look into the eyes of a condemned cow at the edge of a field. What is most humbling is their passivity and readiness to be kind. One might fear that they would come to their senses and attack. We would deserve it if they kicked us to death. Instead, if we place a little grass on our palm, they will pull what passes for a smile and let their large fleshy tongue whip the snack up into their mouths. They let us stroke their noses and caress their flanks \u2013 which will soon be hanging from a fast-moving hook in a refrigerated chamber covered in discarded hooves, tails, faeces expelled in a panic and splatterings of brown-red blood.\n\nIt\u2019s as though they know, as they stare back at us. They know our cheap desires, our cover-ups, our paltry excuses, our absurd claims to enlightenment and goodness, how we have done nothing but hoodwink them since it all began in central Anatolia 10,000 years ago. At least at the start, their lives were expensive and precious enough to be revered; some self-righteous human might have written a poem or organised a festival the day they were slaughtered. It was ridiculous, but better than being hung upside down and shot coldly in the head along with another fifty of the herd you grew up with, and then winding up with bits of your rib half eaten on a ketchup-smeared plate in a diner somewhere off the motorway, and your skin used to cover the sofa.\n\nThey aren\u2019t making us feel guilty; we feel very guilty anyway. We know they are far more like us than would be comfortable; they are \u2013 in a cosmos mostly filled with inert gases and rock \u2013 fellow complex cellular life forms. They\u2019re almost our siblings. We can only go through with it by constantly telling ourselves the many ways in which they are not like us: they can\u2019t speak in finished sentences, they can\u2019t think, they can\u2019t do maths, they haven\u2019t read Plutarch \u2026 therefore what we are doing is fine, they probably don\u2019t much like life to begin with. They\u2019re almost willing to turn themselves into supper, as a way of saying thank you for all that feed. This must have been the kind of reasoning the Spanish missionaries used as they killed their way around South America.\n\nPerhaps it is too easy, as a vegan or vegetarian, to believe in one\u2019s purity. The anguished, reflexive meat-eater is maybe more properly on the horns of the human dilemma: that our lives are always at a fundamental level bought at the expense of something else; that we exist because lots of other living things died for us; that we are an incurably rapacious species; that we have no right to be anything but sickened by ourselves on every occasion on which we contemplate who we really are.\n\nThe only compensation for the cattle on their way to be shot lies in the laws of biology. The life cycle will catch up with every murderer (us) soon enough. We, in turn, will be nibbled through by starving, unguilty maggots and worms; bits of us will soon be another being\u2019s lunch and no one will, or should, cry.\n\nJan Brueghel (the Younger),Paradise, c. 1650",

      "content": "## Tahiti & Melancholy\n\nWe have, as a species, always had a strong hunch that paradise must exist and one or two settled ideas of what it might be like when we get there: warm, dotted with palm trees, rich in succulent fruits, teeming with docile animals and inhabited by a few highly welcoming and kindly people. Medieval writers summoned the place in their imaginations, Renaissance painters depicted it in their art \u2013 and by the 16th century, sailors began to head out across the oceans to find it in reality. It was at points variously identified with the coastline of Panama, the smaller Windward Islands and the north of Madagascar, but the eventual conclusion was that if paradise was located anywhere on Earth, it had to be on a large piece of basalt rock sticking out of the South Pacific 5,700 kilometres east of Australia, originally known as Otaheite and now commonly referred to as Tahiti.\n\nWhen Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, the first Frenchman to navigate the globe and explore the island, arrived with his two ships on the north-eastern coast at Hitiaa O Te Ra on 2nd April 1768, he was in no doubt as to what he had found. He described a peaceable people living on a diet of tropical fruits and fish in immaculate thatched villages near the beaches. They dressed in grass skirts and seashell necklaces, worshipped nature and the sky, were loving, athletic and graceful, and seemed to know no fear or bitterness. They had never read a book or done mathematics but seemed none the poorer for it. After ten idyllic days, Bougainville renamed the place New Cythera, after the Greek island that had in mythology been home to Aphrodite, goddess of love. In 1788, when a British expedition spent five months exploring the fruit trees of Tahiti, it was not altogether surprising that some of the sailors opted to mutiny from their ship, HMS Bounty, rather than head back up to the English Channel. Stories of Tahiti\u2019s natural majesty filtered back to Europe and inflamed public imagination. Despite Tahiti\u2019s lack of wealth and technological sophistication, it put modernity firmly to shame, for its people seemed to know something that had eluded the cleverest minds in Paris and London: how to be content.\n\nSo even now we may head to Charles de Gaulle airport, fly twelve hours to LAX, layover for four hours, then take a nine-hour flight to Fa\u2019a\u2019\u0101 International Airport, 15,700 kilometres away. \u2018Welcome to Paradise\u2019, a sign announces \u2013 not hubristically \u2013 in the corridor after customs. It is Tahiti\u2019s glory as well as its curse to have to stand in for a central piece of our imaginations.\n\nThere is enough of what Bougainville saw still in existence to ensure that we will feel we have come to the right place \u2013 the brightness of the skies on sunny mornings, the succulence of the fruits, the radiance of the flowers, the beauty of the people \u2013 now enhanced by the seven pools, five restaurants, steam rooms, yoga centre and thatched cabins of the InterContinental Tahiti Resort & Spa, nestled in a cove by the airport.\n\nPaul Gauguin,Street in Tahiti, 1891\n\nNevertheless, melancholy may descend in the tropics when it starts to rain, when the hotel guests rush in off the beach with sodden towels and take shelter in the lounge, when the manager smiles and assures everyone that it will soon pass and when we sit reading David Sweetman\u2019s definitive biography of Paul Gauguin (who came in 1891 and gave everyone syphilis), or Hilary Spurling\u2019s biography of Henri Matisse (who came in 1930 and got bored and sad in his room in the now demolished H\u00f4tel Stuart, a concrete block overlooking the waterfront in the capital, Papeete).\n\nGauguin ascribed all the island\u2019s difficulties to the influence of early 19th-century missionaries. They had made everyone sour; they had led the Tahitians to feel guilty about sex; they had encouraged the women to cover their breasts; they had made the children sing hymns.\n\nMatisse couldn\u2019t make sense of his mood. He lacked for nothing. He went for walks by the beach. He tried out a canoe. Yet he felt inadequate to such splendour. His difficult life hitherto hadn\u2019t prepared him for such felicity. What was he to do in paradise? He certainly couldn\u2019t turn it into art. It was like trying to stare at the sun. He made a few desultory attempts to sketch some flowers on his balcony and some trees by a lagoon, but he was quickly overwhelmed. Only much later, after he had returned to Europe, after a great deal more suffering had descended on him, after the Second World War, after he had developed duodenal cancer and lost the ability to walk, did the lost beauty start to haunt him: the turquoise sea, the madrepores, the Polynesian ground doves, the manta rays and giant turtles. Paradise could be allowed into the imagination only as a subject of longing, finding eventual form in an abstract precis of happiness finished shortly before his death that he called Memory of Oceania.\n\nParadise may simply not suit our nature. We have too much anxiety thrumming through our veins. We get restless, we listen to serpents, we are serpents ourselves, ready to poison and disobey. We bring \u2018ourselves\u2019 to Arcadia; that is, all our fretfulness, regret, dissatisfaction, cluelessness and suppressed rage. Those British mutineers ended up killing one another, inciting tribal warfare and, in some cases, going mad. Gauguin tried to slit his throat. It is in paradise that we may feel our inadequacies and melancholy most severely.\n\nHenri Matisse,Memory of Oceania, 1952\u20131953",

      "content": "## Revolution vs. evolution\n\nThe Romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the corner, if only bold and swift action could be taken: if we entered an agreement or scrapped an agreement, started a war or ended a war. The Romantic considers a degree of impatience to be a vital resource in governing a nation. They may not think too badly of anger, either. You can be too forgiving, after all. The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be, and always judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative. Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises and timidity of almost everyone in government.\n\nFor their part, the Melancholic voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures and actions. They pay special attention to what can go wrong. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning a policy, they consider the standard of policy across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances \u2026 Their view of people is fundamentally dark. They believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem. They feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses, lusts and drives, and believe the task of politics is to try to contain these, rather than to liberate genius, strength, beauty or benevolence. High ideals make them nervous: they are led by a desire not to make anything worse. In so far as they hope for improvement, it is in a cautious, modest way. They dare to suppose that the world may be a marginally better place \u2013 in 300 years\u2019 time.",

They recognise how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances had been different, and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness.

      "tags": "melancholy, gardening, hopelessness, optimism, resignation",
      "content": "## Gardening & Melancholy\n\nIt is crucial to note the subtitle of 18th-century Europe\u2019s most famous novel, written in three inspired days in 1759: Candide, or Optimism. If there was one central target that its author wanted satirically to destroy, it was the hope of his age, a hope that centred around science, love, technical progress and reason. Voltaire was enraged. Of course science wasn\u2019t going to improve the world; it would merely give new power to tyrants. Of course philosophy would not be able to explain away the problem of evil; it would only show up our vanity. Of course love was an illusion, power a chimera, humans irredeemably wicked and the future absurd. Of all this, his readers were to be left in no doubt. Hope was a disease and it was Voltaire\u2019s generous goal to try to cure us of it.\n\nNevertheless, Voltaire\u2019s novel is not simply a tragic tale, nor is his own philosophy mordantly nihilistic. The book ends on a memorably tender and stoic note; the tone is elegiac; we encounter one of the finest expressions of the melancholic viewpoint ever written. Candide and his companions have travelled the world and suffered immensely: they have known persecution, shipwrecks, rapes, earthquakes, smallpox, starvation and torture. They have \u2013 more or less \u2013 survived and, in the final pages, find themselves in Turkey (a country Voltaire especially admired), living on a small farm in a suburb of Istanbul. One day they learn of trouble at the Ottoman court: two viziers and the mufti have been strangled and several of their associates impaled. The news causes upset and fear in many. Near their farm, Candide, walking with his friends Martin and Pangloss, passes an old man who is peacefully and indifferently sitting under an orange bower next to his house:\n\nPangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what the name of the strangled Mufti was. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered the worthy man, \u2018and I have never known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.\u2019 Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee \u2026 after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers\u2019 beards. \u2018You must have a vast and magnificent estate,\u2019 said Candide to the Turk. \u2018I have only twenty acres,\u2019 replied the old man; \u2018I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.\u2019 Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. \u2018This honest Turk,\u2019 he said to Pangloss and Martin, \u2018seems to be in a far better place than kings \u2026 I also know,\u2019 said Candide, \u2018that we must cultivate our garden.\u2019\n\nVoltaire, who liked to stir the prejudices of his largely Christian readers, especially enjoyed giving the idea for the most important line in his book \u2013 and arguably the most important adage in modern thought \u2013 to a Muslim, the true philosopher of the book known only as \u2018the Turk\u2019: Il faut cultiver notre jardin. \u2018We must cultivate our garden\u2019, or, as it has variously been translated, \u2018we must grow our vegetables\u2019, \u2018we must tend to our lands\u2019 or \u2018we need to work our fields\u2019.\n\nWhat did Voltaire mean by his gardening advice? That we must keep a good distance between ourselves and the world, because taking too close an interest in politics or public opinion is a fast route to aggravation and danger. We should know well enough at this point that humans are troublesome and will never achieve \u2013 at a state level \u2013 anything like the degree of logic and goodness we would wish for. We should never tie our personal moods to the condition of a whole nation or people in general, or we would need to weep continuously. We need to live in our own small plots, not the heads of strangers. At the same time, because our minds are haunted and prey to anxiety and despair, we need to keep ourselves busy. We need a project. It shouldn\u2019t be too large or dependent on many other people. The project should send us to sleep every night weary but satisfied. It could be bringing up a child, writing a book, looking after a house, running a small shop or managing a little business. Or, of course, tending to a few acres. Note Voltaire\u2019s geographical modesty. We should give up on trying to cultivate the whole of humanity; we should give up on things at a national or international scale. Take just a few acres and make those your focus. Take a small orchard and grow lemons and apricots. Take some beds and grow asparagus and carrots. Stop worrying yourself with humanity if you ever want peace of mind again. Who cares what\u2019s happening in Constantinople or what\u2019s up with the grand mufti? Live quietly like the old Turk, enjoying the sunshine in the orange bower next to your house. This is Voltaire\u2019s stirring, ever-relevant form of horticultural quietism. We have been warned \u2013 and guided.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Voltaire put his lines about the cultivation of the garden into the mouth of a Muslim. He had done a lot of reading about Islam for his Essay on Universal History, published three years before, and properly understood the role of gardens in its theology. For Muslims, because the world at large can never be rendered perfect, it is the task of the pious to try to give a foretaste of what should ideally be by creating a well-tended garden (and where that is not possible, a depiction of a garden in a rug). There should be four canals that allude to the four rivers of paradise in which are said to flow water, milk, wine and honey, and where they intersect represents the umbilicus mundi, the navel of the world, where the gift of life emerged. Gardening is no trivial pastime. It\u2019s a central way of shielding ourselves from the influence of the chaotic, dangerous world beyond, while focusing our energies on something that can reflect the goodness and grace we long for.\n\nMelancholics know that humans \u2013 ourselves foremost among them \u2013 are beyond redemption. We melancholics have given up on dreams of complete purity and unblemished happiness. We know that this world is, for the most part, hellish and heartbreakingly vicious. We know that our minds are full of demons that will not leave us alone for long. Nevertheless, we are committed to not slipping into despondency. We remain deeply interested in kindness, in friendship, in art, in family life \u2013 and in spending some very quiet local afternoons gardening. The melancholic position is ultimately the only sensible one for a broken human. It\u2019s where one gets to after one has been hopeful, after one has tried love, after one has been tempted by fame, after one has despaired, after one has gone mad, after one has considered ending it \u2013 and after one has decided conclusively to keep going. It captures the best possible attitude to pain, and the wisest orientation of a weary mind towards what remains hopeful and good.\n\nBishndas, illustration from the Baburnama showing the Mughal emperor Babur supervising the laying out of a Kabul garden, c. 1590",

      "content": "## IISpecialisation\n\nOne of the greatest sorrows of work stems from a sense that only a small portion of our talents has been taken up and engaged by the job we have signed up to do every day. We are likely to be so much more than our labour allows us to be. The title on our business card is only one of thousands of titles we theoretically possess.\n\nIn his \u2018Song of Myself\u2019, published in 1855, the American poet Walt Whitman (1819\u20131892) gave our multiplicity memorable expression: \u2018I am large, I contain multitudes\u2019 \u2013 by which he meant that there are many interesting, attractive and viable versions of oneself, many good ways one could potentially live and work, and yet very few of these are ever properly played out in the course of the single life we have. No wonder that we are quietly and painfully conscious of our unfulfilled destinies, and at times recognise, with a legitimate sense of agony, that we could have been something and someone else.\n\nThe major economic reason why we cannot explore our potential as we might is that it is much more productive for us not to do so. In The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, the Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith (1723\u20131790) first explained how what he termed the \u2018division of labour\u2019 was at the heart of the increased productivity of capitalism. Smith zeroed in on the dazzling efficiency that could be achieved in pin manufacturing, if everyone focused on one narrow task (and stopped, as it were, exploring their Whitman-esque \u2018multitudes\u2019):\n\nOne man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, all performed by distinct hands. I have seen a small manufactory where they could make upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they could have made perhaps not one pin in a day.\n\n\u2013 Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 1, Of the Division of Labour (1776)\n\nAdam Smith was astonishingly prescient. Doing one job, preferably for most of one\u2019s life, makes perfect economic sense. It is a tribute to the world that Smith foresaw \u2013 and helped to bring into being \u2013 that we have ended up doing such specific jobs, and carry titles like Senior Packaging & Branding Designer, Intake and Triage Clinician, Research Centre Manager, Risk and Internal Audit Controller, and Transport Policy Consultant. We have become tiny, relatively wealthy cogs in giant, efficient machines. And yet, in our quiet moments, we reverberate with private longings to give our multitudinous selves expression.\n\nOne of Adam Smith\u2019s most intelligent and penetrating readers was the German economist Karl Marx (1818\u2013 1883). Marx agreed entirely with Smith\u2019s analysis; specialisation had indeed transformed the world and possessed a revolutionary power to enrich individuals and nations. But where he differed from Smith was in his assessment of how desirable this development might be. We would certainly make ourselves wealthier by specialising, but \u2013 as Marx pointed out with passion \u2013 we would also dull our lives and cauterise our talents. In describing his utopian communist society, Marx placed enormous emphasis on the idea of everyone having many different jobs. There were to be no specialists here. In a pointed dig at Smith, Marx wrote:\n\nIn communist society . . . nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes . . . thus it is possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, to fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner . . . without ever becoming a hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic.\n\n\u2013 Karl Marx, The German Ideology (1846)\n\nOne reason why the job we do (and the jobs we don\u2019t get to do) matters so much is that our occupations decisively shape who we are. How our characters are marked by work is often hard for us to notice, as our outlooks just feel natural to us, but we can observe the identity-defining nature of work well enough in the presence of practitioners from different fields. The primary school teacher treats even the middle-aged a little as if they were in need of careful shepherding; the psychoanalyst has a studied way of listening and seeming not to judge while exuding a pensive, reflexive air; the politician lapses into speeches at intimate dinner parties.\n\nEvery occupation weakens or reinforces aspects of our nature. There are jobs that keep us constantly tethered to the immediate moment (A&E nurse, news editor); others that train our attention on the outlying fringes of the time horizon (futurist, urban planner, reforester). Certain jobs daily sharpen our suspicions of our fellow humans, suggesting that the real agenda must always be far from what is being said overtly (journalist, antique dealer); other sorts intersect with people at candid, intimate moments of their lives (anaesthetist, hairdresser, funeral director). In some jobs, it is clear what you have to do to move forward and how promotion occurs (civil servant, lawyer, surgeon), a dynamic that lends calm and steadiness to the soul, and diminishes tendencies to plot and manoeuvre. In other jobs (television producer, politician), the rules are muddied and seem bound up with accidents of friendship and fortuitous alliances, inspiring tendencies to anxiety, distrust and shiftiness.\n\nThe psychology inculcated by work doesn\u2019t neatly stay at work; it colours the whole of who we end up being. We start to behave across our whole lives like the people work has required us to be. This tends to narrow character. When certain ways of thinking become called for daily, others start to feel peculiar or threatening. By giving a large part of one\u2019s life over to a specific occupation, one necessarily has to perform an injustice to other areas of latent potential. Whatever enlargements it offers our personalities, work also possesses a powerful capacity to trammel our spirits.\n\nWe can offer ourselves the poignant autobiographical question of what sort of people we might have been had we had the opportunity to do something else. There will be parts of us we have had to kill (perhaps rather brutally) or that lie in shadow, twitching occasionally on Sunday afternoons. Contained within other career paths are other plausible versions of ourselves \u2013 which, when we dare to contemplate them, reveal important, but undeveloped or sacrificed, elements of our characters.\n\nWe are meant to be monogamous about our work, and yet truly have talents for many more jobs than we will ever have the opportunity to explore. We can understand the origins of our restlessness when we look back at our childhoods. As children, in a single Saturday morning, we might put on an extra jumper and imagine being an Arctic explorer, then have brief stints as an architect making a Lego house, a rock star making up an anthem about cornflakes and an inventor working out how to speed up colouring in by gluing four felt-tip pens together. We\u2019d put in a few minutes as a member of an emergency rescue team, then we\u2019d try out being a pilot, brilliantly landing a cargo plane on the rug in the corridor. We would perform a life-saving operation on a knitted rabbit, and then we\u2019d find employment as a sous-chef helping make a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch. Each one of these \u2018games\u2019 might have been the beginning of a career. And yet we have to settle on only a single option, done repeatedly over the next 50 years.\n\nCompared to the play of childhood, we are leading fatally restricted lives. There is no easy cure. As Adam Smith argued, the causes don\u2019t lie in some personal error; it is a limitation forced upon us by the greater logic of a productive, competitive market economy. However, we can allow ourselves to mourn that there will always be large aspects of our character that won\u2019t be satisfied. We are not being silly or ungrateful; we are simply registering the clash between the demands of the employment market and the free, wide-ranging potential of every human life. There is a touch of sadness to this insight. But it is also a reminder that this lack of fulfilment will accompany us in whatever job we choose: we shouldn\u2019t attempt to overcome it by switching jobs. No one job can ever be enough.\n\nThere is a parallel here between our experience around work and what happens in relationships. There is no doubt that we could (without any blame attaching to a current partner) have great relationships with dozens, maybe hundreds, of different people. They would bring to the fore different sides of our personality, please us (and upset us) in different ways, and introduce us to new excitements. Yet, as with work, specialisation brings advantages: it means we can focus, bring up children in stable environments, and learn the disciplines of compromise. In love and work, life requires us to be specialists even though we are by nature equally suited for wide-ranging exploration.\n\nWe carry about within us, in embryonic form, many alluring versions of ourselves that will never be given the proper chance to live. This is a sombre thought, but also a consoling one. Our suffering is painful, but has a curious dignity, because it does not uniquely affect us as individuals. It applies as much to the CEO as to the intern; to the artist as much as to the accountant. Everyone could have found so many versions of happiness that will elude them. In suffering in this way, we are participating in the common human lot. We may with a certain melancholic pride remove the job search engine from our bookmarks and cancel our subscription to a dating site in due recognition of the fact that, whatever we do, parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and die without ever having had the chance to come to full maturity \u2013 for the sake of the benefits of focus and specialisation.",

      "content": "## IIIStandardisation\n\nThe sorrows of work are not limited to the likelihood that we will be somewhat unwillingly tied to a single field throughout our careers; even worse, our chosen field may turn out to be boring. We are liable to think that this fall into a tedious role must be our fault; a sign of our exceptional ineptitude. However, looked at dispassionately, boring jobs are an inherent and often unavoidable part of the modern economy.\n\nWhen we speak of the opposite sort of job \u2013 an interesting job \u2013 we tend to refer to work that allows for a high degree of autonomy, personal initiative and (without anything artistic being meant by the word) creativity. In an interesting job, we won\u2019t simply be following orders; we will have latitude about what path we select to meet an objective or what we think the right solution to a problem might be. A good job, defined like this, is one that allows for a good measure of personalisation: we have an opportunity to directly imprint who we are in the work we produce. We end up seeing the best parts of our personalities in the objects or services we generate.\n\nA lot of the writing about the nature of work produced in Europe and the United States in the 19th century can be read as an attempt to understand how personalisation disappeared from the labour market, even as wages rose. The English art critic and social reformer John Ruskin (1819\u20131900) proposed that the medieval building industry had been marked by a high degree of personalisation, evident in the way that craftsmen carved gargoyles (grotesque animal or human faces) in distinctive shapes high up on cathedral roofs. The stonemasons might have had to work to a fixed overall design, and their toil was not always easy, but the gargoyles symbolised a fundamental freedom to place their own stamp on their work. Ruskin added more ruefully that the new housing developments of the industrial age were allowing no such freedom or individualism to flourish in the workforce.\n\nRuskin\u2019s most devoted disciple, the poet and designer William Morris (1834\u20131896), extended the range of this idea of personalisation to a discussion of the making of furniture \u2013 his own area of expertise. Morris argued that the traditional way of making chairs and tables allowed artisans to see parts of themselves reflected in the character of the things they made. Every chair made by hand was as distinctive as its creator. In the pre-industrial age, thousands of people had been actively engaged in designing chairs, and every worker had been able to develop their own nuanced ideas about what a nice chair should be like.\n\nGargoyle, Sailsbury Cathedral Art critic John Ruskin celebrated the latitude that medieval craftsmen had to create work imbued with their own unique style.\n\nWilliam Morris, Sussex chair, c. 1860 Morris believed that the process of making artefacts by hand imbued the piece with the unique character of the maker.\n\nHowever, an inevitable part of capitalism is a process of concentration and standardisation. There is a tendency for money, expertise, marketing clout and sophisticated distribution systems to be pooled together by a few big players, who outcompete and crush rivals and so achieve a daunting position in the marketplace. Barriers to entry rise exponentially. A well-financed operation can cut costs, assiduously research the preferences of consumers, marshal the best technology, and provide goods that can be of huge appeal to consumers at the best possible price. As a result, the artisanal mode of production cannot possibly compete \u2013 as Morris himself discovered when the traditional workshop that he established to make chairs for the Victorian middle classes was forced into receivership in the wake of a price war.\n\nToday, there are, of course, still a few furniture designers around \u2013 some of them very well known \u2013 but this cannot disguise that what we call \u2018design\u2019 is quite a niche field employing a minuscule number of actors. The majority of those involved in the making and selling of furniture will have no opportunity to put their own character into the objects they are dealing with. They belong instead to a highly efficient army of labour that aims for rigorously anonymous execution.\n\nWithout intending to be mean-spirited or inherently hostile to the pleasures of work, capitalism has radically reduced the number of jobs that retain any component of personalisation.\n\nFor example, the Eames Aluminum Group chair was designed by American husband-and-wife team Charles (1907\u20131978) and Ray Eames (1912\u20131988) in 1958. It is a highly distinctive creation that reflects the ideals and outlook of the couple who designed it. If they had been artisans, operating their own small workshop, they might have sold a few dozen such chairs to their local customers in their lifetime. Instead, because they worked under capitalism for Herman Miller \u2013 a huge commercial office and home furniture manufacturing corporation \u2013 many hundreds of thousands of units have been, and continue to be, sold. A side effect of this triumph has been that the demand for well-designed, interesting chairs has been substantially cornered. Anyone wanting to make an office chair nowadays has to face the fact that it is already possible to buy a nice example, designed by two geniuses and available for rapid delivery by a global company at a competitive price from a highly efficient network of local branches.\n\nCharles and Ray Eames, Eames chair, 1958.\n\nWe are familiar with the idea that the wealth of the world is being ever more tightly concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of people \u2013 the infamous \u20181%\u2019. But capitalism doesn\u2019t only concentrate money. There\u2019s a more poignant, less familiar fact that only a small number of people \u2013 a sometimes overlapping, but often different 1% \u2013 have interesting, as in \u2018personalised\u2019, work.\n\nIt is telling that we are, at the same time, obsessed with the romance of individual genius. Our society has developed a near-fetishistic interest in the exploits of brilliant startups, colourful fashion gurus, and idiosyncratic film-makers and artists \u2013 characters who flamboyantly mould parts of the world in their own image and put their individual stamp on the things they do and make. We might like to think that we turn to them for inspiration, but it may be more the case that we use them to compensate ourselves for a painful gap in our own lives. The stories of successful personalisation have come to the fore just when the practical opportunities for personalised work have diminished. In a similar way, it was in the 19th century, during mass migration to cities, that novels about rural life achieved unprecedented popularity among newly urban audiences. We may, through our addiction to stories of lone creative geniuses, be trying to draw sustenance from qualities that are in woefully short supply in our own day-to-day working lives.\n\nThe prevalence of stories of individual creativity feed the illusion that personalised work is more normal than it really is. The many interviews and profiles mask the fact that, for almost all of us, it will prove nearly impossible to compete against the great forces of standardisation. For this reason, far more than because of anything we have done ourselves, many of us are likely to find a considerable portion of our work awkwardly tedious and dispiritingly free of any opportunities to carve our own gargoyles.",

      "content": "## IVCommercialisation\n\nA complaint regularly aired around many careers is that, in order to succeed at them, there is no option but to \u2018sell out\u2019. It appears that we will inevitably face a choice between authenticity and penury on the one hand, and idiocy and wealth on the other. We are familiar with this complaint in the arts, of course. But the same dilemma shows up when an interesting restaurant seems unable to make a profit; when a specialist bread company goes into receivership; when a garden supply firm focusing on rare native plants can\u2019t get a foothold in the market; when a sincere news site can\u2019t turn a profit, or when an ethically based investment firm is doomed to operate on a tiny scale in comparison with its less high-minded competitors.\n\nBehind the complaint lies a very understandable but ambitious yearning: that our most passionately held beliefs and enthusiasms should, relatively painlessly, and by virtue of their merits, become high priorities for others. Our instincts lead us to suppose that what we are convinced of should prove equally compelling to strangers.\n\nYoung children are particularly prone to this assumption. On meeting a new adult, they may enthusiastically suggest that they join them in playing a favourite game, perhaps brew something on the miniature kitchen stove, or impersonate one of their dolls, which shows how hard it is for a child to grasp how alien his or her pleasures might be to another person. Children aren\u2019t silly; they are just highly attuned to their own natures and are convinced that others will share their tastes. In a naive but representative way, they illustrate an instinct that stays with us all of our lives: the supposition that others will and must be moved by what moves us; that their value systems are, or should be, like ours; and that what we love can automatically be what the world loves.\n\nThe reality is often humiliatingly and enragingly different. A novel that is filled with subtle character analyses and that takes inventive risks with plot structure might sell only modestly, while one that pits good against evil in a predictable way, relies on well-tried narrative tricks and arrives at an implausibly happy ending will dominate the bestseller lists. A high-street chain might do a fabulous trade in cut-price dark grey polyester-cotton socks, while a thoughtful, original brand involving striking colour combinations and materials ethically sourced from Peru will fail to find a market.\n\nIt is tempting to arrive at a despairing conclusion: that the economy is inherently devoted to delivering a personal affront to the better aspects of human nature. The truth is much less vindictive, but the tendency for the market to overlook or at least remain cool in relation to our more sincere and earnest efforts is nevertheless real \u2013 and founded on a raft of identifiable and stubborn forces in economic and psychological life.\n\nOne of the most basic of these forces is choice. It is in the nature of a growing, successful economy always to expand the range of choices offered to a consumer, and thereby, always to minimise the a priori claims of any one product or service. We can track the characteristic features of this development in relation to media. In 1952, a BBC radio broadcast of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony attracted an audience of five million listeners \u2013 approximately 16% of the UK\u2019s adult population. Today, such a broadcast would claim a fraction of these numbers. What explains the difference is not \u2013 as some cultural pessimists might claim \u2013 that the UK population has over a few generations become less sensitive to the emotive force of German Romantic music; the fundamental difference is that today\u2019s audience has many more options. In 1952, there were very few competing sources of entertainment. People listened en masse to the classical end of BBC radio because there was nothing much else to do. A producer who worked in the corporation had a great deal more authority than today\u2019s equivalent, not on the basis of superior genius, but because his listeners had few viable alternatives. This, rather nicely, gave certain high-brow things more opportunity to be attended to; but it also meant that many substandard services and products could enjoy a far larger role than their intrinsic merit warranted.\n\nWe know from the study of certain natural habitats that in situations of abundant choice (the warm seas around the Seychelles, for example), attention goes towards members of the species that appear colourful, variegated and theatrical. Much the same holds true for companies amid the din and buzz of the human marketplace. What is brusquely called \u2018selling out\u2019 typically refers to a series of moves no more and no less sinister than the elaborate signalling to which all living things must submit in their efforts to be noticed. Amid plenty, products and services must throw their qualities into dramatic relief, puff out their virtues, sound more confident than they perhaps are, and lodge themselves in the minds of their distracted audiences with unabashed insistence. It is understandable if those who are committed to higher values may balk at such demands, resentfully condemning the pitilessness of an unfeasibly vulgar system.\n\nThere is another reason why modern audiences are likely to sidestep opportunities for high-minded consumption: because they are exhausted. Modern work demands a punishing amount from its participants. We typically return from our jobs in a state of depletion: frazzled, tired, bored, enervated, sad. In such a state, the products and services for which we will be in the mood have to be of a very particular cast. We may be too brutalised to care much about the suffering of others, or to think empathetically of unfortunates in faraway tea plantations or cotton fields. We may have endured too much tedium to stay patient with arguments that are intelligently reticent and studiously subtle. We may be too anxious to have the strength to explore the more sincere sections of our own minds. We may hate ourselves a bit too much to want to eat and drink only what is good for us. Our lives may be too lacking in meaning to concentrate only on what is meaningful. To counterbalance what has happened at work, we may instinctively gravitate towards what is excessively sweet, salty, distracting, easy, colourful, explosive, sexual and sentimental.\n\nThis collectively creates a vicious circle. What we consume ends up determining what we produce \u2013 and, in turn, the quality of jobs that are on offer. So long as we only have the emotional resources to consume at the more narcotic and compromised end of the market, we will only generate employment that is itself challenged in meaning and compromised in dignity \u2013 which will further increase our demand for lower-order goods and services. We seem hampered by our existing conditions of employment from properly developing the sort of temperaments that could strengthen the sincerity and seriousness of our appetites and so expand the range of meaningful and non-depleting jobs we could have access to.\n\nThe price we pay for a marketplace that refuses to support high-minded efforts is not just practical and economic; it is also at some level emotional. One of our greatest cravings is to be recognised and accepted for who we are. We long for careful, insightful appreciation of our characters and interests. This was, if things went tolerably well, a little like what happened to us in earliest childhood, when a kindly adult, through the quality of their love, spared us any requirement to impress or, as we might put it, to market ourselves. In those early years, we did not need assiduously to \u2018sell\u2019 who we were; we did not have to smile in exaggerated ways, sound happier than we were, put on seductive accents or compress what we had to say into memorable jingles. We could take our time, hesitate, whisper, be a little elusive and complex and as serious as we needed to be \u2013 sure that another would be there to find, decode and accept us. Everything we learnt of love ran counter to the mechanisms of commercialisation.\n\nIt is no wonder if we harbour within us a degree of instinctive revulsion against commercial strictures. The need not to sell ourselves aggressively was not just part of an earlier, simpler point in the history of the world (as scholars rightly point out); it was, more poignantly, also a moment in each of our personal histories, to which we may always long to return.",

      "content": "## VScale\n\nOne of the strangest aspects of work is that we don\u2019t do it solely, or sometimes even principally, for money. This makes us vulnerable not just to poverty, but also to crises of a more psychological kind. We harbour a demanding ambition to find work that can provide us with something that can best be captured by the word \u2018meaning\u2019. We hunger for this meaning quite as much as we crave status or enrichment. Meaningful work comprises any activity that impacts positively on another\u2019s life, either by reducing suffering or increasing pleasure \u2013 a definition that can encompass everything from the life-saving interventions of the cardiac surgeon to the seductive efforts of a pastry chef or Anatolian rug-weaver.\n\nIn truth, the vast majority of jobs contribute in some way to the welfare of others. Only a very few are properly devoid of meaning; for example, a career devoted to making fake remedies for hair loss or cancer, or one encouraging those on low incomes to gamble more. However, crucially, a great many jobs are in the odd position of being meaningful while not in any way feeling meaningful.\n\nThis problem is rife in the modern age for a very particular reason: the changes in the scale and tempo of work ushered in by industrialisation. Most work now takes place within gigantic organisations that are engaged in a variety of large, complicated and slow-moving projects \u2013 and where it can therefore be hard to derive, on a daily basis, any tangible sense of having improved anyone else\u2019s life in any way. The customer and the end product are, in the gigantic structures of modernity, simply too far-flung in space and too distant in time. It can be hard to reassure ourselves of our worth and purpose when we are only a single unit among a 20,000-strong team on four continents pushing forward a project that might be ready in five years.\n\nThere are sound reasons why the work practices of large organisations proceed at a glacial pace. Product development in sectors such as aeronautics and banking, oil and pharmaceuticals cannot happen overnight. The time frames are logical, but in terms of individual experience, they go directly against our natural, deeply embedded preference for a rapidly unfolding story.\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (385 BCE\u2013323 BCE) observed that a key requirement for a satisfying piece of theatre was that it should be over relatively quickly. There might be tensions and complications and unexpected changes of direction, but in a few hours and three acts, there should be a feeling of genuine completion.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in theatre that speed is attractive. The concentration of action also helps to explain the appeal of sport. In ninety minutes, a football match can take us from a perfect, neutral start to a precise result. However, if football were like modern work in terms of scale and pace, one can imagine it unfolding on eighteen pitches with twenty-two balls and 10,800 players kicking around for thousands of days without any overview of the progress of the game. By the standards of our innate longings, our work unfolds in a disordered, overextended and confusing way.\n\nOur labour feels meaningful not only when it is fast, but also when we get to witness the ways we are helping others; when we can leave the office, factory or shop with an impression of having fixed a problem in someone else\u2019s life. This pleasure too is threatened by scale. In the massive organisations of modernity, we may be so distant from the end users of our products and services as to be unable to derive any real benefit from our constructive role in their lives. Spending days improving terms on contracts in the logistics industry truly will lead to a moment when a couple can contentedly enjoy some ginger biscuits together in front of the TV; optimising data management across different parts of an aerospace firm \u2013 along with thousands of other coordinated efforts \u2013 truly will contribute to the moment when a young family can bond together on a beach holiday. The connections are genuine, but they may be so extended and convoluted as to feel dispiritingly flimsy and unreal in our minds.\n\nIt\u2019s a tantalising paradox, and a kind of tragedy, that because of the unavoidable scale of modern work, we may pass our lives helping other people \u2013 and yet, day to day, be burdened by a harrowing feeling of having made no difference whatsoever.",

      "content": "## VICompetition\n\nAt the heart of how all individuals function, there is a dream of security: security from humiliation, penury, dependence, arbitrary dismissal and uncertainty.\n\nAt the heart of how a modern capitalist economy functions, there is a dream of competitive advantage: one based on the intelligent exploitation of invested capital, on the effective deployment of technology, raw material and labour to reduce costs and improve quality and the triumph over competitors so as to maximise shareholder return.\n\nAt certain points, these two longings \u2013 those of individuals and those of capitalism \u2013 seem inherently aligned. At other points, it can seem as if our own well-being has grown entirely irrelevant to the economic machine in which we are enmeshed. We generally don\u2019t kick the machine; we are far more inclined to blame ourselves. There is, after all, always enough evidence of people who thrive and succeed to suggest to us that the fault must lie with something we have done. But in our more politically engaged moments, we may dare to complain that the system is not working \u2018as it should\u2019.\n\nIronically, at precisely such moments, it is probably working very well; it\u2019s just that it was never intended to work in the way we would like \u2013 for our own well-being. Capitalism does not place the longings and aspirations of the labour force at the heart of its operations (the clue to its essential concerns lies in its name). It was not made to ensure that we have secure, good lives, plenty of time off and pleasant relationships with our families; it was made to maximise shareholder return. Labour has exactly the same status within capitalism as other production inputs, neither more nor less. Alongside rent, the price of fuel, plant, technology and taxes, labour (people) is just another cost. That it happens to be a \u2018cost\u2019 that cries, needs time off, has fragile nerves, sometimes catches the flu and in extremis commits suicide is \u2013 at most \u2013 a puzzling inconvenience. We should not believe that there is anything faulty about capitalism simply because we have minimal security of employment, little time to see our families, a lot of stress and an uncertain future. These belong to the very conditions that help the system to work well. Our mistake, which has imposed a heavy internal burden on us, has been to confuse our own ambitions for happiness with the goals of the overall economy.\n\nWe have innocently viewed a range of anxieties and fears as incidental and solvable, when they are in fact basic necessities for the correct functioning of enterprise. The first and largest of these is the fear of dismissal. A capitalist economy could not work well without it. It is a precondition of efficient business both that existing labour can be removed swiftly and cheaply and that there should be a ready supply of cooperative replacements. Unemployment is not a tragedy for business; it contributes to a willing pool of talent with low bargaining power.\n\nEven the collapse and shuttering of whole firms is not to be lamented overall. Inefficient players who have failed to read market signals have to close, and their capital has to be deployed elsewhere. There is nothing less healthy for capitalism than an economy in which venerable firms, some perhaps very long established and with thousands of loyal workers within them, can\u2019t regularly and cleanly go bust.\n\nThe relationship we form with a company may last as long as a marriage, and we may give it as much time and devotion as we would give to a partner. But this is a relationship that should, for capitalism to flourish, be close to abusive, because our \u2018spouse\u2019 must at any point be allowed, on the grounds that they could save themselves 3% a year, fire us and take up with a more cooperative and flexible rival in Vietnam or Bolivia.\n\nWe have taken care to construct a world where, in many areas, there is an extreme sensitivity to upset and distress. We have rigorous health and safety requirements to ensure that people don\u2019t fall off ladders or strain their backs when moving heavy boxes. We make sure that words aren\u2019t used to demean or prejudice minorities. Kindergartens present a moving picture of our care for the next generation. Yet in the core area of our work, we operate in a system that is \u2013 from an emotional point of view \u2013 nothing short of inhuman. But through more sober economic lenses, it isn\u2019t anything as alarming: it is merely admirably competitive.\n\nA second fear that prevails is that of not having done enough. We lie awake at night worrying about certain tasks we failed to perform. We cannot stop thinking about what certain competitors may be up to. We panic about the upcoming financial results. We don\u2019t sleep very well any more.\n\nThis too makes sense. It used to be far tougher on capitalists. Regular breaks used to be mandated. Religion was responsible for many of them; it told people that they should down tools and honour something far more important than their work, like the majesty of the creator of the whole world. This glance upwards to the heavens relativised and calmed the workforce; it put things in perspective and lent a relieving sense that those packages in the warehouse could probably be sent next week after all. On a bad day, there might even be a sermon reminding people to treat workers like God\u2019s children and to respect the holiness of every individual, however lowly.\n\nIn certain countries, labour organised itself and demanded that everyone in the company had to be given decent conditions and the odd holiday, or else the staff would walk out on strike. There were angry marches and some insane demands to restrict who could be fired and when.\n\nThere were some very frustrating limits to technology as well. There was the post, but it took an age. You might have to wait two weeks for a letter and there might be little to do in that time other than check up on the garden, go for long walks, read three Russian novels and talk to the children. Travel for work took an equal eternity. You might be sent to Hamburg by the firm, which could take four whole days, three of them at sea, some of them spent slowly eating kartoffelsalat and schnitzel, chatting to fellow passengers and staring out from the ship\u2019s window at the wheat fields near Neuharlingersiel.\n\nIt has been a miracle and an unbounded relief for capitalism that this painful age has at last passed. Religion now seldom gets in the way. Its irritating, calming pieties have been replaced by far more robust and motivating narratives drawn from social Darwinism. The labour movement has been effectively pulverised by flattering ambitious workers into believing that they would gain far more by ditching their fellow Indians and aiming to become chiefs themselves. Technology has at last made it possible for the line between leisure and work to be erased. We\u2019ve been able to give people phones to make sure they are findable at all times and incentivised them to regard these devices as toys for their benefit rather than glorified tracking bracelets for their firms. Travel has been hugely speeded up too, so it is now possible to squeeze in meetings on a couple of continents in just a single day. There is blessedly little time left that a worker can call their own.\n\nThe consequence is that we now have almost no energy left to invest in our personal lives. We constantly search for that elusive holy grail quaintly described by magazines as \u2018work/life balance\u2019. But anyone who sincerely believes that such an equilibrium might be possible has not begun to understand the logic of capitalism.\n\nWork and love are our two greatest idols. But they are also locked in mortal combat. Work tends to win. The complaints against work from within love are notorious: we are never around, we are always tired, we never give our partner our wholehearted attention, we are obsessive about the office. It is helpful to recognise that modern ideas of love were invented in the late 18th century by artistic people who didn\u2019t have real jobs and therefore made great play of the importance of spending time with a lover explaining and sharing feelings and recounting the movements of one\u2019s heart. Unfortunately, combining Romanticism and modern capitalism, as we are expected to do, is a near-impossible task. The impressive philosophy of Romantic love \u2013 with its emphasis on intimacy and openness \u2013 sits very badly alongside the requirements of working routines that fill our heads with complex demands, keep us away from home for long stretches and render us insecure about our positions in a competitive environment.\n\nAccording to the Romantic ideal, a lover can be kind and good only when they readily communicate their feelings. But the level of openness this assumes is wholly at odds with the realities of work. After a tricky day (or week), our mind\u2019s are likely to be numb with worries and duties. We may not feel like doing much besides sitting in silence, staring at the kitchen appliances, running through a series of dramas and crises. Such preoccupation is not pleasant to witness: it risks expressing itself in a range of not very endearing symptoms: grunting, sighing, brooding silence and a short-fused temper. The most innocuous-sounding question about how the day might have gone can elicit a growl \u2013 then, if it is repeated, an explosion.\n\nIf there is consolation to be found, it lies in knowing enough history to realise that failure isn\u2019t personal. It isn\u2019t one\u2019s own incompetence or lack of drive that has set one\u2019s work and private life at loggerheads. We just happen to be living at a point in time when two big, opposed themes are at war, when we have demanding ideas about the needs of families and relationships and equally demanding ideas about work, efficiency, profit and competition. Both are founded on crucial insights; both aim to monopolise our lives. We deserve a high dose of sympathy for the situation we find ourselves in.",

      "content": "## VIICollaboration\n\nOne of the most frightening aspects of working life is that we will, unless we are the beneficiaries of extreme good fortune, be required to have colleagues. The colleague is a creature who, endured over any length of time in situations of high stress and procedural complexity, presents one of the greatest threats to calm, composure and soundness of mind.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, in the 19th century, one specific working environment developed into a hugely popular subject for painters: the artist\u2019s studio. Archetypal paintings of studios showed high-ceilinged rooms with large windows, views over neighbouring rooftops, sparse furniture, messy tables covered in tubes of paint, and half-finished masterpieces propped up against the walls. There was one additional factor that particularly enticed the collective imagination: there was no one in the studio apart from the artist. At exactly the time when more and more people were being gathered into ever-larger offices and experiencing for the first time all the attendant compromises and constrictions, there grew a craving for paintings of an alternative utopia; a place of work consolingly free of the damnable presence of the colleague.\n\nWe have ended up in offices not by bad luck, but by the unavoidable fact that the mighty tasks of modern capitalism simply cannot be undertaken on one\u2019s own. It remains (sadly) impossible to run an airline or to manage a bank solo.\n\nThe problem with colleagues begins with the fundamental challenge associated with trying to communicate the contents of one\u2019s mind to another person. When we are doing things by ourselves, the flow of information is immediate and friction-free. If we could listen in to our inner monologues, they would be made up of a speedy and baffling series of assertions and jumbled words: \u2018narr, yes. Come on! Do it till then, after no more. Ah, nearly, no, no, no, no, back . . . OK, got it, got it . . . No! Yes. That\u2019s fine. So.\u2019\n\nBut when we collaborate, we must laboriously turn the stream of consciousness that only we can follow into unwieldy, externally comprehensible messages. We have to translate feelings into language, temper our wilder impulses and affix paragraphs to intuitions in order to generate prompts and suggestions that have a chance of being effective in the minds of other people.\n\nBy a painful quirk of psychology, others can\u2019t by instinct alone understand what we need and want \u2013 although it can seem as though they surely must. The realisation that other people are not like us and can\u2019t guess what we want takes a long time to sink in \u2013 and the idea perhaps always remains a bit foreign and unjust. In their earliest days, babies simply don\u2019t realise that their mothers are separate beings, and so get frustrated when these reluctant appendages don\u2019t by magic obey their unstated wishes. Only after a long and difficult process of development (if ever) can a child realise that their parent is truly a distinct individual, and that, in order to make themselves understood by them, they will have to do more than grunt and imagine solutions in their heads. It can be the work of a lifetime, in which the office occupies a particularly painful passage, to gradually accept the impossibility of mutual mind reading.\n\nIf this were not bad enough, many colleagues are at risk of not sharing our underlying vision of what should be done. They have contrary opinions, their own quirks, pet peeves and obsessive interests. To get our point across and assuage their resistance requires us to deploy a battery of diplomatic skills. At the very moment when, agitated and overwhelmed, we would like simply to shout or bark, we have no option but to charm. This is because the colleague is, on top of it all, extremely sensitive. Unless they are spoken to correctly, they will become offended, develop grudges, start to cry or report us to a superior.\n\nThe imperative to be pleasant at work is a novel one that we are still getting used to. In the olden days, brusqueness used to be the norm: it was a good way to get people to turn a boat swiftly starboard, push coal trolleys faster, or increase the rate of production at the blast furnace in a steel mill. When most work was physical, management could be abrupt; workers could feel underappreciated or bullied and nevertheless perform their required tasks to perfection. Emotional distress didn\u2019t hold things up. You could still operate the brick-making machine at maximum speed, even if you hated the manager, or clean out the stables thoroughly even if you felt the foreman hadn\u2019t enquired deeply enough into the nature of your weekend.\n\nBut nowadays, most jobs require a high degree of psychological well-being in order to be performed adequately. A wounding comment can destroy a person\u2019s productivity for a whole day. Without ample respect, recognition and encouragement, huge sums of money will be wasted in silently resentful moods. If we have any concern for the bottom line, we have no alternative but to try to be a little bit nice.\n\nAt the same time, the inability to speak frankly has its own enormous cost. A huge amount of valuable information that should make its way around a company is held back by the imperative not to cause offence. We hold our tongues because we are scared to upset juniors, to alienate colleagues and to ruin our relationships with superiors \u2013 and, in the process, insights that might help an organisation to thrive stay locked in individual hearts.\n\nWork relationships are no less tricky than romantic ones, but at least in the latter we have a basic sense of security that enables us to speak our minds and make the necessary cathartic moves \u2013 to call the other person a fuckwit and compress a range of ideas into the occasional expletive-loaded outburst. The office environment misses out on the cleansing frankness seemingly possible only when two people know they will have the option of having sex together after a bust-up.\n\nAt the heart of our office agonies is the complaint that we seldom like our colleagues as people. In a better world, we would be unlikely ever to want to spend any time with such disturbing, and often unlikely, figures. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised by our daily discomfort, given that these people were never picked out on the basis of psychological compatibility. We were formed into a unit because they had a range of technical and commercial competences necessary for a task, not because they were fun lunch companions or were graced with a pleasing manner. We are like the unfortunate bride in a power-marriage in the Middle Ages. A princess would be obliged to marry a certain prince because he owned an important lead mine or because the archers in his country were especially proficient. It would have been nice if the two liked each other as well, but the stakes were generally too high for this to be a relevant factor. The success of the realm depended on such matters as access to raw materials and military strength, not on whether one partner had a maddening giggle or a daunting overbite.\n\nThere is yet another challenge posed by colleagues. Corporations and businesses are fundamentally hierarchical, with an ever-smaller number of desirable, better-rewarded places at the pinnacle. A naive outsider might imagine that career progression would be determined by clear, precise and public determinants of merit, probably of a technical or financial sort, akin to the straightforward nature of the examination results we all grew up with. But the reality is that, in many occupations, no verifiable measure of performance is available. Factors of success are numerous, opaque and shifting. What decides who is promoted is not talent per se, but success at a range of dark psychological arts best summed up by the term \u2018politics\u2019.\n\nPolitical skill has woefully little in common with the reasons we were trained and hired to do our jobs in the first place. We may, as part of a good business education, have spent years studying how to navigate a balance sheet, analyse competitors, negotiate contracts, and administer a logistics chain. But when we reach the office, we will be confronted by other, less familiar, kinds of challenges: the person at the desk opposite us with the charming manner who enthusiastically agrees with whomever they\u2019re speaking to, yet harbours a range of toxic reservations and privately pursues their own undeclared agenda; the person who responds to polite criticism or well-meaning feedback with hurt and fury; the person who pretends to be our friend, but takes the credit for our best efforts.\n\nIn such situations, the most unlovely qualities may turn out to be the most necessary ones: the capacity to quietly accept glory for things that were not truly our doing; to distance ourselves from errors in which we were heavily implicated; to subtly foreground the failings of otherwise quite able colleagues; to turn cold at key moments towards emotionally vulnerable superiors; to flatter while not appearing to do so; to mould our views to suit the currently ascendant attitudes.\n\nSuch grey, underhand strategies are not easy to pick up, and they may feel impossible for us to practise if we pride ourselves on being straightforward, direct or even just somewhat ethical. Yet we can be certain that every high-minded refusal of duplicity will carry a heavy, perhaps career-damaging, cost.\n\nOur problems with the collegial nature of work are compounded by the implication that matters should be straightforward. Our inevitable difficulties are aggravated by notions that offices are at heart giant families; that colleagues can be friends; that honesty is rewarded, and that talent will win out. Kindly sentimentality is, in the end, just a disguised version of cruelty. It might be simpler if, in dark moments, we could simply admit to what we know in our hearts: that it would obviously be better if we could be shot of the whole business of colleagues and spend our days, as we used to so well, sitting comfortably on the floor in our room assembling cargo planes, city car parks and bear picnics on our own.",

      "content": "## VIIIEqualOpportunity\n\nThe modern world was founded upon, and continues to be enthused by, the promise of equal opportunity \u2013 and infinite possibility \u2013 for all. Each of us grows up with a sense that a great deal could be possible. Adults listen respectfully when small children suggest they might travel to the Space Station, run the country or play for a winning team. Such feats aren\u2019t wholly fanciful, particularly when considered through parental eyes. Similarly transformative journeys are everywhere to behold. It would be churlish to ignore that extraordinary destinies are a regular feature of modern life.\n\nThe idea of equal opportunity springs from the most generous side of our nature and has been responsible for inspiring the most indispensable achievements. But it has also, unwittingly and far more quietly, been the source of unending sorrow. American psychologist William James (1842\u20131910) recognised the anxiety created by societies that promise their inhabitants infinite opportunities for social transformation and career success \u2013 and then can\u2019t always deliver. For James, satisfaction with ourselves does not require us to succeed in every area. We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are humiliated only if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it. Our ambitions determine what we will interpret as a triumph and what must count as a failure. \u2018With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,\u2019 wrote James. \u2018It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities\u2019. Thus:\n\nThe problem with the modern world is that it does not stop lending us extremely high expectations and inviting us to dream, and then leaving us with a bitter sense of failure.\n\nA firm belief in the limitations of life was once one of humankind\u2019s most important assets; a bulwark against bitterness and envy; a wisdom cruelly undermined by the ideology of infinite expectation proclaimed by the modern worldview. Feeling \u2018successful\u2019 might not be so much about having many things, as a matter of having what we long for. Success is not an absolute. It is relative to desire; every time we seek something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, whatever our resources.\n\nInsofar as advanced societies provide us with many options for success, they appear to be helping us. But in truth, the net effect may be to humiliate us: through a language of unlimited opportunity, these societies keep open a permanent gap between who we want to be and what we have achieved. There are two ways to make people feel more successful: to give them more success, or to narrow their ambitions. Modern capitalism has in certain areas succeeded spectacularly at the first option, but, by stretching our aspirations, it has left a painful gap between our hopes and our reality \u2013 a gap we are left to fill with shame and rage.",

      "content": "## IXMeritocracy\n\nModern politicians across the political spectrum show remarkable agreement on one goal: that of creating a fully meritocratic society, a society in which all those who make it to the top do so because of their own talents and abilities, rather than due to unfair privilege, upper-class parents or connections. The stated aim is to create a hierarchy based on ability, replacing chinless halfwits with the meritorious, wherever they may be found and whatever age, colour or gender they might be.\n\nThis meritocratic ideal has brought opportunity to millions. Gifted and intelligent individuals who for centuries were held down within immobile, caste-like hierarchies are now free to express their talents on a more or less level playing field. We have largely turned the page on a world that was filled with rulers who were too sick or stupid to govern; lords who couldn\u2019t manage their estates; commanders who didn\u2019t understand the principles of battle; peasants who were brighter than their masters, and maids who knew more than their mistresses. No longer is background an impassable obstacle to advancement. An element of justice has finally entered the distribution of rewards.\n\nBut there is a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: if we truly believe that we have created (or could one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it follows that we have to hold the \u2018failures\u2019 exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable, but also deserved.\n\nSucceeding financially (without inheritance or contacts) in an economic meritocracy endows individuals with an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old, who had been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel. But, at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also been spared. The question of why, if one is good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.\n\nThere has turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the \u2018failed\u2019. For a certain constituency, it is clear that the failures owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy. With the rise of an economic meritocracy, in certain quarters, the failures have moved from being described as \u2018unfortunates\u2019, the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally-minded rich, to being described as \u2018losers\u2019, fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust self-made individuals, who are disinclined to feel ashamed about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they have escaped. In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in meritocratic societies, it has become possible to argue that social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder so that conditions are already in place for the good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder \u2013 attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures or simple compassion. To the injury of poverty, a meritocratic system has added the insult of humiliation.\n\nIt is a symptom of our faith in meritocracy that it has largely become impossible to explain away professional failure as the result of \u2018bad luck\u2019. Although it is granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping our careers, the evaluation of people proceeds, in practical terms, as if they could fairly be held responsible for their biographies. It would seem unduly (and even suspiciously) modest to ascribe a victory to \u2018good luck\u2019 and, more importantly in this context, pitiable to blame defeat on the opposite. Winners make their own luck, insists the modern mantra, which would have puzzled the ancient Roman worshippers of the Goddess of Fortune.\n\nWe are paying a heavy price for our faith in a fairer world: that of having to take full responsibility for what we achieve and, more poignantly, fail to achieve, in the course of our lives.",

We were not uncommonly stupid. We were tricked into misunderstanding the statistics of success, in mistaking the unique for the possible. We longed for glorious destinies, of which there are always far fewer than there are numbers of the aspiring and the ardent. The game is close to rigged so as to cause heartbreak on a mass scale, although the sadness rarely recognises itself as collective, and is experienced in each individual soul as a uniquely personal defeat.\n\nOur minds are partly to blame. We are hardwired for ambitious plans. It isn\u2019t our nature to rest with what is already to hand or easy to reach. We are inherently ungrateful, and feel alive only when we have taken on a struggle that has a good chance of crushing us. Even those we think of as successes will secretly nurse dreams they have had to forego. There is always a gap between achievement and desire. Feeling like a failure is the inevitable price for harbouring any sort of ambition.\n\nWe would be mad not to strive for success, but we will end up demented if we don\u2019t also, over time, develop capacities for making peace with defeat. The task begins with forewarning, with a secure, calm, dark knowledge that we will inevitably be tripped up along the way.\n\nWe need to be free of a sense of persecution in this regard. It truly was not personal. Our dreams are like a fragile house of twigs exposed to a hurricane. We should stop fixating on what life has done to us, and check in with what it is doing to others every day \u2013 the ones who never make it into the magazines; the legions of the quietly despairing and dying. It is no loser\u2019s counsel to work with a vivid sense of how much worse it might, and will still, get.\n\nWe should make ourselves at home with mediocrity.\n\n\u2018Failure\u2019 sounds like too extreme a word for something that is so normal. We should be more alive to its ubiquity and wear it with greater ease, as something \u2013 like death \u2013 that is coming for us all. We might laugh defiantly at its embrace, refuse to be cowed by it and mock our pretensions without remorse or self-importance.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy, of course, that we are typically surrounded by people trapped in a toxic ideology of ambition. The first question we will be asked when meeting almost any new person is: \u2018What do you do?\u2019 If our answer is insufficiently elevated, we will at once notice the loss of interest and our total dispensability to most members of the race.\n\nThese things continue to matter more than they should. We should try to be gentle on ourselves. We could reduce how often we\u2019ll be exposed to this sort of judgement. We might attempt to develop an identity not so exclusively connected to achievement, so that who we are becomes bound up not just with salary and rank, but also our character, our relationships, our interests and our unmonetised and unpublished skills.\n\nWe should learn the wisdom of a degree of melancholy in relation to our work, founded on an understanding that the sorrow isn\u2019t just about us; that our suffering belongs to humanity in general. This should not make us desperate, but rather more forgiving of our failure, kinder to that of others and better able to focus on what really matters, while there is still time.\n\nPicture Credits\n\np.31\n\nGargoyle Sailsbury Cathredral, WiltshireCoombs Images / Alamy Stock Photo\n\np.32\n\nSussex chair, c. 1860\n\nWebb, Philip Speakman (designer)Morris & Co.

      "content": "# Introduction\n\nThe Roots of Adversity and the Nature of this Book\n\nEveryone knows that life contains many adversities: we all experience loss, failure, disappointment, waste and pain in various different forms and ways. This is so obviously\n  the case that we rarely reflect on why things are like this. But if we want to understand how we might respond constructively to adversity we would do well to start by thinking about why there is\n  adversity in human life at all. Adversity is, I shall suggest, inevitable. There is nothing we can do to escape it wholly. But that, far from being a negative thought, is immensely liberating,\n  because it allows us to gain a realistic perspective on ourselves and on what we can really do to make sense of, and turn to account, the adversity we experience in life.\n\nLimited Resources\n\nWe who live in the developed world are extremely fortunate. In many ways, we live in a world of plenty and of opportunity. We do not, in general, have to worry about the\n  availability of food and shelter, of medical services and of educational opportunities, though the absurdities of how we organize things ensure that such resources are much more unequally\n  distributed than they might be. Nonetheless, we do not live in a world of limitless resources and human beings are normally manifestly in competition with each other for them \u2013 concrete\n  resources like income and property, but also more intangible resources, such as fame, reputation, status and so on. We see such competition in the job or housing market, for example, and in our\n  desire for career advancement. Further, we are extremely physically vulnerable creatures, whose bodies are very easily damaged. We often fail to acknowledge this, even though we know it, because,\n  in general, we experience much better health than any human beings in history. But a visit to your local A&E department will remind you just how vulnerable the human body is.\n\nFor these reasons, we naturally seek for ourselves, and for those about whom we care, the best possible conditions of security. We all seek to shore up our position in the world, and, although\n  different individuals conceive of safety and security in somewhat different ways, our desire and need for them inevitably mean that we clash with others, because we are seeking pretty much the same\n  things as others, under conditions of limited resources. In other words, we come up against adversity.\n\nBut human beings are not just physically vulnerable; they are deeply psychologically vulnerable as well. This vulnerability comes about partly because human desires and needs are potentially\n  limitless, in the sense that they feed off each other and the world around them in such a way that human beings always seek more \u2013 more of what they have already, or more of something new.\n  There are, in my view, reasons deep within human psychology why this is so. In particular, three ideas from the writings of Samuel Johnson seem to me to be especially useful in understanding this:\n  the hunger of the imagination; the vacuity of life; and the craving for novelty.\n\nThe Hunger of the Imagination\n\nThe human mind, Johnson pointed out, is not a passive recipient of information from the outside. It does not neutrally register what is going on out there. On the contrary, it\n  is an active force with a life of its own, energetic, febrile, forever in motion, like a kind of unruly or disruptive creature. It is intolerant of limitation and restraint, and seeks to expend\n  itself. It lives very largely in the past and the future, reflecting on what has been and propelling itself onto potential plans, projects, ambitions and aims. It is, in short, hungry.\n\nThis hunger is expressed in the workings of the imagination. It is because we are imaginative creatures that we can construct ideas and images of what the future might be like, formulate plans,\n  initiate change and so on. We can see how things could be different, and, in our hunger, we reach out to make things correspond to the image we have: it might be that we want to buy\n  something, or travel somewhere, or visit a friend, or learn something new, or change career \u2013 and so on, in countless ways. But because the mind is so hungry we find that once we achieve our\n  goal we remain hungry: we want more of the same, or something different \u2013 or, paradoxically, both. This is why Plato saw human beings as like leaky buckets: pour the water in and, rather than\n  staying put, it will flow out of the bottom. We can never be \u2018full\u2019, in this sense, more than momentarily. Other thinkers have followed Plato, changing the metaphor, seeing us as on a\n  treadmill of desire, forever turning round and never coming to a halt.\n\nOf course, all this has a positive side: we are able to mould the future in away that other animals cannot, and we can secure ourselves in various ways against troubles and difficulties. But the\n  profoundly disturbing aspect of the hunger of the imagination is that the experience of desire is always potentially traumatic: we have desires, but we are also caught up in them.\n  They can pull us and tempt us in all kinds of ways, and can seem alien to us when they do so. They are ours; but we are also theirs.\n\nMoreover, the hunger of the imagination is the source of many negative emotions and dispositions. For the imagination is the root of our capacity to compare ourselves with others, and, when we\n  do so, we often suppose that they have something, or some things, that we do not have. This can give rise to envy, for example, or greed \u2013 emotions unpleasant to have in themselves and also\n  highly likely to lead to various conflicts with others.\n\nThe Vacuity of Life\n\nBecause human beings are so hungry, they experience a kind of emptiness at the centre of their existence \u2013 just as they experience an emptiness in the stomach when they\n  are hungry for food. Johnson called this \u2018the vacuity of life\u2019. Of course, individuals differ in how susceptible they are to such emptiness in psychological terms, and in how they cope\n  with it, but we are all to a greater or lesser extent restless, constantly seeking to fill up our lives. The French philosopher Blaise Pascal famously expressed this by saying that the reason human\n  beings are miserable is that they cannot remain quietly alone in a room. If they try to do this, they grasp acutely the vacuity of life, a sense of themselves as empty containers that cannot bear\n  their own emptiness. Hence we crave distraction all the time. We need to fill up our time. From a very bleak perspective \u2013 Pascal\u2019s, for example \u2013 all human activity is\n  basically a form of distraction, an attempt to rid ourselves of a feeling of emptiness. But even if we do not see things in this way, it can hardly be denied that very many human activities are\n  forms of distraction in Pascal\u2019s sense.\n\nProbably the best example of this self-distraction in the modern age is the use we often make of the technology by which we are surrounded \u2013 television, film, the internet, mobile phones\n  and so on. Despite its usefulness in many contexts, this technology is immensely distracting. It fills up what would otherwise be empty time \u2013 that is, the sense of emptiness we experience\n  \u2013 and then becomes an end in itself. This is just a way of saying that such technologies are immensely addictive. I see this, for example, in the case of my students, who invariably check\n  their mobile phones for messages and calls as soon as the class has finished. Such technology gives them a sense of never being alone, of never having to face their emptiness. But that is certainly\n  in large part an illusion.\n\nIn any case, we distract ourselves in many ways, and it may be that the problems of contemporary societies \u2013 drug and alcohol addiction, gambling, obesity, pornography and so on \u2013\n  are really attempts to fill the vacuity that haunts us.\n\nAnother way of putting this is to say that the world is indifferent to us. To become addicted to something is to seek to wrest something from the world, to make it respond to us, to strip it of\n  its indifference. This is why those who are truly addicted to something feel, when indulging the addiction, that the world is theirs. But, of course, when the moment has passed, they feel\n  even more acutely the indifference of the world \u2013 which feeds the addiction. We are not all addicts. But human beings are deeply addictive creatures. That is one manifestation of their need\n  for distraction to fill themselves up.\n\nWe all of us have to do something with our time, and part of the problem of human life is finding worthy things to do \u2013 things that do not involve the expenditure of energy for\n  its own sake but rather are constructive, or deepening, or nourishing. If you have ever rid yourself of a few hours by surfing the internet without even really realizing that this is what you were\n  doing \u2013 and, at the end, could not much remember what you saw or honestly say that you found anything much worth thinking about \u2013 then you know exactly what I am talking about. And you\n  also know what Pascal was seeking to express in speaking of human beings\u2019 need for distraction.\n\nThe Craving for Novelty\n\nBecause we long to fill ourselves up, psychologically and spiritually, one of the things that haunts the human mind is boredom. Boredom is, at least in one of its forms, an\n  unbearable sense of vacuity; it is the psychological manifestation of the sense of the vacuity of life. And one way in which we seek to evade boredom is by seeking out that which is new. We are\n  afflicted, Johnson noted, by a craving for novelty. The French philosopher Albert Camus said that man can get used to anything. That may be true. But it is also true, and well known, that we can\n  become bored by anything that at the outset we welcomed. In our age, the place where we see this most clearly is the consumerist market, where so much of what is bought is acquired not because what\n  it replaces has worn out or become unusable, but simply because it has become familiar \u2013 in other words, we are bored by it. \u2018Fashion\u2019 is one term by which we dignify this aspect\n  of our lives.\n\nPsychological Mess\n\nWhat all that adds up to is that human beings are deeply conflicted both within themselves and with others. They are psychologically messy in the ways I have sought to describe,\n  and this generates conflict within and without \u2013 that is, intrasubjective and intersubjective conflict. Pained by a sense of emptiness, we inevitably clash with others as we\n  seek the means to assuage our suffering.\n\nI am saying nothing new: it has been said countless times since human beings started to think about the kinds of creatures they are. The great religions took these facts of the human condition\n  deeply seriously, and sought ways in which their adherents might cope with and make sense of their suffering. Buddhism, for example, elaborated techniques of meditation and mindfulness, practices\n  aimed at enabling us to learn to accept and thrive on the emptiness at the centre of human experience. Christianity, whose name for the restless condition I have described is \u2018original\n  sin\u2019, did the same with prayer, which, in its best forms, has a purificatory function, and suggested that human beings can only finally achieve peace in the beatific vision of God after\n  death, intimations of which are, nonetheless, available to us here in this world. One reason why many people in the modern age feel themselves to be spiritually bereft is that they can no longer\n  really believe in the solutions such religions offer \u2013 this is part of what the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche meant by \u2018the death of God\u2019 \u2013 but the needs to which\n  these religions ministered have not gone away.\n\nOntological Misfits\n\nBecause human beings know that they are psychologically messy, they devise techniques to seek to escape their condition as such. They invent ideals, seeking to transcend\n  themselves. Christianity was one of the main such ideals in the West \u2013 and still is, for plenty of people \u2013 yet for many it is now unbelievable. But there are many other ideals:\n  personal, ethical, political, aesthetic and so on. The basic distinction at work in an ideal is between how the world is and how it ought to be. And because we are part of the\n  world, we subject ourselves to the kind of scrutiny in question: we are as we are, but seek to be what we ought to be, however we may conceive that.\n\nBut what this means is that we are seeking to escape our own condition, to transcend ourselves. Hence we can say: it is the nature of human beings to seek to escape their own\n  condition, to long to be something else. This does not mean that all human beings are like this all the time, but it is to say that it is a feature of our fundamental, or ontological, condition:\n  that is the kind of creature we are.\n\nWe are at odds with ourselves, and this is one of the things that distinguishes us from the other animals and why we can sometimes envy them their ability simply to be at home in the world.\n  Traditionally, the view I am exploring has been expressed by saying that human beings are neither beasts nor angels, both of which are at peace with themselves, whilst we are not. We are\n  ontological misfits. We are not at home in the world. And in my view that explains, in large part, why it is that human history is such a relentless, monstrous scene of suffering inflicted\n  by human beings on themselves and each other: we flail around in our own wretched confusions, and as we do so we wound ourselves and those around us. In our attempts to escape our condition, to\n  find something solid on which to rely, to make ourselves the stable thing we need, we seek to dominate ourselves and others, seek to gain control of things, and, in doing this, we invariably make\n  things worse all round.\n\nAll well and good, you might say. If it is the nature of human beings to wish to escape their condition as human beings, and if this generates such adversity, then clearly what we need to do is\n  to stop doing that and to accept ourselves in all our humanity. But that will not work since, obviously enough, to accept one\u2019s nature as a human being just is to accept that it is\n  one\u2019s nature to seek to escape that. So either way is unsatisfactory: if you accept yourself, you will accept your longing to escape your condition, and therefore seek to do so; if you do not\n  accept your condition as a human being then, similarly, you will seek to escape your condition. Either way, you are caught.\n\nAs I say, different individuals manifest these ontological tendencies to different degrees. But no one is wholly free of them. To suppose that would be to suppose that he or she had no sense at\n  all of any way in which things ought to be other than as they are. And there is no one like that. No one thinks that the world is perfect, for only a person with no desires could think that \u2013\n  but that is to be dead.\n\nChance\n\nOne way to express much of what I have been saying is that our lives very largely escape our control and are a matter of chance, not choice. No one chooses to be born, or when\n  and where to be born, or who his or her parents are, or what mother tongue he or she speaks. No one chooses his or her basic psychological proclivities and tendencies, or early formative\n  experiences. Psychological patterns are largely laid down by the time one is old enough to start thinking about them, and seeking to channel or change them. Moreover, much of what happens to us as\n  we pass through life is chance \u2013 it is chance, for example, that we meet particular people, or are subject to specific illnesses or difficulties. And because so much of what we are and what\n  we experience is a matter of chance, we face the world as very weak creatures, exposed in all kinds of ways that can hurt or harm us. That is another way of expressing the point that we are\n  physically, psychologically and ontologically fragile creatures. Indeed, it is probably in various forms of lack of control over our lives that we most acutely sense that fragility.\n\nAdversity\n\nThe German philosopher Martin Heidegger expressed some such thought by saying that we are thrown into the world \u2013 and can never gain a wholly secure foothold. Put\n  more prosaically, our reflections show us that adversity in human life is inevitable and can never be wholly escaped. This does not mean that we cannot devise strategies to reduce it or manage it\n  better. But it does mean that one of the first things you need to do if you want to achieve this is to accept that your life will never be wholly free of adversity. In other words, you have to be\n  realistic. This is not a counsel of despair. Quite the contrary. Being realistic about things is the first step towards changing them, and, even though things can never be wholly as we want them to\n  be, we can certainly improve them.\n\nThis Book\n\nThat is what this book is about. I have explored four areas of life where we often experience adversity, aiming to show how adversity in these aspects of our existence can be\n  dealt with more constructively. The areas I have taken are:\n\n\u2022 The family. I have concentrated here mainly on how things look from the point of view of the child towards parents.\n\n\u2022 Love. Here I have concentrated, amongst the many different forms of love, on romantic love, or eros.\n\n\u2022 Illness. My approach here has been mainly to look at physical, rather than mental, illness.\n\n\u2022 Death. In this chapter I have sought to explore both our fear of dying and our fear of death.\n\nIt will be immediately apparent that I could have chosen different approaches. For example, I might have explored the view parents have of their children, or sibling relations\n  and rivalry. Again, there are aspects of death that I have left aside and not discussed, such as how to cope with the death of a loved one. And so on. But the aim has been to offer one central\n  approach in each case, in the hope that enough detail can be given to provide some real, concrete reflection. Throughout I have drawn on philosophers and other thinkers to explore the topics in\n  question. I have done so for many reasons, but principally because I believe that we can best make sense of our own struggles with adversity by seeing how others have done so in their lives. This\n  is no substitute, of course, for our own reflection and our own attempts to clarify things, but it helps enormously.\n\nSo what I offer here are some suggestions about some aspects of the topics I broach. I aim to open up space for productive thinking on your part. Nothing I say is definitive, and you\n  should test my advice against your own experience, feelings and thinking. But my hope is that, even if you reject some given suggestion I make, by articulating your reasons for disagreeing, you\n  will be able to make better sense of the adversity in your life, thinking more constructively about it, and experiencing that adversity more insightfully.\n\nNo book can hope to have everyone as its intended audience \u2013 a point that Nietzsche made ironically when he subtitled Thus Spoke Zarathustra \u2018a book for everyone and no\n  one\u2019. In the case of this book, my readership is suggested partly by the topics with which it deals, but also by the individuals \u2013 the philosophers and other thinkers \u2013 whose\n  cases I discuss. These range from classical thinkers such as Seneca and Plutarch, to novelists such as Proust and Kafka, to contemporary writers such as John Updike. (I have given the sources of\n  all quotations, and all translations are mine except where indicated). I do not, in general, much care whether a writer is classified as a philosopher or novelist or whatever, if what he or she has\n  to say is worth listening to. We should get help in understanding our lives wherever we can.\n\nI would, nonetheless, describe this as a book in therapeutic philosophy or philosophy as a way of life, because I seek in it to combine a level of reflection at a somewhat\n  abstract level with detailed discussion of concrete cases, in the hope of providing material with which we can think more productively about our lives. This is why each chapter carries a title that\n  points towards both the abstract and the concrete. There is an ancient and noble tradition of philosophy as therapy. This book intends to place itself in such a tradition.\n\nIn my view, philosophy is one of the ways of thinking of the human condition that can help us make better sense of it. People sometimes ask: What is the good of philosophy? What does it do? I\n  would say that one answer is this: We all experience adversity in our life, in different ways and to different degrees. Inevitably we start to think about what sense we can make of this adversity.\n  \u2018Philosophy\u2019 is, in part, just the name for that thinking when it is continued in a certain direction and in a certain style. To that extent, it is simply an extension of ordinary ways\n  of thinking. In this book I hope to give you a few pointers to help extend your thinking in this way. If I have done that, then this book will have achieved its aim.",

      "content": "# 1. Ambivalence; or, Adversity in the Family\n\nOurs is an age deeply committed to the family. We imagine that Western culture is largely built on a conception of the affective family \u2013 the result of two individuals\n  coming together because they love each other and whose love deepens and finds expression in the having of children. We tell ourselves that it is in a stable family that children have the best\n  chance of starting out well in life, and we idealize the image of a couple who stay together through all of life\u2019s vicissitudes. One of our stock conceptions here is of the old couple on the\n  doorstep of their home, waving goodbye to the children and grandchildren after a pleasant Sunday spent together. No politician could openly criticize the family and get away unscathed, and those\n  politicians who are in favour of letting gay couples bring up children or wish to defend the rights of single parents nearly always support their view by saying that these are merely alternative or\n  new forms of the family.\n\nBut the reality, as we all know, is much less tidy than the standard images suggest. The family, much as we want it to be a place of calm and security that nurtures us, is often far from that.\n  It can often be a scene of conflict and even violence, and much that goes on in it can be dreadful and painful, leaving psychological damage for life. We all have to learn to live with this and\n  make something of it, and in this chapter I aim to explore a little how we might do that. I investigate things mainly from the point of view of children in their relationship with their\n  parents.\n\nHappy and Unhappy Families\n\nIn his book Thoughts on Happiness, Alain (\u00c9mile-Auguste Chartier) tells us that there are two kinds of people: those who seek to silence others and those who get\n  used to the noise others make. They each search out their own kind, and for this reason, he says, there are two kinds of family.\n\nThere are some families in which it is tacitly agreed that anything that upsets one member is forbidden to all the others. One person dislikes the smell of flowers, another,\n      loud voices; one insists on silence in the evening, the other in the morning. This person does not want anyone to mention religion, that person finds his teeth set on edge by talk of politics.\n      Each recognizes that they all have a right of \u2018veto\u2019; all avail themselves of this right imperiously . . . This makes for a dreary peace and an irritated happiness.\n\nThere are other families where the whims of each are sacred, loved, and where it never occurs to anyone that his delight could be annoying to the others . . . These are egoists. (Propos\n      sur le bonheur: 83\u20134)\n\nWe all know what Alain is talking about, and we might find a complement to what he says in Tolstoy\u2019s famous first sentence of Anna Karenina: \u2018All happy\n  families resemble one another; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u2019. This could mean many things. One interpretation is that there is little to say about a happy family \u2013 and\n  much to say about an unhappy one. Some confirmation of this is found in Edmund Gosse\u2019s story of his childhood and his relationship with this father. In Father and Son he recalls many\n  of the difficulties of his relationship with his father, who oppressed him with an intolerant and dogmatic religious outlook, but he tells us that on one occasion he spent time with the family of\n  his cousins and was at ease and happy. Yet, he says, he can recall little of what he actually did whilst staying with his relatives:\n\nThis long visit to my cousins . . . must have been very delightful: I am dimly aware that it was: yet I remember but few of its incidents. My memory, so clear and vivid\n      about earlier solitary times, now in all this society becomes blurred and vague . . . [O]f this little happy breathing-space I have nothing to report . . . [Here was] a brief interval of\n      healthy, happy child-life, when my hard-driven soul was allowed to have, for a little while, no history. (Father and Son: 47)\n\nOf course, we do often remember good times, but Gosse\u2019s point alerts us to the fact that usually we are not puzzled by pleasure and happiness, and hence not\n  especially driven to reflection on them, not least because when we are happy we are simply absorbed in what we are doing and the mind meets no resistance whose nature it wishes to fathom, perhaps\n  in order to remove it. We accept happiness when it is there; it does not raise problems for us. Hence, we are not really very good at distinguishing the different kinds of happy family.\n  However, Alain is easily able to distinguish two kinds of unhappy family, and gives us the sense that part of the problem in each case is that of living in an extreme. He shows us that\n  finding peace and contentment in the family \u2013 as elsewhere \u2013 is about learning to be a kind of tightrope walker, balancing acrobatically in such a way that not only does one not fall\n  but one retains one\u2019s balance with grace.\n\nBalancing Acts\n\nIn the first volume of Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time, Marcel, the narrator, describes a scene, a moment, one evening in his young life, that has much to tell us\n  about family life \u2013 and about why achieving that graceful balance is so difficult.\n\nMarcel\u2019s mother is in the habit of coming to his bedroom to say goodnight and give him a kiss. On the evening in question, however, when M. Swann, a friend of Marcel\u2019s parents, is\n  with the family for dinner, Marcel is sent to bed before the adults are to eat, and, just as he is about to kiss his mother, the bell for dinner rings and the opportunity escapes him. Marcel goes\n  up to bed, wretched. He conceives a plan to send down the maid, Fran\u00e7oise, with a note to his mother asking her to come up to see him. He tells Fran\u00e7oise that his mother wanted him to\n  send a message about some object she had asked him to look for \u2013 he does not want to admit the true reason for sending the note. Fran\u00e7oise probably does not believe him, but hands over\n  the message anyway. Marcel\u2019s mother sends back word to him: \u2018There is no reply\u2019. Devastated, Marcel decides to wait up in his room and waylay his mother later when she goes to\n  bed.\n\nThe grace and balance of the tightrope walker have much to teach us about the attitude we should adopt to family relations.\n\nTowards the end of the evening, he hears Swann leaving. Then he hears his mother ascending the stairs. He goes out from his room to meet her. She is astonished to see him \u2013 and angry. He\n  implores her to come and say goodnight to him in his bedroom, but she simply tells him: \u2018Run, run, so that at least your father won\u2019t see you waiting here as if you had gone mad\u2019.\n  Both Marcel and his mother know that Marcel\u2019s father would be highly likely to see the boy\u2019s behaviour as feeble and self-indulgent. But it is too late: Marcel\u2019s father is already\n  on the stairs and sees what is going on. To the surprise of both, however, Marcel\u2019s father, seeing that he is overwrought, tells his wife to go with the boy and to have a bed made up for\n  herself in his room: she should spend the night with him. She objects, not wanting to give in to Marcel\u2019s hypersensitive nature \u2013 both his parents are aware that it is only doubtfully\n  good for him, for his future, that Marcel be so extraordinarily acute about such things. But she has the bed made up.\n\n\u2018I should have been happy: I was not,\u2019 reports Marcel. He goes on:\n\nAs it seemed to me, my mother had just made her first concession to me, which she must have found painful: for the first time she had given up on the ideal that she had\n      devised for me, and it was the first time that she, otherwise so courageous, had had to admit defeat. It seemed to me that, if I had just been victorious, it was over her, that, if I had\n      achieved what only illness, sorrow or age should have achieved \u2013 a loosening of her will, a bending of her judgement \u2013 then this evening was the beginning of an era, would remain as\n      a sad date. (\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu I: Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann: 38)\n\nThere are, I think, two key things that we can learn from this. The first is that Marcel has grasped, fully grasped for the first time, that his mother is someone else, that\n  she has her own life, that the centre of her consciousness is not his. She is the source or centre of all that is good in his life \u2013 the missed goodnight kiss is a synecdoche for that,\n  expresses it in compressed form. But when she withholds herself from him, as she does when she does not come to see him in his bedroom, Marcel realizes that this goodness is not in his control,\n  that it can be withdrawn from him in an instant. It is not just that his mother\u2019s failure to come to see him makes him feel wretched; it is that Marcel understands how intensely fragile is\n  his hold on the things in this world that nourish him.\n\nThe second important thing in this episode is the fact that, when Marcel gets what he wants, he is not happy. He is not happy because when his mother comes to him she seems changed, because he\n  has made her come to him. What he wanted was for her to come to him of her own accord, without any constraint on his part. In gaining his victory over her he has changed her, however\n  subtle that change might be. A chasm thus opens up for Marcel and it separates him from his own desire. We normally think that there is nothing more characteristic of us than the desires we have:\n  my desire to write this book, for example, is in many ways deeply expressive of the person I am \u2013 I can hardly imagine my life without my ever-recurrent desire to read, to reflect, to learn,\n  to write \u2013 and we all have patterns of desire that seem typical of us as individuals. But Marcel is separated from his own desire: he gets what he wants and it makes him unhappy.\n\nSomeone might say, by way of objection: Marcel did not get what he wanted, because he wanted his mother to come to him unchanged. But this is to miss the point about Marcel\u2019s desire. He\n  really did get what he wanted, but he did not really understand what it was that he wanted. Our desires are often like this: we realize, once they are satisfied, what it was that we had actually\n  been wanting all along, because before the satisfaction of the desire we had not understood the price we would have to pay. It was not that we had not really wanted whatever we desired; it was that\n  we had not understood the nature of our own desire. Of course, this is not to deny that one can satisfy a desire and then realize that one did not really want whatever it was at all. But\n  Marcel\u2019s case is of the more subtle variety already described.\n\nAmbivalent Feelings\n\nMarcel discovers that the experience of desire is always implicitly or potentially traumatic. In particular, he discovers that his desire for his mother is traumatic.\n  Melanie Klein, the psychoanalyst, might put the point in terms of ambivalence: what Marcel discovers is that he can feel hostile towards that which is the source of goodness \u2013 his\n  mother \u2013 precisely because that source can be withheld from him. He has to learn to bear the independence from him of that which is good in life, and he has to learn to bear the ambivalence\n  of his feelings about that source. For Klein, being grown up is in large part about being able to negotiate those feelings of ambivalence engendered by the very recognition in question.\n\nPart of Marcel\u2019s problem, of course, is that he comes to see his mother as limited. According to Sigmund Freud, in his short but very powerful essay \u2018Family Romances\u2019,\n  and in a series of thoughts echoed in the work of Klein, this is one of the most deeply painful moments in life. The child starts out, he says, believing his parents to be \u2018his only authority\n  and the source of all he believes in. However,\u2019 Freud goes on,\n\nas the child develops intellectually he cannot help gradually getting to know the category to which his parents belong. He gets to know other parents, compares them with his\n      own, and so becomes entitled to doubt the incomparable and unique status once attributed to them. Small events in the child\u2019s life which induce in him a mood of dissatisfaction provide\n      him with an occasion to start criticizing his parents, and the knowledge he now has, that other parents are in many respects to be preferred, allows him to support this attitude . . . The\n      reason for such a reaction is obviously the feeling of being slighted. There are all too many occasions when a child is slighted, or at least feels that he has been slighted, and that he does\n      not completely have his parents\u2019 love . . . (\u2018Der Familienroman der Neurotiker\u2019: 227\u20138)\n\nThe description fits Marcel perfectly.\n\nEven if we do not accept all the details of their respective accounts, between them Freud and Klein put their finger on an important truth: we are pretty much all like Marcel. That is, whilst\n  there may be some exceptions, in the main we all want our mother \u2013 or, more generally, our parents, and siblings if we have them; in short, our family \u2013 to give us the kind of love and\n  goodness that Marcel felt so agonizingly present in that withheld goodnight kiss. The inevitable failure of our parents and siblings to give us this can make the family a scene of trouble and pain,\n  even though it can be a place of warmth and security.\n\nAnd the failure is indeed inevitable, since, as George Eliot puts it, \u2018[w]e are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves\u2019\n  (Middlemarch: 243). The family is the first place where we grasp the independence of those around us. As we learn that they give us what is good but can also withdraw that goodness at any\n  time \u2013 by choice or otherwise \u2013 we also learn that we are not the centre of the world, that the self must accept privation as central to its existence. The family, which seems to\n  promise so much, indeed the denial of that truth, becomes the place where it is played out.\n\nIdiots and Jesters\n\nThe truth to which these reflections point is that we never grow up. We are always potentially capable of slipping back into the mode of behaviour of the child who stamps his\n  feet in anger and frustration because he does not get what he wants from his parents.\n\nI was reminded of this recently when I saw a bickering couple at a railway station, on the opposite platform. Shouting at each other, they were evidently extremely angry with each other, and\n  then she walked away from him, down the platform: \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn about you!\u2019 was her message. He trailed after her, yelling at her all the while. I remembered times when, as\n  a child, I would walk away from my mother in this way, damning her and yet needing her to follow after me, and I saw in this couple the repetition of a child\u2019s reaction to his or her parent.\n  And we have all, in various ways, been one member of that couple, walking off or standing watching as the other departs, aware of the idiocy of what we are doing and yet seemingly incapable of\n  stopping ourselves from doing it. Perhaps that is the key point: we should never forget our own idiocy.\n\nWe should remember how absurd we are, because by doing so we might better be able to manage those moments in which we regress to the condition of children. We should try to laugh at our own\n  idiocies \u2013 that might well diffuse those situations in which, like the couple at the station, we spoil things for ourselves and others and achieve nothing. We always secretly believe that we\n  are the tragic hero of our own conflicts. But think of yourself as a jester instead. Then you might find that you achieve a better balance between what you want from another person and what you\n  actually get from him or her.\n\nHeading off Guilt\n\nThose who are moved to write of their parents often express a deep sense of loss, of pain \u2013 of what Franz Kafka, in his unsent Letter to my Father\n  (recently translated under the title Dearest Father), called being \u2018inwardly wounded\u2019. Kafka uses the phrase in the context of an account of a moment \u2018from his earliest\n  years\u2019. He writes:\n\nThinking of yourself like this will probably help you reduce adversity in your life.\n\nI was moaning continually in the night for water, certainly not because I was thirsty, but probably partly in order to irritate, partly for pleasure. After you had issued\n      several threats, but to no avail, you took me out of bed and carried me onto the veranda and left me standing there alone for a while in my shirt in front of the closed door. I do not say that\n      that was wrong; perhaps it was at that moment the only way to get some peace in the night. But I do mean by recalling this to describe your way of bringing me up and its effect on me.\n      Afterwards, I was, indeed, at that time very obedient, but it left me inwardly wounded. Given my nature I could never reconcile the normality of my pointless crying for water with the\n      extraordinary terribleness of being carried outside. Years later I still suffered from the tormenting idea that the huge man, my father, the highest authority, could, for almost any reason,\n      come in the night and carry me from my bed onto the veranda \u2013 and that I was thus nothing to him. (Brief an den Vater: 10)\n\nKafka\u2019s father, Hermann Kafka, was a physically massive man, and he had a dominating temperament to match. The highly sensitive boy was spiritually crushed by the\n  bullying ways of his father \u2013 Kafka\u2019s letter is a painful record of incidents of the kind quoted here. Yet what is so extraordinary is that Kafka is at pains to be just to his father\n  \u2013 witness his almost exaggerated insistence that what his father did when the boy was crying in the night was perhaps not wrong. This is part of his general strategy in the letter \u2013 in\n  his life \u2013 to come to terms with his father.\n\nKafka describes how he believes his father sees their relationship, and he lists the things he himself has done or failed to do, or aspects of his personality, that, he is sure, must have\n  disappointed, frustrated or angered his father. He is sure that his father sees him as cold, distant and ungrateful. Moreover, he writes, his father thinks of this as Kafka\u2019s fault \u2013 he\n  is the guilty one. Kafka continues:\n\nI am so convinced that this, your usual view of things, is correct that I also believe you to be wholly innocent as far as our estrangement is concerned. But I too am just\n      as wholly innocent. If I could only get you to acknowledge that then \u2013 I shall not say a new life, since we are both too old for that \u2013 but a kind of peace would be possible; not an\n      end to your reproaches but yet a softening of them. (Brief an den Vater: 6)\n\nLater he adds: \u2018I do not believe in the least that there was guilt on your part. Your effect on me was the effect that you inevitably had\u2019 (Brief an den\n  Vater: 8).\n\nAbove all, Kafka aims to absolve both himself and his father of guilt. And he wishes to do this by making his father see that what happened between them was inevitable given the nature \u2013\n  the differing nature \u2013 of their respective personalities.\n\nChemical Reactions\n\nThere is an idea implicit in the work of the Jewish-Italian writer Primo Levi which helps us see the issue more clearly, and understand why Kafka\u2019s approach is so\n  productive.\n\nLevi was a chemist who was incarcerated in Auschwitz from February 1944 until January 1945. In many ways, he owed his survival to his having been a chemist. The most obvious way in which this\n  was so was that he was put to work in the camp laboratory \u2013 the Nazis exploited his knowledge \u2013 and this meant that he had shelter from some of the harshest work and weather conditions.\n  But the second, more subtle, benefit for him was perhaps just as important.\n\nBecause he was a chemist, Levi was used to experimenting with elements and compounds and observing how they react with each other. In one of those leaps of the imagination which is so obvious\n  that it is missed by virtually everyone else, Levi applied this way of thinking to his fellow prisoners and thence to the camp as a whole. He saw it as a kind of massive experiment designed to test\n  how different individuals would react when put in the particular conditions of the camp, recognizing that it can be extremely helpful to think of individual human beings as resembling chemical\n  elements, with their own peculiar properties. Each reacts in a certain kind of way with other such elements, depending also on their respective properties.\n\nSo, just as, say, potassium reacts violently when exposed to air or to water, and therefore has to be stored under conditions which isolate it from such, we might think of human beings as\n  inevitably reacting in specific ways, depending on their nature, when exposed to other individuals (or situations, for that matter).\n\nWhen Kafka says of his father that his effect on him was the effect that he inevitably had, we might see him as expressing the same perspective on human beings as that offered by Levi \u2013\n  that is, that they are like chemical elements. Indeed, Kafka invites us into thinking in this way, since he sees both himself and his sisters in what we might call material or\n  corporeal terms \u2013 as a mixture of matter or stuff derived from their father, Hermann Kafka, and mother, Julie L\u00f6wy. For example, he, Franz, is \u2018a L\u00f6wy with a certain\n  Kafka foundation\u2019 whilst his sister Valli has \u2018little Kafka material in her\u2019. Hermann Kafka was a self-made businessman who had dragged himself out of a life of deprivation and\n  poverty, someone who, as Hugo Bergmann, a friend of Kafka\u2019s, said, \u2018stood with both feet in his physical reality, in his business\u2019. He was, as Kafka himself said, someone who\n  valued \u2018strength, health, appetite, a powerful voice, eloquence, self-confidence, superiority over the world, stamina, presence of mind, knowledge of human beings\u2019 (Brief an den\n  Vater: 7; 30; 71; 7). He was, in short, pretty much everything that Kafka was not, for Kafka himself was physically frail, emotionally and intellectually highly sensitive, cautious, timid,\n  questioning and sceptical, and deeply unsure of himself. No wonder that two chemical elements of such differing natures would lead to an explosive reaction.\n\nThe immense value of looking at things this way is that it does much to cut the ground away from feelings of guilt. It makes no sense to blame a chemical for reacting as it does with another; it\n  just does what it does. If we look at human beings in this way, we can also, perhaps, learn better to accept them for what they are, seeing the way they react as just a function of their individual\n  nature. This is what Kafka is doing with his father. If it really was inevitable that he have a certain effect on his son, given their respective natures, it would make no sense blaming either of\n  them for the situation, or for either of them to feel guilty.\n\nChemistry has some important things to teach us about interpersonal relations.\n\nOf course, there are circumstances in which this model does not apply. It might be useless, for example, if we are thinking about the criminal justice system, where questions of guilt and\n  responsibility have a much more impersonal aspect than they do in intimate family relationships. But, within the intimacy of the family, I think that this way of thinking can be very helpful. After\n  all, individuals\u2019 characters do seem largely fixed, and we have already discussed how the character a person has is largely a matter of chance \u2013 of what he or she is born with by way of\n  natural talents, aptitudes and proclivities, as well as of the influence of external events. If, as Kafka did, one can look at those in the family by whom one feels let down \u2013 or from whom\n  one would like so much more \u2013 as doing nothing more than acting from their nature, reacting to the world as their nature leads them to, then we might be able to feel less disappointed or want\n  less from them, because we see them as simply being unable to give more. And that would be an improvement, perhaps a move towards more peaceful relations. Kafka sees the impossibility of changing\n  his father, indeed the absurdity of trying to change him: he is what he is, and that is that. The best thing is simply to accept him as he is.\n\nOf course, it is extremely difficult to accept others in this way. But it might help to reflect on how difficult it is to change oneself. Granted that it is hard to change oneself, the\n  idea of changing another person becomes clear in all its absurdity. It is, of course, true that one can change oneself, at least in some ways and to some degree, but it is also true that this takes\n  a lot of hard work and cannot be achieved instantaneously. Given that this is the case, you can see that it does not make much sense trying to change others. They may not even want to be changed!\n  In such a case, what you need to do is to try to accept them as they are. As I say, this is very difficult to do, but it is something in your hands, whereas their changing is not, and so, to that\n  extent, is a sensible thing to seek to do.\n\nGetting Out of the Way\n\nBut, of course, Kafka also wanted his father to look at things as he did \u2013 to cease wanting him, Kafka, to change. And whether he was capable of that would be, from the\n  present perspective, a matter of whether he happened to be the kind of chemical element that possessed the sort of flexibility required. He did not. What does one do in such a situation? One\n  possibility is suggested by Dorothy Rowe in her book on depression, when she speaks about her sister. Rowe says that contact with her sister always sets her thinking about her childhood in such a\n  way as to leave her feeling miserable because it brings back to her the fact that \u2018every day is a struggle against the effects of a chronic illness which was a result of childhood\n  neglect\u2019 (Depression: the Way Out of Your Prison: 96). Hence, she tries to reduce the impact that her sister has on her by reducing contact with her. Rowe, borrowing a notion from\n  Buddhist practice, sees this as a form of detachment, which she understands as a species of forgiveness \u2013 though different, of course, from the forgiveness so often (usually unrealistically)\n  idealized as involving feelings of positive warmth for the person who has hurt us.\n\nIn my view, Rowe\u2019s approach is deeply humane and honest. If it is impossible to avoid being hurt by someone, then the best thing is simply to reduce contact with that person. It seems so\n  obvious, but it is hard, because families tend to be very demanding of one\u2019s presence. There are all kinds of cultural, social and psychological pressures that demand of us that we get on\n  well with our family \u2013 and the family itself can apply those pressures on us, just as we can apply them on ourselves. But if, as in the case Rowe discusses, there is someone in the family who\n  keeps hurting us, and if we honestly think we can do nothing on either side to change that, then reducing or severing contact might well be the best option. No one could think it good; it is a\n  matter of making the best of a bad job. But then, \u2018the best of a bad job is all we ever make of it\u2019, as Harcourt-Reilly, a character in one of T. S. Eliot\u2019s plays, remarks\n  (The Cocktail Party: 124).\n\nMaking Something of It\n\nKafka did not resolve his problems with his father. His letter was never sent, and we do not know what its impact on Hermann Kafka would have been anyway. Probably\n  incomprehension. But what is clear is that Kafka felt that he had been damaged permanently by the way he had been brought up by his father. He tells us in his letter that he sought desperately to\n  escape from his father\u2019s influence but could not. For example, his several attempts to marry failed, and he felt that they did so because of his father: his father\u2019s effect on him\n  caused him to sabotage the engagements himself. To marry, he says, would have meant becoming equal to his father as head of his own household. But this parity would have meant that he, Kafka, would\n  have become a \u2018free, grateful, innocent, decent son\u2019 and his father \u2018an unvexed, nontyrannical, compassionate, satisfied father\u2019. But, he says, for that to have happened\n  \u2018everything that had happened would have to be undone, i.e., we ourselves cancelled out\u2019 (Brief an den Vater: 55). And that, of course, was impossible.\n\nThis sense of having been permanently damaged by one\u2019s parents is very common. In his autobiographical novel Leavetaking, Peter Weiss tells us that in his family \u2018[w]hen we\n  spoke about life we had to be mournful and burdened. Life meant seriousness, effort, responsibility\u2019 (Abschied von den Eltern: 57). He tells of the effect on him when, twice in his\n  childhood, he met a friend of his parents, Fritz W, whose attitude to life was wholly different. In his presence Weiss felt liberated, relieved, light-hearted. The two meetings with Fritz W, he\n  says,\n\nthe high points of my childhood, show me how differently my life, under other circumstances, could have developed, and they show me the treasure of unused joy which was in\n      me, and still is within me, under the layers of sores. (Abschied von den Eltern: 50)\n\nOr, in Italo Svevo\u2019s blackly humorous novel Zeno\u2019s Conscience, at the end of the chapter on his father\u2019s death, Zeno tells how his father stood up\n  from his death bed and struck him on the cheek before dropping dead to the floor. The meaning of this gesture haunts Zeno for the rest of his life: was it merely a rebuke to him because he had\n  tried to keep his father in bed as the doctor ordered? More likely it is a rebuke because \u2018[w]e had so little in common that he confessed to me that, of all the people who disturbed him the\n  most in this world, I was at the top of the list\u2019. And: \u2018Many times, when I think about it, I am amazed by the strangeness of the fact that this desperation concerning myself and my\n  future made its first appearance on the death of my father and not before\u2019 (La coscienza di Zeno: 28; 27). Like Kafka, like Weiss, he was wounded for life.\n\nBut there is something that Kafka, Weiss and Zeno can teach us, for they channelled their pain into something creative and thus made it more bearable than it otherwise might have been. All well\n  and good, you might think, but not all of us can turn our pain into something creative. In one sense that is true: we cannot all be a great writer like Kafka, and that is just the way it is.\n  Nonetheless, if you feel hurt in the way Kafka did, then you can write: you can write down your thoughts, your feelings, in the form of a diary, or as a letter \u2013 it need never be sent; that\n  is not the point \u2013 to the person who has hurt you. It is extraordinary how helpful this is. It is not a matter of publishing anything, or even sharing the content with anyone. It is a matter\n  of externalizing your thoughts and feelings, of externalizing yourself, a process which allows you to gain some distance on yourself and your life. There is something about\n  putting your experiences into the form, the pattern, of writing that structures things and makes them better or more bearable. You might also write the response to your letter, on the part\n  of the person who has hurt you, imagining how he or she might reply. Kafka sought hard to see how things might look from the perspective of his father, because this, too, helped to place and\n  structure his own experience in a just perspective. You can do what Kafka did.\n\nCommunication Problems\n\nWhatever else we say about Kafka\u2019s relationship with his father, however, it is clear that Hermann Kafka never made any serious effort to communicate with him. But what\n  can be so painful in the family is that often the will to communicate and open up to another family member is deep and real, and yet somehow is thwarted. This was the situation in the case of\n  Weiss, who speaks of his father\u2019s attitude to his children, whom\n\nhe always avoided, and with whom he could never speak, but when he was away from home he could perhaps feel tenderness for his children, and longing for them, and he always\n      carried pictures of them with him, and he certainly looked at these worn, crumpled pictures in the evening in the hotel room when he was travelling, and he certainly believed that when he\n      returned there would be trust, but when he came back there was always only disappointment and mutual understanding was impossible. (Abschied von den Eltern: 9)\n\nWeiss articulates one of the ways in which human beings can find themselves awkward, inhibited and constrained with each other, even though there is no obvious reason why this\n  should be so. This fact about our condition reminds us how little we understand ourselves. It is no surprise that greed, envy, anger and fear lead to the collapse of relationships; it is much more\n  of a surprise that such collapse can be attendant on relationships where there is good will on both sides. This often happens in families, as Weiss reminds us, because we do usually want family\n  relationships to work. The blood tie counts for a great deal. It is hard for many people to shake off the idea that they ought to be able to get on well with their family because they are bound to\n  them by blood, something that is, in this context, deeply mysterious, physical and yet spiritual.\n\nThis sense of mystery is well brought out by Gabriel Josipovici in his novel Contre-Jour, an imaginary reconstruction of the relationship between the artist Pierre Bonnard and his wife,\n  Marthe, through the eyes of the daughter they never had. The first part of the novel is a long monologue by the daughter, now an adult and living on her own, addressed to the mother. Speaking of a\n  visit she paid to her parents, she says that she always had a sense that she had no place in the family, was hardly even noticed by her mother and father, who were closed in on themselves, and\n  simply did not know what they could do with her. And because she felt so excluded, she clung on even more tightly. However,\n\n[p]erhaps it wasn\u2019t really like that . . . Perhaps it was always only my fault. Perhaps I merely overreacted to a common complaint, to . . . a fact of life . . . I\n      don\u2019t know. We act and then we try to interpret those acts, but the interpretations are only further acts, which themselves call out for later interpretation. (Contre-Jour:\n      42\u20133)\n\nWhat Josipovici captures so well is the sense that we often do not know what we are doing, that our thoughts and emotions seem so deeply elusive when we reflect on them, even\n  if, at the time we act on them, they seem so clear to us. It is as if we lived in two worlds, one on the surface, where we can explain what we are doing \u2013 visiting parents, seeking to\n  establish a harmonious relationship, or whatever \u2013 and another, deeper world, where we do not really know what we are doing or why we are doing it, because we do not understand the\n  deeper springs of thought and action which motivate us to do what we are doing. The meaning of it all escapes us \u2013 which can make only all the deeper the need we might have for connection\n  with, for example, our parents.\n\nHolding Onto That Which is Difficult\n\nWe can turn this mystery to our advantage. In his Letters to a Young Poet, R. M. Rilke says that \u2018things are not all so comprehensible and expressible as people\n  usually want us to believe; most happenings are inexpressible, take place in a region where no word has ever ventured\u2019 (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 13). He uses this as his\n  leading thought in responding to the questions and worries of his young correspondent, Franz Kappus.\n\nKappus wanted advice about some of his poems that he had sent to Rilke, but it turns out that he was also, and perhaps primarily, seeking advice about his life and, in particular, about his deep\n  feeling of loneliness. What Rilke encourages him to do is not to fight his feelings of dissatisfaction:\n\nI would like to ask you, . . . to the extent that I can, to try to have patience with all the unresolved things in your heart, to love the questions themselves as\n      if they were locked rooms and books written in a very strange language. Do not strive for answers which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them. And it really is a\n      matter of living everything. Live your questions now. (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 30\u20131)\n\nRilke sees Kappus\u2019s loneliness as being immensely fruitful, because it gives him an opportunity to find himself.\n\nPeople have (with the help of conventions) made everything easy for themselves, have found the easiest side of that which is easy. But it is clear that we must hold onto\n      that which is difficult. All that lives holds onto that, everything in nature grows and defends itself in its own way and is its own for itself, seeks to be itself at all cost and against all\n      resistance. We know little, but that we must hold onto that which is difficult is a certainty that will not leave us. It is good to be lonely, for loneliness is difficult. (Briefe an einen\n      jungen Dichter: 49)\n\nCrucially, he recommends that Kappus look at things as a child does:\n\nTo go into yourself and for hours meet no one \u2013 that is what one must be able to achieve. To be lonely as one was as a child when the adults went around involved with\n      things that seemed great and important because the grown-ups seemed so occupied and because one understood nothing of what they were doing. (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 42)\n\nRilke sees such a state, in which the activities of people seem odd or strange, as they do to his imagined child, as profoundly positive. For it allows a kind of\n  detachment.\n\nLove and the Spectacle of the World\n\nWe can apply this to family relationships. If we are frustrated or angry with those in our family who do not give us what we want and need, we are likely to feel lonely. We\n  naturally seek to rid ourselves of these negative feelings by trying to get what we want. But if we allow the loneliness in question to live in us, Rilke suggests, instead of fighting to disburden\n  ourselves of it, we realize that we are closer to finding some peace of soul. This is because the frustration and anger attach us all the more to the condition from which we are seeking\n  release. In other words, accepting the loneliness that is the other side of the frustration and anger in question can lead to the dissipation of these negative emotions. What we must do, Rilke\n  suggests, is cultivate the loneliness of the child, in which one does not understand. That is, we must accept the mystery of our inability to get from others what we would like; we must\n  make the mystery of family relations something we live, as Rilke puts it, not something that we seek to be rid of. Hence he writes to Kappus:\n\nAvoid adding to the drama that is always stretched out between parents and children; it uses up too much energy and wastes the love of elders, which has an effect, and is\n      warming, even when it does not understand. Do not ask for advice from them and assume that you will not be understood. But believe in a love that is kept for you like an inheritance and trust\n      that in this love there is an energy and a blessing from which you do not have to escape in order to go very far! (Briefe an einen jungen Dichter: 35\u20136)\n\nYou might think that what Rilke is advising, however difficult, at least makes sense if love is there. But what if it is not? I think that, though this question is\n  understandable, it misses the point Rilke wants to make. The love in question may not be a love that parents have for their children. When Rilke asks us to believe in a love that is like an\n  inheritance I think he is asking us to believe in a love that we can cultivate by accepting loneliness and the mystery of family relations, and living our questions. This is why\n  he counsels Kappus again and again to pay attention to the things of this world \u2013 the night sky, the wind, the trees, the animals. Here, he says, is a source of closeness to things,\n  of love of the things of this world.\n\nHis point is that if the world offers these things to us and is worth loving, then it is our parents who gave us the possibility of responding to the world in this way in the first place. That\n  is their inheritance of love to us. We may never have the relationship we want with them. We may even, as Dorothy Rowe suggested, have to reduce contact with them or break it off altogether. But\n  Rilke would say that this is a way of living our questions; he would remind us that we have inherited life itself, which is an inheritance of love. And, of course, to love in that way can\n  itself lead us away from frustration and anger.\n\nNo one can say for another whether he or she might be able to find things good in the way Rilke suggests is possible. What we make of his thoughts lies in our hands, and with the expanses and\n  limitations of our own character. But I would say: you should try to do what Rilke suggests. Try to open your eyes to the endless extraordinary sights of the natural world; we go round most of the\n  time in a kind of routine, dazed as to what is there. But the plants, trees, animals, sky, sea, and so on are there to be seen, marvellous in their utter gratuity. If we open our eyes, we might be\n  able to be consoled for the pain we carry within us. And if we are consoled in this way, we may be reconciled to the sense of disappointment or loss or hurt we might have concerning our parents.\n  They, after all, gave us this life. It is thanks to them that we can marvel at the world at all.",

      "content": "# 2. Incomprehension; or, Adversity in Love\n\nWe are obsessed with love. Everyone is searching for it or thinking about it. Or so it seems, to judge by the number of advertisements for internet dating websites on trains,\n  buses and the London underground, and by the number of such sites themselves: there may be as many as 8,000 online dating services worldwide, and there are even specialist web-dating sites for\n  Christians, for Oxbridge graduates, for Herpes sufferers, for those who especially love pet animals and for those who want to date using mobile devices (\u2018No-frills Mobile Dating that\u2019s\n  super safe and actually works on every mobile phone, smartphones and dumbphones alike\u2019; \u2018love is in your handsTM\u2019). There are also sites for those\n  with military interests or who like wearing uniforms, for hippies, for vegetarians, for those who consider themselves ugly (\u2018dating for the aesthetically average\u2019), for fans of Star\n  Trek and all things science-fiction, for chavs, for geeks, goths and greens . . . the list goes on. There is also the seemingly endless supply of contemporary films and novels that celebrate\n  romantic love; our contemporary idea that the principal motive for marriage is, or should be, love and that any other reason for marrying \u2013 say, financial security \u2013 is rather ignoble;\n  our endless interest in the tittle-tattle that surrounds the love life of celebrities and our suspicion that, even in their miseries, they are getting something out of love we are not and would\n  like to have; and so on.\n\nIt is evident that we see something in romantic love \u2013 and it is romantic love I want to discuss in this chapter \u2013 that suggests to us the promise of something deeply important and\n  almost irresistible. But we all know that that promise is often disappointed: divorce rates are rocketing, pre-nuptial agreements suggest that we know we are likely to be let down, and we are all\n  familiar with the agonies of the loss of the one we love, or unrequited love, or just the sensation that the person we love is quite different from the person we thought he or she was. What is it\n  that we are looking for in love? And how can we make better sense of love\u2019s disappointments and the conflicts that it so often brings with it?\n\nFalling in Love\n\nSince at least the time of Socrates and Plato in the fifth and fourth century BC, romantic love has been identified as a form of madness or intoxication.\n  The deity of romantic love was Eros, and it is therefore also often referred to as eros. In the nineteenth century, Stendhal repeated the same idea, speaking in his book Love of \u2018the\n  madness known as love, a madness which . . . provides man with the greatest pleasures that are given to beings of his species to taste on earth\u2019 (De l\u2019amour, 39). There is no\n  doubt that this madness or intoxication is central to romantic love. For most of us in the modern bureaucratized world \u2013 the \u2018administered world\u2019 as Theodor Adorno put it \u2013\n  life occurs within massive organized structures that we do not fully understand and even less control \u2013 I mean, principally, the workplace. Moreover, as the sociologist Max Weber made clear,\n  we in the modern West live in a world that is largely disenchanted: the ancient gods have left us, and the Christian God is dead for many of us, as Nietzsche famously said. Ours is a flattened\n  world, in which mystery has been replaced by scientific explanation, and nature\u2019s meaningfulness has been ousted by the blind forces of evolutionary biology. Hence our deep attraction to the\n  intoxication of love.\n\nFor in this intoxication we suddenly have a sense of something so much deeper and more real than our ordinary world with its tiresome duties, commitments and responsibilities, and with its\n  prosaic flatness. The sense of abandon, of letting go, that accompanies romantic love stands in such a sharp contrast to our quotidian activities, and provides such a sense of release from them,\n  that it is no wonder that we are seemingly irresistibly drawn to eros. Indeed, eros is really Eros: he is the only god many of us have left, and divinizes a world in which it is otherwise difficult\n  to find meaning. Of course, this experience of eros is not new to us, as my reference to Socrates and Plato makes clear, but it has a special meaning for us in modernity.\n\nEros, then, is a kind of escape. But it is also a kind of escape that enables us to feel at home in the world. That was what the old religions did; they gave us a sense that this world is our\n  home, that we can find our meaning here, even if that meaning eventually led outside the world to the kingdom of God. The experience of romantic love, precisely because it makes not simply the\n  beloved person but everything lovely to behold, is an experience that seems to give us a sense of homecoming, of finally being at peace with the world.\n\nThe Legacy of Christianity\n\nMany of our thoughts about love come from Christianity. Crucial are the ideas that love is utterly unconditional, eternal and wholly unselfish, as Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians\n  13: 5\u20137: \u2018Charity [i.e., love] . . . seeketh not her own . . . beareth all things . . . never faileth\u2019. Paul was talking about a kind of love other than the romantic variety, but\n  we often fantasize that his sentiments apply to eros. We suppose that in romantic love we fully see the reality of the beloved and are wholly concerned about his or her welfare \u2013 in other\n  words, we are generous, kind, tolerant and patient.\n\nWhat this means is that we are able to combine the intense intoxication of romantic love with a belief what we are experiencing is wholly admirable, since it is perfectly selfless. It seems too\n  good to be true: in romantic love we feel ourselves to be inebriated, our life to be irradiated with meaning, the world to be filled with loveliness and that we are wholly selfless.\n\nCrystallization\n\nIt is too good to be true. And if you want to avoid some of the disappointments of love, you should be as coolly realistic about what eros is as it is possible to\n  be.\n\nIn Love, Stendhal sought to understand, and at the same time overcome, his unrequited love for Mathilde Dembowski. He had met and fallen in love with her in 1818, but she never returned\n  his love, and the more insistent he became the further she retreated from him. In his book, he formulated one of the most acute insights into the nature of romantic love. He called it the process\n  of crystallization. If you love a woman, Stendhal writes,\n\nyou take pleasure in endowing her with a thousand perfections . . . In the end you overrate her as utterly magnificent, as something fallen from Heaven, whom you do not know\n      but is sure to be yours.\n\nIf you leave a lover with his thoughts for twenty-four hours, this is what you will find:\n\nAt the salt mines of Salzburg, they throw a small leafless wintry branch into the depths of the abandoned excavation. Two or three months later they pull it out covered with a shining\n      deposit of crystals. The smallest twigs, no bigger than the claw of a titmouse, are studded with an infinity of dazzling and shimmering diamonds. The original branch can no longer be\n      recognized.\n\nWhat I call crystallization is a process of the mind which draws from everything that occurs new proofs that the loved one is perfect. (De l\u2019amour: 34\u20135)\n\nStendhal thinks, furthermore, that what he calls a second crystallization occurs, in which the process of attributing perfections to the beloved is deepened by any\n  doubts the lover may have about whether he is loved in return. In order to allay his doubts, he searches for evidence that she loves him and, when he finds this evidence, \u2018crystallization\n  begins to reveal new charms\u2019 in the beloved. And although the whole process of crystallization may have started with a sense of the beauty of the loved one, the \u2018lover will soon come to\n  find his mistress beautiful just as she is, without thinking about her real beauty.\u2019 (De l\u2019amour: 36; 52)\n\nObviously enough, Stendhal is articulating the importance of imagination in the whole process of love. Crystallization is only one example of this. Other examples include the role the\n  imagination plays in making another person appeal to us not because of any intrinsic qualities he or she possesses, but rather on account of, say, the context in which we meet this person, or some\n  other attribute, such as fame, for instance. It is well-known, for example, that perfectly average-looking people can seem wildly appealing, even beautiful, on account of the material goods they\n  own or their profession. In such cases, the imagination is excited by the trappings surrounding a person, rather than anything about what he or she is really like, and, so to speak, the imagination\n  mistakes the person, investing him or her with the glow of these trappings. Indeed it is extremely likely that there would be no such thing as romantic love without a large contribution from the\n  imagination, which invests in the beloved a tangled mass of hopes, longings, desires, needs and fears which may have little to do with the person in question. And the difficulty is not so much that\n  the imagination plays a role in romantic love as that it can blind one to what is going on. Stendhal comments:\n\nFrom the moment he is in love, the wisest man no longer sees anything as it really is. He underrates his own qualities, and overrates the least favours granted by\n      his beloved. Hopes and fears at once become romantic and wayward. (De l\u2019amour: 55)\n\nOften we are attracted to others, not so much on account of what they are, but because the things they own or have make them seem extraordinarily appealing.\n\nThe word \u2018wayward\u2019 is in English in Stendhal\u2019s original French text, which heightens the strangeness of his description of what is happening to the lover. In\n  any case, there is a lesson in all this for those disappointed in love, or for those who have to suffer unrequited love. Stendhal is offering a kind of therapy applied to romantic love. The aim is\n  not to stop us ever feeling it \u2013 it would be absurd to embark on such a project anyway \u2013 but to enable us to cope better with its disappointments. He says: if your love for another is\n  unrequited or is full of pain, then remember that, especially in its early stages, it is a kind of madness, something that at least partially blinds you both to the nature of your beloved and to\n  your own condition. If you can do this, you might, with luck, be able to gain a certain kind of distance from it.\n\nAnother way of coping with disappointment in love is to make the pain part of your deeper understanding of life. I have a friend who went through a period in which he had more than his fair\n  share of unsuccessful love affairs. He often felt wretched and miserable. But gradually I understood that there was something willed by him in his various liaisons, because he knew that by\n  embarking upon them he was feeding his curiosity about the human scene. There was a way in which he wanted to affirm all things, good and bad, and these relationships were one route to that.\n  Jean-Paul Sartre was like this too. He wrote in his war diaries:\n\nIt seems to me that, at this moment, I am grasping myself in my most essential structure: in this kind of desolate greed to see myself feel and suffer . . . in order to know\n      all \u2018natures\u2019 \u2013 suffering, pleasure, being-in-the-world. It is precisely me, this continuous, introspective reduplication; this avid haste to put myself to good use;\n      this scrutiny. I know it \u2013 and often I\u2019m weary of it. That\u2019s the source of the magical attraction dark, drowning women have for me. (The War Diaries: November\n      1939\u2013March 1940: 62)\n\nThere is something deeply admirable about such a stance. For sure, you have to be pretty stoical to see things this way, and you will run the risk of destruction if you live\n  like this, but if you can see unrequited love or disappointment in love as a window onto the varieties of human experience, and to that extent as something to be welcomed, you will certainly learn\n  something valuable about yourself and about life, and that itself will help make sense of the pain.\n\nGetting Real\n\nStendhal is not, in any case, a cynic, despite his talk of madness. He is not denying that romantic love is valuable or claiming that such love does not really exist. As we have\n  seen, he thinks that it is our greatest pleasure. But he is being realistic, and he does think that we can help ourselves by ridding ourselves of some of the illusions we have about love,\n  amongst them those we have recovered from Christianity.\n\nChoices, Choices\n\nOne of the central illusions from which we suffer in love is to suppose that we choose our beloved. We often contrast this with family relationships: you cannot choose your family, we think, but\n  you can choose your friends and those you love. It is partly because we think this that we can often suffer from very unproductive guilt when things go wrong in a romantic relationship. \u2018If I\n  have chosen to be with this person,\u2019 so the thought goes, \u2018I really ought to be able to make it work, and if I cannot, if we cannot, then it is right to feel guilt and shame.\u2019 In\n  one way or another, implicitly or explicitly, such thoughts often haunt those who have to live with the consequences of a failed romantic relationship.\n\nBut I think that it is largely an illusion that we choose those whom we love. Apart from the fact that it is more or less completely a matter of chance whom one meets anyway, the truth is that\n  the reasons we are attracted to someone else in the first place are deeply mysterious. We are much less in control here than we like to suppose. A person of kindness and virtue, in whom we find\n  nothing to which to object, can leave us indifferent or cold from a romantic point of view, whereas someone else who is without these virtues may, for reasons that are almost completely unclear,\n  appeal to us profoundly. Perhaps, as Stendhal says, it is his hat that is the problem:\n\nA generous man showers a girl who is unhappy with the most delicate kindnesses; he has every virtue and it seems that love will be born. But he wears a shabby hat, and she\n      notices that he mounts his horse in an inelegant manner. She tells herself with a sigh that she can never respond to the attention he gives her. (De l\u2019amour: 51)\n\nThe mystery is how a mere hat can make all the difference. But it can, perhaps because in some enigmatic way it symbolizes something for the potential lover that she finds\n  unpleasant. Or, of course, someone\u2019s hat might work in the opposite way and attract us on account of the symbolic charge it carries for us. But the effect a person\u2019s hat has on us, in\n  one way or another, is not something we choose.\n\nIt is very important to remember that what makes us fall in love with someone might be some minor aspect of his or her manner, or way of moving, or style of speech. It is important, because\n  believing that we have control over our love, over our loves, can lead to those forms of self-reproach that I mentioned earlier. This is not to say that one should not work at love: beyond the\n  first period of intoxication, and when a measure of sobriety returns, one will certainly need to do that. But it is to say that love is not, contrary to received wisdom, unconditional. If\n  you are in a relationship with someone and things begin to go wrong, then, unless you have had enough of the whole thing, you will want to find solutions to the problems. But it is important that\n  you do not make things worse by insisting that true love is unconditional and berating yourself for your incapacity to love in such a way. It is better to be honest and seek to find and nurture\n  those contingencies which sparked the love in the first place. Of course you will need to talk things through with your lover, but you might also be able to help your relationship even more by\n  buying your partner a quirky hat \u2013 or going to see a madcap film together, or inviting friends out for a meal with you both: this would be part of what Nietzsche calls being\n  \u2018superficial out of profundity\u2019.\n\nWhat we need so often is to see the other as we first saw him or her, and this is one reason why Alain, in his short essay on the life of the couple in his Thoughts on Happiness,\n  proposes that one solution to such problems in life might well be to spend time, as a couple, with others. Being with others means that we must be polite, he suggests, and this itself works\n  positively to dissipate negative emotions. Moreover, the company of others occupies the mind and distracts from a destructive self-indulgence. \u2018This is why\u2019, he adds, \u2018one must\n  always be fearful for a couple that is too isolated and depends only on love\u2019 (Propos sur le bonheur: 92\u20133). Clearly, what Alain has in mind is that, in company, you see your\n  partner more as you did when you first got to know him or her, and this can remind you of what you liked so much about that person in the first place. If love is conditional, then nurture the\n  conditions; do not seek to cultivate a love that can dispense with them.\n\nFoolishness\n\n\u2018When we are born, we cry that we are come / To this great stage of fools\u2019 says King Lear. But we all naturally think that the others are the fools and we are not.\n  This is why a trap that it is easy to fall into, even when your relationship is basically good, is complacency.\n\nOne magnificent exploration of such complacency is Ingmar Bergman\u2019s film Scenes from a Marriage. Johan and Marianne have what seems to be a perfect marriage: two beautiful\n  children, successful careers, money \u2013 the lot. But the seeds of destruction are clear from the first scene, in which Johan boasts of his intelligence and sensitivity, and a later scene in\n  which they clearly take themselves to be hard-nosed realists when it comes to themselves, their life, and their marriage. They obviously think themselves above their friends Peter and Eva, who\n  quarrel violently over dinner when they visit. But it is this very complacency that destroys them. They gradually realize that they are no better than anyone else; they are just as weak, vulnerable\n  and unsure about their lives as others. They are, in a word, just as foolish \u2013 Bergman calls then \u2018emotionally illiterate\u2019. It is good fortune rather than any great talent or\n  intelligence on their part that has kept them together. This is not to say that you do not need to work to make a relationship thrive or that talent and intelligence cannot help in this regard. But\n  it is to say that a more helpful attitude is one of gratitude: to be grateful is to acknowledge the large residue of mystery in whatever it is that makes love endure. And Johan and\n  Marianne do not see this. They think they have what they have by right. To think that is to run the risk of the kind of complacency that destroys them.\n\nSo one of the things necessary to keep love thriving is a healthy sense of one\u2019s own foolishness, as I mentioned in the previous chapter. This is not a matter of self-criticism or the\n  desire to reduce oneself in one\u2019s own eyes. It is rather a matter of cultivating the capacity to laugh at oneself. It is a willingness to acknowledge that one knows much less than one thinks\n  one does about what is good for one\u2019s beloved. It is a matter of acknowledging how little one understands anyone else \u2013 especially, perhaps, the person one loves \u2013 and resisting\n  the impulse to criticize what that person thinks or feels. \u2018All of us are inconsiderate and imprudent, all unreliable, dissatisfied, ambitious . . . corrupt,\u2019 as the Roman philosopher\n  Seneca reminds us pithily. \u2018Therefore, whatever fault he censures in another man, every man will find it residing in his own heart\u2019 (\u2018On Anger\u2019: 40).\n\nFriendship\n\nIt is, in short, a matter of being a good friend.\n\nAristotle distinguished three bases for friendship: utility, pleasure and shared virtue or goodness. Some friendships, he said, are a matter of the friends being useful to each other, as in the\n  friendship between colleagues, or between the client and the provider of a service \u2013 say, between you and the architect you employ to renovate your house. The second type of friendship is\n  based on shared pleasure, as in those, for example, who enjoy sports together. The final type of friendship is, says Aristotle, the best: it is the \u2018complete friendship . . . of good people\n  similar in virtue\u2019 (Nicomachean Ethics: 1156b, 6). And it is the best, he says, because, unlike the other two forms of friendship, which dissolve if the utility or pleasure no longer\n  exists, it is enduring. Moreover, its great value is evident in that each friend cares about the other for the other\u2019s sake, and not simply on account of what he or she can provide by way of\n  utility or pleasure. This third type of friendship is also itself useful and contains pleasure, so it is a kind of synthesis of all that is good in the other two forms.\n\nIt is not hard to see what Aristotle is getting at, but it seems to me that he presents an overly moralized view of friendship. This is because he imagines that true friendship involves the\n  friends in what one might call a shared project for the good, and central to their concern for each other is concern for their respective virtue, for the cultivation of virtue in each other. We can\n  see this in Aristotle\u2019s famous claim that \u2018the friend is another himself\u2019 (Nicomachean Ethics: 1166a, 31\u201332) and in his idea that \u2018each [friend] moulds the\n  other in what they approve of\u2019 (Nicomachean Ethics: 1172a, 13\u201314). And that seems to me not only false to the nature of some genuine friendships but also unduly normative, that\n  is, it tells us not what friendship is but what it ought to be.\n\nAn example to make my point is to be found in the film Werner Herzog made about his friendship with Klaus Kinski, which he ironically entitled Mein liebster Feind \u2013 My Best\n  Fiend, as it came out in English, but more literally and correctly: \u2018My Dearest Enemy\u2019 (there is a play in the German on Feind, \u2018enemy\u2019 and Freund,\n  \u2018friend\u2019). Despite all the \u2013 sometimes massive \u2013 conflict and hostility between the two men, they were clearly very close friends. Of course, you can always insist that\n  unless a friendship is of the kind Aristotle values it is not a real friendship. But that is surely a case of fitting reality to the theory rather than allowing reflection to be properly responsive\n  to the nature of reality. In truth, we love our friends in part for their faults, as Herzog loved Kinski, and, if we did not, we would have no friends, for we all have faults. Moreover, whilst\n  friends may share certain traits with one another, friendship involves a capacity to be continuously aware of and accept the other as different from us. The philosopher Richard Wollheim is, I\n  think, closer to the truth than Aristotle when he says that\n\n[t]he essence of friendship lies, I suggest, in the exercise of a capacity to perceive, a willingness to respect, and a desire to understand, the differences between\n      persons. Friendship lies in a response to the singularity of persons, and a person\u2019s friendship extends only as far as such singularity engages him. (The Thread of Life:\n      275\u20136)\n\nIf you want to be a good friend to the one you love, and if you want to solve the kinds of problems that inevitably arise between lovers, then, in all likelihood, part of what\n  you need to do is to take Wollheim\u2019s view of friendship to heart.\n\nIt is hard to do this, because one of the hardest things to do in life is to leave others alone. We have a natural tendency to think we know what is best for others and to want to tell\n  them what to do. Reminding oneself of one\u2019s foolishness is a way to counteract this. Moreover, I have come to believe that pretty much all criticism is at best pointless, at worst\n  counterproductive, even when it is justified, certainly in the context of personal relationships. Even in those rare instances where criticism might be productive, it is a matter of extraordinarily\n  delicate judgement, and most of us, most of the time, are likely to get it wrong. We should learn to be more cautious and circumspect when it comes to giving advice to those we love than we\n  normally are.\n\nEgoism\n\nI mentioned above that one of the views about love that we have inherited from Christianity is that it is wholly selfless. We believe this in part because we tend to think of\n  the vices as being wholly opposed to the virtues. But this is a myth. The virtues are nourished by the vices. As La Rochefoucauld puts it in his Maxims: \u2018The vices enter into the\n  composition of the virtues as poison enters into the composition of medicines. Prudence assembles and tempers them, and uses them against the ills of life\u2019 (Maximes, no.182). Vanity\n  and self-love enter into all kinds of virtues, helping to make them what they are. Of course, as La Rochefoucauld insists, they have to be tempered, but this is not the same thing as extirpating\n  them. And romantic love certainly has its own share of egoism. The reason for this is that such love expresses a need of the other. In an acute discussion of Shakespeare\u2019s Antony\n  and Cleopatra, Allan Bloom brings this out magnificently. Speaking of the love the eponymous couple share, he writes:\n\nThis is not the confident and giving love so much admired in modernity. It is utterly selfish, and perhaps reveals more accurately the true nature of love as desperate need\n      of each other. To my mind, Cleopatra\u2019s complaint to the dying Antony, \u2018Hast thou no care of me?\u2019 (IV.xv.60), is a more powerful statement of love than are selfless expressions\n      of sorrow or regret. Each is directed to the other by ineluctable need. Their admiration for each other means that they must possess each other no matter what the consequences. It is a hunger\n      and a possessiveness more powerful than any other. Few men or women are capable of such selfish self-forgetting. (Love and Friendship: 305)\n\nAntony and Cleopatra may be extreme, but they only bring out something that is implicit in all romantic love, namely, its egoistic self-concern. The point is not, of course,\n  that one should seek to be selfish in love, or that we can never see selfishness as destructive of eros. It is rather a question of being honest about its nature. As with the idea that love is\n  unconditional, the thought that love is wholly selfless can lead to self-reproach and frustration, especially if you are confronting problems in a relationship. All relationships involve an\n  ever-shifting balance of power, and those who hope to find stability by seeking to allow themselves to be absorbed selflessly into their lover\u2019s needs usually find in the end that they have\n  been complicit in something destructive. What is required is a balancing act between difference forces, not a doomed attempt to rid the relationship, or one side of it, of all force.\n\nA Fable\n\nThe German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer recounts a fable in which he compares human beings to porcupines. On a cold day, the porcupines huddled together for warmth, but, in\n  doing so, hurt each other with their spines. So they moved apart, but in this way became cold again. Human beings, says Schopenhauer, are like this: we crave the warm intimacy of closeness with\n  others, especially in romantic love, but, once we get it, we can end up hurting each other through that very closeness. That can engender many conflicting emotions, perhaps the most common of\n  which, and the most likely therefore to damage a relationship, are anger and jealousy.\n\nHuman beings\u2019 quills are more difficult to see, but can inflict much pain.\n\nAnger\n\nThe ancient philosophers were especially interested in anger and how to avoid it or control it. They have some very helpful things to say. For example, in an essay on anger,\n  which repeats some of the advice offered earlier by Seneca, Plutarch gives a large role to Fundanus, who was consul in 107 AD and, apparently, notoriously quick-tempered. Fundanus tells us how he\n  managed to tame his anger, and recommends a number of things to us to this end. For example, he reflects on the fact that the physical aspect of the angry person is deeply undignified: distorted\n  features, flushing face, change of voice and so on. Realizing all this, he says, he became reluctant to appear so \u2018unhinged\u2019 to others, and says he wishes he could have an attendant who\n  would hold a mirror up to him whenever he is angry, in order to remind him to avoid such indignity. Then he tells us to reflect on others who resisted anger, even when anger might have been\n  justified.\n\nMy favourite example is that of Antigonus, who overheard some of his soldiers cursing him close to his tent, unaware that he could hear them. He looked out at them and said: \u2018Oh dear,\n  can\u2019t you go further away to criticize me?\u2019 Fundanus also tells us that if we are angry we should wait to act, because, once we cool down, a more moderate response may seem more\n  sensible. Then he suggests that anger is nearly always the result of our feeling slighted or ignored, so we should seek to develop a sense of indifference to such feelings \u2013 like Diogenes\n  who, when he was told that some people were laughing at him, replied: \u2018But I don\u2019t feel laughed at.\u2019 And again Fundanus recommends that we learn to be pleased with small things,\n  to develop a simple lifestyle \u2013 not to be fussy about what we eat and drink, for example. We should learn, he says, \u2018not to need a lot of extras\u2019 (\u2018On the Avoidance of\n  Anger\u2019: 194). And Fundanus emphasizes that these strategies can help when it comes to intimate relationships.\n\nTo all this we may add Seneca\u2019s advice about seeking to know one\u2019s own limits so that one does not take on tasks that are overly demanding; failure will otherwise be likely and anger\n  the probable consequence. In the situation of romantic love, the point is helpful: do not expect yourself to give more than you can. This is not a plea for laziness, of course, but for a realistic\n  sense of who we are. I once asked a friend, who has been in a healthy relationship for the best part of thirty years, what the secret was. He answered: \u2018Low expectations\u2019. That could be\n  interpreted as miserably cynical, but it was not. He was being realistic \u2013 not only about what the relationship could give him, but also about what he could give to the relationship. Doing\n  moral press-ups is much more difficult than physical ones, and usually leads to disaster. As the French essayist Montaigne put it, if you seek to fly like an angel you will crash all the more\n  violently to earth.\n\nSeneca also advises us to nurture the mind with \u2018pleasurable arts\u2019: \u2018pleasant pursuits prove a balm to the troubled mind\u2019 (\u2018On Anger\u2019: 26). Applied to the\n  context of love, this is in accord with my earlier thought about nurturing contingencies: love is nourished through the couple\u2019s sharing pleasure together. Pleasant pursuits prove a balm to\n  troubled love. The point is obvious. We all know it. But it is worth reiterating, because we forget it so easily.\n\nNone of this is to deny that anger can ever be justified \u2013 though that is what Plutarch thought \u2013 but it is an appeal to us to learn to educate our anger.\n\nThe anecdote about Antigonus is especially revealing. For what he has clearly grasped is that it is no use expecting not to be criticized. He accepts the fact that one will inevitably\n  be criticized, and that the best thing is not to rail against that. His outlook is very close to something expressed by Nietzsche in Human, all too Human in the context of friendship.\n\nJust think about how different feelings are, how divided the opinions, about even the closest acquaintance; how even the same opinions in the heads of our friends have a\n      quite different place or intensity than in yours; how hundreds of times there are grounds for misunderstandings, for flight filled with enmity. After all that, you will say to yourself:\n      \u2018How unsure is the ground on which all our bonds and friendships rest, how close are cold downpours and bad weather, how lonely is each person!\u2019 Whoever grasps this . . . will\n      perhaps . . . cry: \u2018Friends, there are no friends!\u2019 But rather he will admit to himself: \u2018Indeed, there are friends, but error or illusions about you have brought them to you;\n      and they must have learnt to be silent in order to remain your friend. For such human relationships rest almost always on the fact that a few things are never said, indeed, that they are never\n      touched upon . . . Are there people who would not be mortally wounded if they found out what their most intimate friends in the final analysis think of them?\u2019 (Menschliches,\n      Allzumenschliches: ein Buch f\u00fcr freie Geister: I, 376)\n\nNietzsche\u2019s point is that friendship depends in part on the kind of tact that involves a willingness not to know all the other thinks of one, a willingness to\n  accept that one cannot know these things. In other words, friendships flourish, amongst other things, under conditions of mutual incomprehension: your friend will\n  inevitably remain, in many ways, a mystery to you, and that is one of the things that nourishes the friendship. And the same goes for romantic love, as Dorothy Rowe pointed out (Depression: the\n  Way out of Your Prison: 133\u20134). If you want your love to flourish, accept that you cannot fully know your beloved, that your beloved cannot fully know you, and that, per\n  impossibile, were you to know each other fully, that would kill the love.\n\nJealousy\n\nBearing this in mind can also help when dealing with jealousy, one of the emotions most destructive of love. Many people are subject to jealousy in romantic relationships, and\n  there can, of course, be times when it is justified. However, it is well known that jealousy, once it is triggered, can take a hold in a way which is self-perpetuating, feeding on suspicion in such\n  a way that there is nothing the person who is the object of that jealousy can do to assuage it. The reason for this is that jealousy wants something it cannot have: it desires a kind of perfect\n  surveillance of another, and, even if it could achieve this with respect to another\u2019s behaviour, it cannot do so in the case of another\u2019s thoughts and feelings. There are two principal\n  reasons for this: firstly, even if the jealous person knows in a general way what the other thinks and feels, there is always room for interpreting this knowledge in order to make it seem as if it\n  justified the jealousy in question; secondly, it just is not possible to know precisely and completely what another thinks and feels.\n\nOne of the things one should bear in mind if one is prone to jealousy is that nothing can satisfy it. Further, what the jealous person wants is, ultimately, that the other person not have a life\n  of his or her own, as Tolstoy brings out so magnificently in exploring Anna\u2019s jealousy of Vronsky, and Proust brings out in Marcel\u2019s attitude towards Albertine. It is the thought that\n  Vronsky and Albertine have aspects of their lives which do not involve Anna and Marcel respectively that is unbearable to them. Yet, the painful irony is, as Proust brings out, that it is precisely\n  the sense that the other person can introduce us to a whole other world that is one of the things that makes us fall in love with him or her in the first place. That the beloved lives in a world\n  that is not one\u2019s own and to which one can be introduced is immensely exciting, but jealousy feeds off the same sense of the otherness of the beloved. This is one of the reasons why love and\n  jealousy so often go hand in hand: they are nurtured, in part, from the same source. If you suffer from jealousy, you should try to remind yourself not only that what you want is futile, because it\n  cannot be achieved, but also that whatever is tormenting you is, in all likelihood, the very same thing that made you love the other person in the first place. As ever in life, one has to pay, and\n  the idea that any condition of life could give us all we want is a mere chimera.\n\nBeyond that, it is, of course, true that jealousy in the context of romantic love is most likely to be occasioned by sexual infidelity or fear of such. Both the experience of falling in love and\n  the profounder love that issues from this as the relationship deepens tell us that the normal state of affairs is fidelity and that infidelity is bad. But what this way of looking at things\n  overlooks is that fidelity is not something simply to be expected, but a real and deep achievement. This was expressed comically but wisely by Dustin Hoffman when he was\n  interviewed for Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4. A friend had given him the following advice, he explained: \u2018the only way a marriage can be successful is that the husband is\n  scared shitless of his wife\u2019. Hoffman recognized that there was something profound in that because, in his view, we are \u2013 Hoffman had men in mind in particular, obviously enough \u2013\n  not well suited by nature to remain in a relationship with one person for the length of time that, these days, we often suppose the norm \u2013 as it might be, a lifetime. Commitment, he\n  said, is difficult, requiring a great deal of diligence and discipline. Fear of one\u2019s wife, he suggested, helps keep one from straying.\n\nHoffman\u2019s realistic and humorous wisdom is echoed by the General\u2019s melancholy wisdom in his reflections on fidelity in S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai\u2019s novel Embers.\n  Looking back on the liaison that his best friend, Konrad, had had with his, the General\u2019s, wife over forty years before, he says:\n\nWhat is fidelity, what do we expect of the woman we love? I am old, and I have thought a great deal about this too. Is the idea of fidelity not an appalling egoism and also\n      as vain as most other human concerns? When we demand fidelity, are we wishing for the other person\u2019s happiness? And if that person cannot be happy in the subtle prison of fidelity, do we\n      really prove our love by demanding fidelity nonetheless? . . . Now, in my old age, I would not dare answer these questions as unequivocally as I would have done forty-one years ago . . .\n      (Embers: 220)\n\nThat we find it hard to accept what is being said here is a sign of its truth.\n\nIn Mozart\u2019s opera Cos\u00ec fan tutte, two officers, Ferrando and Guglielmo are engaged to two sisters, Dorabella and Fiordiligi respectively. Don Alfonso (a vecchio\n  filosofo: an old philosopher) claims that, contrary to the soldiers\u2019 claims that their fianc\u00e9es will be eternally faithful, he can prove that, like all women, they are fickle. A\n  bet is made. Ferrando and Guglielmo leave, ostensibly to go to war, then reappear disguised as \u2018Albanians\u2019. In this guise, they manage to seduce the two women. The truth is revealed to\n  all, and Don Alfonso urges the two officers to forgive their fianc\u00e9es \u2013 after all, \u2018cos\u00ec fan tutte\u2019: \u2018all women are like that\u2019 (literally,\n  \u2018thus do all [women]\u2019).\n\nSome have seen the opera as misogynistic or cynical. But Mozart\u2019s extraordinary music, in my view, allows the opera to transcend these categories and shows us an affirmative attitude\n  towards human weakness and vulnerability, an urbane acceptance of the vicissitudes of all things human. And we should, after all, grant that fidelity is difficult, meaning that we could never\n  understand the very concept of fidelity unless we understood it as something not easily or readily embodied in human life. Human beings are fickle by nature, as Machiavelli said. Hence it is that\n  fidelity is an extraordinary achievement, and the jealous lover might do well to reflect on his or her jealousy in the light of the difficulty of fidelity. If we start from that thought, jealousy\n  might become more tractable, precisely because a space has been opened up to see the cause of it \u2013 infidelity \u2013 not simply as dreadful without residue, but, as in Embers and\n  Cos\u00ec fan tutte, as just one more expression of the terrible weakness of human beings as they make their hesitant, halting way through life.\n\nOf course, I recognize that such an attitude is immensely difficult, especially when one is caught up in the throes of jealousy. For this reason, it is wise to reflect on such things when calm,\n  in advance of experiencing jealousy, in case one does experience it. In other words, it is sensible to prepare oneself. It is worth remembering that peace of mind does not come easily or\n  quickly and is a rare and difficult achievement. And if we ever achieve wisdom in these matters, our hold on it remains far from wholly secure. Samuel Johnson was right, in his cautionary tale\n  Rasselas, to worry about fine-sounding words and have his character Imlac say: \u2018Be not too hasty . . . to trust, or to admire the teachers of morality: they discourse like angels,\n  but they live like men\u2019 (The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia: 80). But that, too, expresses a kind of melancholy wisdom, and Johnson would have been the last to take it as a\n  recommendation that one not seek to educate one\u2019s emotional responses to the adversities of life. Indeed, his whole life stands as a moving testament to just that struggle.\n\nThe Limits of Love\n\nIn Corinthians, Paul presents love as universal in its power: it never fails, he insists. But he is wrong. It does. You can love someone you do not like; you can stop loving\n  someone you do like; you and your partner can still love each other but be unable to be together. Love is just one aspect of a relationship, and by itself it is not enough to make a\n  success of things. But part of the problem lies in what one counts as success and failure. We see the end of a relationship as a failure, but this is not necessarily the best way to think of\n  things. Of course, no one can deny that when things come to an end, however they do, it is usually extremely painful for one of the partners or both. But I am not convinced that things are as\n  clear-cut as we often suppose them to be.\n\nA friend of mine told me that, though he was divorced, he did not really have the sense that he had \u2018married the wrong woman\u2019, as the clich\u00e9d phrase has it. In part, this was\n  because he had had children with this woman, and nothing was more important to him than they were. Beyond that, he was puzzled by the idea that he could think of his ex-wife as \u2018the wrong\n  woman\u2019, because it seemed to presuppose that there might have been, or might be, the \u2018right woman\u2019 somewhere: a woman with whom he would experience no difficulties whatsoever.\n  But, he said to me, this is not so: his current relationship might be better than his marriage was, but this does not show that he \u2018had got it wrong\u2019 before, except in the obvious sense\n  that the marriage ended. With his ex-wife he had had good and bad times, highs and lows \u2013 but all of that, he said, was his life. And though he might regret certain aspects of his\n  life, he could not regret the whole thing.\n\nMy friend\u2019s sense of the end of his marriage expressed, I think, a kind of fierce attachment to his own life as something uniquely valuable, not despite, but because of all its errors.\n  There is wisdom in such a view and, if you are going through the loss of a loved one, you might find that reflecting on it helps a little: if not now, then at some later point, with luck and hard\n  work, you might be able to see things in this way. Your life is, like my friend\u2019s, uniquely valuable, not despite its disappointments but because of them, including those suffered in\n  love.",

      "content": "# 3. Vulnerability; or, Adversity in the Body\n\nI am sometimes struck, when teaching my students, by our good fortune. Here we are, able to spend two hours thinking about some problem in philosophy \u2013 say, the nature\n  and meaning of religious faith, or the relationship between comedy and tragedy, or what we understand by the concept of a human being. One of the major reasons we can do this is because we are in\n  good health \u2013 we are not troubled by our body in such a way as to make prolonged reflection and discussion difficult or even impossible. Of course, there are sometimes students who are\n  suffering from some illness, more or less serious, and they are admirable in their determination to continue to study. But they represent the exception. And the fact remains that, for most of the\n  history of humanity, most people were not generally in a state of health good enough to leave their mind free to reflect on the kinds of things that occupy my students and me in our lessons. On the\n  contrary, ill health and sickness dogged people\u2019s lives in a way that, fortunately, is much less common in the developed world \u2013 though there are, of course, plenty of people elsewhere\n  in the world who are not so lucky.\n\nNonetheless, illness has not been wholly eradicated from the human world, and it never will be. And in illness we realize how fragile and vulnerable the body is, how much we accept good health\n  as if it were the norm when, in fact, it is more a matter of good fortune than anything we have by right. In illness, we have to face our essential weakness: the adversity of the body. In this\n  chapter, I propose to reflect on some ways in which we might do that.\n\nMontaigne and the Vulnerability of the Body\n\nTowards the end of his life, Montaigne suffered from kidney stones, to which he had inherited a propensity from his father. Kidney stones are caused by a build-up of calcium or\n  other minerals in the body, creating spiked or jagged crystals, like fragments of shattered glass. They can cause extraordinarily acute pain, not only in the abdomen but also in the ureter as they\n  pass into the bladder; the sensation is like being burnt on the inside. These days they can be treated, but in Montaigne\u2019s day all one could hope to do was pass them out in the urine, itself\n  an intensely painful experience. Indeed, in Montaigne\u2019s time kidney stones carried a risk of death through infection, and it is said that the pain was by itself intense enough to lead some\n  sufferers to contemplate suicide.\n\nIn his Essays Montaigne speaks from time to time about his kidney stones, and some of the most revealing and moving passages are to be found in the very last essay, \u2018On\n  Experience\u2019, in which he traces out some of the ways in which he sought to cope with the illness. But the essay is more than that: it is also a plea for the body, for its needs and its\n  legitimacy, an entreaty that we accept it, together with the strange demands it makes upon us. There is in all of Montaigne\u2019s writings a calm acceptance of the body, a sense of its\n  loveliness, even as it is vulnerable to illness. He wants us to see that, whilst our physical vulnerability makes us liable to illness, it also opens us up to physical pleasure and delight. Hence,\n  he speaks in generous terms of our need to eat, drink and sleep, encouraging us to enjoy these things for, after all, we have no choice but to follow their demands, and he even tells us that he\n  likes scratching himself, particularly his ear, he says, which often gets itchy.\n\nMontaigne believed that sixteenth-century France was too suspicious of pleasure, and I doubt that he would have thought the modern world any different: what we so readily take for pleasure he\n  would have seen as the miserable pursuit of empty satisfaction, the expression of an unavowed wretchedness which makes our pursuit of pleasure desperate even as it makes it unobtainable. He would\n  say that our very insistence on pleasure in the modern age is a sign that something is wrong, that what we want is not so much pleasure as self-forgetfulness \u2013 the abandonment of all thought\n  and judgement in a miserable carnival of intoxication. The synecdoche of this is the contemporary attitude towards erotic desire, in which sex is less about pleasure and more about a kind of\n  desperate longing to escape ourselves in an abandonment to, and of, the senses so intense that it puts an end to all future pleasure, as if we could disburden ourselves of the demands of the body\n  at one fell swoop and be liberated forever from its demands. Our hubris prevents our getting what we truly want, in part because it stops us asking what it is we truly want. Our age is, in\n  its own way, as far away as was Montaigne\u2019s from accepting his advice neither to flee from pleasures nor to chase after them.\n\nGiven Montaigne\u2019s generous understanding of the body, it is not surprising that he has some things to say about being ill on which it is worth meditating. His final essay is a kind of\n  therapy of illness. So, for example, he tells us that in confronting his own illness \u2013 not just kidney stones, though he was certainly thinking about them too \u2013 he sought neither to\n  fight it relentlessly nor to give in to it weakly, but to allow it its place, according to its nature and his own. We must, he says, \u2018submit gently to the laws of our condition. We exist in\n  order to get old and weak, to fall ill, despite what medicine offers\u2019 (\u2018De l\u2019experience\u2019: 299). He counsels us that we should not complain if something happens to\n  us that could happen to anyone, and reminds us that, whilst we can often look on the illness and pain of others with equanimity, we complain bitterly when we experience the same things. There is in\n  Montaigne a kind of solidarity with others which encourages us to recognize that we are nothing special as individuals \u2013 that what happens to others can happen to us, and that that is just\n  the way things are.\n\nIn addition to all this, Montaigne explicitly lists the things that have helped him cope with the illness caused by his kidney stones: he recognizes it as simply part of growing old; he sees\n  that many of the men he most respects have the same disease, and he is honoured by being in their company; he is grateful that illness has come to him late in life, since he was free to enjoy his\n  youth; and he takes delight in being praised by others for his fortitude in the face of his illness. He also points out that, in the past, some people called down upon themselves various illnesses\n  as part of the practice of asceticism, in the belief that to do so promoted virtue. He would never do this, he says \u2013 but the illness that has come unbidden is teaching him this lesson, for\n  which he can thus be grateful. Further, he grants that, although his kidney stones might precipitate his death, so might any number of other illnesses that he happens not to have; and lastly he\n  says that the illness is weaning him from life, allowing him to face his own inevitable death with greater equanimity. And in an extraordinarily striking turn of phrase, he ends this part of his\n  reflections thus: \u2018You are not dying because you are ill; you are dying because you are alive. Death kills you perfectly well without the aid of illness\u2019 (\u2018De\n  l\u2019experience\u2019: 302).\n\nIn his study, Montaigne had inscribed on the beams quotations from some of his favourite classical authors. He wanted to be forever reminded of the wisdom they offered in the\n      face of adversity.\n\nThere is in Montaigne\u2019s reflections a massive sense of reality, a capacity to grasp experience directly and for himself that is rare. He is able to see clearly what is happening to him and\n  at the same time find consolation in his agony, without self-deception. And he is able to turn his suffering to account, to put it to use. Moreover, he helps us see that the way one thinks of\n  one\u2019s body is not fixed; we have a certain flexibility here, a capacity to conceptualize, to imagine and to experience the body in new ways.\n\nVery few of us, I think, possess as clear a sense of ourselves and our reality as Montaigne did. Certainly this is true in my own case. Some little while ago I was ill. It was nothing serious\n  \u2013 mainly I was rather run down, but I also had heart palpitations and some problems with my eyes. I had a series of tests with my GP and at the hospital, but no underlying or fundamental\n  problem was discovered. Nonetheless, the symptoms continued to get worse \u2013 dizziness, pins and needles and so on. At about this time, I was fortunate to be able to spend a few months in\n  Italy. The moment I arrived, my symptoms disappeared: the change of climate and lifestyle snapped me out of my routines and broke the cycle of the illness. It was immediately evident to me that\n  what had really been making me ill was my anxiety about being ill. I had been ill to start with, but somehow an anxiety about being ill had got hold of me, and I continued to be ill simply from the\n  thought that I was ill. But I am sure that, had I been able to learn from Montaigne, my symptoms would have disappeared long before I went to Italy. This experience was all the more striking in\n  that I am not given to hypochondria in general. I know that what I experienced is quite common: we all \u2013 most of us, anyway \u2013 can make an illness worse by not seeing it as merely part\n  of the flow of life, by reaching out too quickly to rid ourselves of it, by fretting about it. This is not to say we should not seek medical help if we need it. But it is to say that we ought, like\n  Montaigne, to try to be realistic about the vulnerability of our body. Ironically, accepting your weakness can make you strong.\n\nA Narrative of Illness: the Possibility of Gratitude\n\nSome of the points I made about how we think of the body are well articulated \u2013 though not in the context of Montaigne, whom he does not mention \u2013 by Arthur W. Frank\n  in his helpful book The Wounded Storyteller. Frank explores some of the ways in which we can give a narrative of illness \u2013 that is, think about it, give an account of it,\n  tell a story about it. And, in Frank\u2019s terms, Montaigne construes the narrative of his illness as a quest. Such quest narratives, he says, \u2018meet suffering head on; they accept illness\n  and seek to use it\u2019 (The Wounded Storyteller: 115).\n\nJohn Updike, who had a lifelong battle with extreme psoriasis, also exemplifies this kind of narrative. Having sought relief from his illness for many years by massive exposure to the sun in\n  summer, he was eventually able to find help in a new form of treatment in the 1970s known as PUVA, a kind of UVA light therapy. And yet, once \u2018clear\u2019, he wondered whether there was not,\n  after all, an intimate connection between his skin condition and his abilities and resilience as a writer. \u2018Only psoriasis,\u2019 he writes, \u2018could have taken a very average little boy\n  . . . and made him into a . . . writer. What was my creativity . . . but a parody of my skin\u2019s embarrassing overproduction? Was not my thick literary skin . . . a superior version of my poor\n  vulnerable own . . .?\u2019 (\u2018At War with My Skin\u2019: 75).\n\nUpdike expresses here the capacity to turn illness to account \u2013 though it is only in retrospect that he sees himself as having done this. Moreover, he displays a very\n  under-acknowledged ability to show gratitude for illness, an ability to remind himself that it is possible to be grateful for that which hurts us, because it can make us into more than we would\n  have been without it. No doubt Updike would have taken the treatment for his psoriasis much sooner in his life, had it been available. But what he makes us acknowledge is that a cure for illness is\n  not always something that we have good reason to want. This is not, of course, a way of saying that illness is (or some illnesses are) good; it is, rather, a way of reminding us that we can each\n  ask for ourselves what we truly and deeply want and need in life, and that the removal of illness (as with other adversities) might well, in some cases at least, make getting closer to that more\n  difficult.\n\nWe should all try to do what Updike did and think about whether the things we want to rid ourselves of are not part of what makes our lives worthwhile. If you want to be in perfect health all\n  the time, and you get what you want, it might make you complacent and self-satisfied. It might make you insensitive and uncaring to others. Or it might mean that your life lacks the kind of\n  \u2018edge\u2019 which can help you see the world from an individual perspective and hence be related to things in a more productive, more intense way. Illness is not always a bad thing, and it\n  is not always to be feared.\n\nFurther Narratives of Illness: Triumph and Silence\n\nThe two other types of illness narrative that Frank mentions are what he calls \u2018the restitution narrative\u2019 and \u2018the chaos narrative\u2019.\n\nThe former is a kind of story in which illness is construed as a temporary hiatus or deviation in the narrative of a life, after which life returns to \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 that is, to\n  its state before the illness, a state of health. This is, as Frank points out, the dominant narrative in the modern West, encouraged by the extraordinary growth in the powers of medical science. He\n  points out that one of the disadvantages of this kind of narrative is that it can be triumphalist, as if all illness were curable; another is that it helps us conceal from ourselves the reality of\n  death: each illness, even a terminal one, is broken down into a series of manageable and treatable maladies, helping us to evade the truth of our mortality. He describes the death of his\n  mother-in-law in this way:\n\nWhen my mother-in-law, Laura Foote, was dying from cancer, we all knew she was dying. At least one reason why our family never talked about her dying was that until two days\n      before she died we remained fixed on the incremental remedies that medicine continued to offer. However clear her deterioration, there was always another treatment to offer. As long as small\n      puzzles could be solved, fixing this or medicating that, the big issue of mortality was evaded. Each specialist carried out his task with some success, and the patient died. (The Wounded\n      Storyteller: 84)\n\nThe latter narrative, the chaos narrative, is no real kind of narrative, because the person is suffering so deeply that there is no perspective that he or she can get\n  on the pain, in order to put it into a story. As Frank mentions, the capacity to speak about one\u2019s suffering always put one at some distance from its source, and can help one to cope with it.\n  The deepest forms of suffering are in this sense silent. This reminds us of something we know, but often forget, namely that much human suffering is nothing more than unmitigated pain, pointless\n  torment. We should all, perhaps particularly those who are thinking or writing about making sense of illness and bodily fragility, seek to bear this in mind, in order not to lose sight of the real\n  nature of our own and others\u2019 suffering.\n\nHow Do You Think Of Your Body?\n\nTo accompany these narratives, Frank offers different ways in which one can experience the body. Firstly there is the disciplined body, in which one thinks of\n  one\u2019s body as something one possesses and needs to regulate, as one does a machine. Then there is the mirroring body, which is conceived of in the light of, and is modelled on, an\n  ideal image. Thirdly there is the dominating body, which exists as a force against others, through which, say, anger is expressed by venting itself on them. Then there is the\n  communicative body, through which one fully accepts contingency, that is, the sense that one exists in a kind of dynamic relation with the external world and that the boundaries between\n  body and world are unclear and fluid. This notion of the communicative body may seem strange, but the best example is Montaigne\u2019s attitude to his body \u2013 his willingness to see illness\n  as part of the flow of nature through him, and his capacity to find a sense of solidarity with those who suffer, or might suffer, just what he suffers.\n\nOf course, we all think of our bodies in all four of these ways, and often at the same time, to different degrees and depending on the context. But, as I said earlier, what Frank\u2019s\n  conceptual scheme and Montaigne\u2019s reflections alike help us see is that we can think of our bodies in different ways. When faced with an illness one can, with luck and perseverance, meditate\n  on it and on one\u2019s body as Montaigne did, and this might help us to see things somewhat differently and more productively.\n\nThe Need to Find Meaning in Illness\n\nWhen I said that Montaigne had a massive sense of reality, I was thinking of him in the light of a point that Nietzsche makes when he says that it is not suffering that human\n  beings cannot bear, but meaningless suffering. Of course, Montaigne was seeking to find meaning in his illness, but we can sense that the meaning he sought was firmly rooted in the reality of his\n  situation. This is so, even though he was clearly stylizing himself in his illness, that is, seeking to create a perspective on his illness that would see it in noble, grand or similar terms.\n\nOne of the characters in Max Blecher\u2019s great novel of sickness, Scarred Hearts, echoes Montaigne\u2019s view of illness when he says that it can make of one a kind of deeply\n  ironic hero. It may even be that Blecher, who suffered from tuberculosis of the spine, saw himself in this way. The novel is set in a sanatorium, and the character in question, Quintonce,\n  is speaking with a fellow sufferer about his condition, and about the condition of all those in the institution. He claims that every hero, in order to achieve his goal, needs both energy and\n  willpower.\n\nWell, every invalid displays these. In the space of one year, an invalid expends exactly the same amount of energy and willpower one would need to conquer an empire . . .\n      Except only that he consumes it in pure loss. That is why invalids could be called the most negative of heroes. Each one of us is \u201cthe one who wasn\u2019t Caesar\u201d, even though he\n      has fulfilled all the conditions necessary for being one . . . To be possessed of all the component elements of a Caesar and yet to be . . . an invalid. It is a surprisingly ironic form of\n      heroism. (Scarred Hearts: 84)\n\nI am sure that Montaigne would have appreciated the faintly absurd, self-deprecating but also self-valorizing notion of the ill person \u2013 in this case, an invalid \u2013\n  as an ironic hero. He would have taken delight in the idea\u2019s strange, indeed absurd, combination of domestic insignificance and worldly grandeur. It would have made him laugh.\n\nMax Blecher, an ironic hero, with his mother.\n\nUpdike, whom I mentioned earlier, provides another, altogether more earnest way of finding meaning in illness, prior to his more successful treatment for psoriasis. Reflecting on the hours he\n  spent lying in the sun on the beach, seeking relief from his condition, he writes that he always associated this with a kind of forgiveness from God, which was, for him, \u2018a tactile actuality\n  as I lay . . . under the . . . tropical sun. And the sun\u2019s weight on my skin always meant this to me: I was being redeemed, hauled back into mankind . . . from deformity and shame\u2019\n  (\u2018At War with My Skin\u2019: 68).\n\nFor Updike, the meaning of his illness was irreducibly religious, because he saw it in categories that he saw as religious: shame, and redemption through forgiveness. It was this, in part, which\n  enabled him to cope with it: his psoriasis was not simply a form of physical discomfort; it was also, and perhaps more importantly, a kind of connection with God, mediated by the physical world\n  \u2013 and thus a special kind of connection with that world. He found meaning in the illness through the meaning he found in its treatment. A great deal of the work of coping with illness depends\n  on our capacity to find meaning in it, as Montaigne or Quintonce or Updike did \u2013 and there are, of course, countless other ways of doing so.\n\nIndeed, I suspect that we all need to stylize ourselves in one way or another to make sense of illness, especially long-term and serious illness of the kind that afflicted Quintonce and Updike.\n  Quintonce sees himself in the light of Caesar, and there are certainly worse ways of seeing oneself. His approach is much more urbane than that of Updike. In any case, stylizing ourselves when we\n  are ill, and thinking about how our illness might allow us to emulate those we admire, can be productive. Reflecting on what these individuals might say to us in our illness also helps, I think.\n  And this applies not just to illness, of course.\n\nWhilst I have been seeking in this chapter to draw attention to people whom it might be helpful to emulate, we each have to find our own sources of help. This is why we need to try to be\n  attentive to others around us and the story of their life, in order to discover the interesting, the strange, the good and the lovely in them, which we so often miss in the general rush of everyday\n  life. By doing so, not only can we understand them better, but we can also understand ourselves better too.\n\nMaking Things Worse\n\nBut if it is true that we seek meaning in illness, sometimes we can entertain extravagant and unrealistic thoughts about it. This can make matters worse. So, for example, we\n  often link illness and morality, construing illness as a form of punishment. Father Paneloux, in Albert Camus\u2019s novel The Plague, represents someone who thinks this way, at least at\n  the outset, telling his congregation that the plague has come to their town, Oran, as a punishment for their sinful ways. This kind of thing can be found again and again in human history, and it\n  has not disappeared. As Susan Sontag reminds us in her book Illness as Metaphor, illnesses \u2013 her examples are tuberculosis, cancer and AIDS \u2013 have often been used as metaphors:\n  sometimes to blame, sometimes to punish and sometimes for other purposes, such as to control. Her aim in her book is to strip illness of metaphor \u2013 \u2018I have this disease because I am a\n  bad person; this illness is a punishment\u2019, and so on \u2013 in order to remove from it the meanings that make the suffering even worse.\n\nA good and moving example of someone who found meaning in his illness (tuberculosis), but in such a way as to make things worse, was Kafka, whose pained relationship with his father I explored a\n  little in the first chapter. In many ways Kafka was a highly tormented man: as a German-speaking Jew in Prague he felt himself to be an outsider and lived in an almost permanent sense of unease and\n  disorientation, deeply torn as he was between his profound need to be a writer, the requirement to earn his living, and his longing to be able to settle down and have a family. Mentally troubled by\n  this, and with a strong tendency to lacerating forms of self-enquiry and judgement, he constantly thought of his body as inadequate to the spiritual demands he made on himself, and reproached\n  himself for just this:\n\nIt is certain that a major obstacle to my progress is my physical condition. Nothing can be accomplished with such a body . . . My body is too long for its weakness, it\n      hasn\u2019t the least bit of fat to engender a blessed warmth, to preserve an inner fire, no fat on which the spirit could occasionally nourish itself beyond its daily need without damage to\n      the whole. (The Diaries of Franz Kafka 1910\u20131923: 124\u20135)\n\nWhen Kafka suffered his first attack of tuberculosis in 1917, he immediately sought for a meaning to his disease, and construed it as a metaphor for his illness of soul.\n  \u2018For secretly,\u2019 he wrote to Felice Bauer, his fianc\u00e9e, \u2018I don\u2019t believe this illness to be tuberculosis, but rather a sign of my general bankruptcy\u2019. He also\n  construed his tuberculosis in terms of his relationship to his mother, from whom he thought he had inherited it, deriving from it, he wrote in the same letter, \u2018the kind of immense support a\n  child gets from clinging to its mother\u2019s skirts\u2019 (Letters to Felice: 655). Kafka, of course, knew he had tuberculosis, but what he meant was that, although it was an illness,\n  it was a metaphor for what was really wrong with him \u2013 namely his spiritual condition. Kafka saw his tuberculosis not simply as an illness, but as a form of self-judgement;\n  it betrayed him. Moreover, he went on to show a further level of emotional and intellectual investment in his disease, seeing it as both sign and cause of creativity \u2013 the creativity\n  that enabled him to write as he so deeply needed to. Furthermore, he saw it as both a reason for his not getting married and as something that might have gone away had he married.\n\nThe case of Kafka is instructive because it shows the lengths to which some will go to find meaning in their illness. It goes without saying that I am not intending to criticize him. Far from\n  it. My point is rather that we can see in Kafka someone whose torments are made even greater as a result of the particular way in which he sought for a meaning in his illness. If you had been\n  Kafka\u2019s friend you would almost certainly have encouraged him to be gentler on himself. That thought might help you if you have a tendency to be hard on yourself when you are ill, even if you\n  do not go to the same lengths as Kafka in seeking to find meaning in your pain: you might be able to turn it towards yourself and be a little kinder to yourself.\n\nBlaming Others\n\nBut often, when we are ill, it is not simply that we can be harsh on ourselves, as Kafka was on himself: we often have a very strong tendency to blame others for our condition,\n  even as we know that they are not responsible. I do not mean, of course, that every ill person consciously holds others to blame for the illness. When one is ill it is more likely that one will\n  experience anger \u2013 anger with the world, anger because one thinks the world unjust, anger expressed in the thought \u2018Why me?\u2019 And since other people are part of the world, they are\n  likely to become the objects of one\u2019s anger as they stray into one\u2019s path, so to speak. One takes it out on others. There can be great pleasure in this, even if it is an\n  unedifying spectacle. Indeed, the narrator in Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel The Leopard remarks at one point that \u2018the intense pleasure of crying \u201cit\u2019s your\n  fault\u201d [is] the most powerful that the human creature is able to enjoy\u2019 (Il Gattopardo: 112). But the world, as such, is neither just nor unjust; it just is. This is\n  part of what Montaigne was getting at when he said one should not complain about undergoing something that could happen to anyone.\n\nApropos of the tendency to take out one\u2019s anger on others when one is ill, Samuel Johnson remarked: \u2018[D]isease produces much selfishness. A man in pain is looking after ease\u2019\n  (The Table Talk of Dr Johnson: 81). And it does indeed seem, as I have intimated, to be a natural reflex of the human mind to seek to discharge itself on others for its pains and\n  sufferings. In fact, it is arguable that much that passes for moral judgement is really this unpleasant human tendency decked out in fine-sounding words. Be that as it may, Johnson, who was ill for\n  much of his life \u2013 he once said that he had hardly known a pain-free day in his life \u2013 was exemplary in his capacity to resist the temptation to suppose that others were responsible for\n  his illnesses. There is a huge capacity in Johnson to cut through appearances and make us face the reality of our condition. For example, he once remarked to his friend Boswell that the latter was\n  forever complaining of being melancholy; this, he believed, showed that Boswell liked his mental suffering. No one, he said,\n\ntalks of that which he is desirous to conceal, and every man desires to conceal that of which he is ashamed . . . [M]ake it an . . . obligatory law to yourself never to\n      mention your own mental diseases; if you are never to speak of them, you will think on them but little; and if you think little of them, they will molest you rarely. When you talk of them, it\n      is plain that you want either praise or pity; for praise there is no room, and pity will do you no good; therefore . . . speak no more, think no more about them. (The Table Talk of Dr\n      Johnson: 81)\n\nThis is Johnson at his most stoical, and there is something almost frightening in his words, especially perhaps to modern-day readers, who live in an age proud of its\n  willingness to speak of mental sufferings. Of course, Johnson is speaking of mental suffering, but physical illness can often evoke mental suffering, so that the two become entangled. Again, none\n  of this is to suggest that we should forego treatment for physical illness \u2013 Johnson knew as well anyone that any reasonable person prefers health to sickness. The point is rather that we are\n  often surprisingly ready to burden others with talk of our illnesses, as Boswell burdened Johnson. Of course, we sometimes need help from friends when we are ill, and we do need to talk with them\n  about what we are experiencing, but the political theorist and philosopher Hannah Arendt was surely right when she said that\n\nwe can scarcely help raising the question of selflessness, or rather the question of openness to others, which in fact is the precondition for \u2018humanity\u2019 in\n      every sense of that word. It seems evident that sharing joy is absolutely superior in this respect to sharing suffering. Gladness, not sadness, is talkative, and truly human dialogue differs\n      from mere talk or even discussion in that it is entirely permeated by pleasure in the other person and what he says. It is tuned to the key of gladness, we might say. (\u2018On Humanity in\n      Dark Times: Thoughts About Lessing\u2019:15)\n\nPerhaps if we are ill, one of the things we most need is the gladness of friendship, and we need to seek to preserve our friendships in gladness, rather than a kind of sadness\n  which involves a concentration on the fact that we are ill. So I am inclined to say: if you are ill, seek comfort from your friends, but remember that it is gladness rather than sadness which best\n  nourishes you, your friend and your friendship. If you manage to laugh in and through your illness, that will probably help you.\n\nThe Will to Live\n\nSomeone who took this kind of thing to heart \u2013 I mean, the importance of gladness and laughter, with or without friends \u2013 is Norman Cousins. In his classic work\n  Anatomy of an Illness, Cousins describes how after a trip to the Soviet Union in 1964 he fell ill from a very rare, virtually untreatable and extremely serious collagen illness. Collagen\n  is the substance that binds cells together, and Cousins discovered that his collagen was breaking down. He was, as he put it, \u2018coming unstuck\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 33). He\n  had, he was told, a 1-in-500 chance of recovery. Reasoning that there was little the doctors could do for him, Cousins checked himself out of the hospital and into a hotel. He was well versed in\n  medical literature, and remembered having read about the idea that negative emotions could have a negative effect on the body. He wondered whether positive emotions might have a positive effect.\n  The question arose for him whether \u2018love, hope, faith, laughter, confidence, and the will to live have therapeutic value\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 38).\n\nCousins tried it out. He abandoned the standard treatment given to him by his doctors, believing on good evidence that this treatment would, in fact, do him more harm than good. He devised his\n  own interventions, such as administering to himself large amounts of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) since some medical reports indicated that certain patients suffering from collagen disease were\n  deficient in vitamin C. But he also devised a programme to cheer himself up, to make him laugh: he got hold of comic films, such as those by the Marx Brothers, and watched them. Incredibly, his\n  physical symptoms started to abate. Eventually he made a pretty full recovery.\n\nLaughing at duck soup rather than eating it might help you recover from illness.\n\nCousins grants that the vitamin C may have had purely a placebo effect. He is happy to accept this, because it supports his main point: he is convinced that \u2018the will to live is not a\n  theoretical abstraction, but a physiologic reality with therapeutic characteristics\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 49), so whether the vitamin C had any effect other than\n  encouraging him to think positively was neither here nor there. As evidence of the will to live, he presents not only his own case, but those of two other people: Pablo Casals, the great cellist,\n  and Albert Schweitzer, the theologian and medical missionary. He says that he learnt from them that \u2018a highly developed purpose and the will to live are among the prime raw materials of human\n  existence. I became convinced that these materials may well represent the most potent force within human reach\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 79).\n\nObviously, Cousins is in many ways an exception, not least because he was well-read on medical matters. Moreover, his aim is certainly not to dismiss the massive advances made by modern medical\n  science or to claim that we could do without them. Nor is he claiming that diseases such as his are caused by negative emotions or cured by positive ones. What he does believe, however, is that\n  immunity to illness can be reduced by distress and increased by good spirits. And he is surely right that we in the modern West are becoming hypersensitive to pain, leading us to take medicines in\n  an obsessive manner. He counsels a kind of healthy scepticism, so that we can \u2018steer an intelligent course between promiscuous pill-popping and irresponsible disregard of genuine\n  symptoms\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 101). That, of course, requires wisdom on our part. But, if Cousins is right, it also requires humour, an ability to laugh, and a kind of thirst or\n  hunger for life of the kind he saw in Casals and Schweitzer: \u2018creativity, the will to live, hope, faith, and love . . . contribute strongly to healing and well-being. The positive emotions\n  are life-giving experiences\u2019 (Anatomy of an Illness: 96). There is a lesson in that for all of us.",

      "content": "# 4. Dissolution; or, Adversity in Dying\n\nWhen I was about seventeen years old, my father, whose marriage to my mother had ended in divorce when I was nine, and who lived apart from us in the west of England, started\n  to suffer from various pains in his stomach. He had always eaten rather badly, and his doctor put him on a healthier, high-fibre diet, believing that his problems were temporary. He achieved some\n  brief respite, but the problems continued to get worse. With my younger brother, I visited my father for New Year\u2019s Eve, at which point he had been ill for some months. That evening, we sat\n  with him in the living room of his flat, overlooking the river. He told us that he was going to die. \u2018Well, boys, it looks as if I have something that\u2019s going to finish me off,\u2019\n  he said. These were his exact words, quite unforgettable in their devastating nonchalance. He had cancer. I have no idea what we said to him in reply. We were not, I think, terribly surprised, as\n  we had been expecting bad news. He went to bed early, and we were left there, looking blankly at each other as midnight approached and we waited for the new year. My father received no remedial\n  treatment for his illness, only palliative. He died in a hospice the following May. I remember feeling pleased for him that the spring weather was bright and warm, and that he had been able to\n  spend some time on the balcony outside his room before he died.\n\nMy father, like all human beings, had plenty of faults, but the way he approached his death struck me, even in my callow youth, as immensely impressive, and I still admire him enormously for his\n  calm, his stoicism and, in particular, his absence of self-pity as he faced the end of his life.\n\nIn 1784 Samuel Johnson lay dying, suffering from dropsy, now known as oedema, an abnormal accumulation of tissue fluid. He knew that he was going to die. The dropsy had spread from his chest to\n  his feet. He asked his surgeon, William Cruikshaw, to cut into his legs to drain them. One of Johnson\u2019s biographers, Walter Jackson Bate, continues:\n\nCruikshaw was afraid mortification might set in, and only gently lanced the surface. Johnson cried out: \u2018Deeper, deeper; I want length of life, and you are afraid of\n      giving me pain, which I do not value.\u2019 . . . Later, when no one was looking, Johnson managed to get hold of a pair of scissors in a drawer near the bed, and plunged them deeply into the\n      calves of each leg. The only result was a large effusion of blood . . . (Samuel Johnson: 598\u20139)\n\nLike my father, Johnson displayed no self-pity. But he was far from calm and his stoicism was of a quite different kind. Two deaths, quite different, yet similarly admirable.\n  There is no one good death, one good way to die. But this chapter looks at some of the thoughts that might help us face our own death, if not as nobly as my father and Johnson faced theirs, then at\n  least with a modicum of dignity. This chapter, then, is about finding some consolation in and for the fact of our mortality. It is about the possibility of finding a good death.\n\nSomeone Dies\n\nTolstoy\u2019s short story \u2018The Death of Ivan Ilyich\u2019 is one of the most powerful evocations of death one could imagine. In particular, Tolstoy brings out\n  magnificently two central features of death: firstly, the absolute terror we can face if we think about our own death; secondly, that we find it impossible actually to imagine our own death: death\n  is always, we like to think, something that happens to someone else. Tolstoy brings out Ivan\u2019s thought concerning the latter quite brilliantly. Ivan, we read, had never dissented\n  from those lessons in logic according to which we can deduce, from Julius Caesar\u2019s being a man and the fact that all men are mortal, the conclusion that Caesar is mortal. However, writes\n  Tolstoy, this\n\nhad always seemed to him to be true only when it applied to Caesar, certainly not to him. There was Caesar the man, and man in general, and it was fair enough for them, but\n      he wasn\u2019t Caesar the man and he wasn\u2019t man in general . . . Did Caesar have anything to do with the smell of that little striped leather ball that Vanya [Ivan] had loved so much?\n      Was it Caesar who had kissed his mother\u2019s hand like that, and was it for Caesar that the silken folds of his mother\u2019s dress had rustled in the way they did? (The Death of Ivan\n      Ilyich and Other Stories: 193)\n\nWhat is so marvellous in this passage is Tolstoy\u2019s capacity to bring out the kind of fierce attachment we have to our own experience and the way in which this cannot be\n  grasped from an outside perspective. There is clearly a sense in which, phenomenologically speaking, for each person, the only world that exists is his or her own world. Of course, I know that I\n  share the planet with countless other human beings and that the reality of the world far outstrips my experience of it. But, for the person who dies, what ends is not simply his world, but\n  the world. My world is the world because anything that wholly escapes my consciousness does not exist in my world and therefore is, for me, simply a blank. And when I say\n  that things exist that outstrip my consciousness, they exist, nonetheless, as things that surpass me in this way, in my experience of them as beyond me, in my knowledge and sense of them as such.\n  In this sense, they are not wholly unknown \u2013 they are mine as not known.\n\nMoreover, there is a sense in which I make my world. My values, needs, longings, hopes, fears, desires and so on all lead me to interpret the world in specific ways. Proust suggests\n  that each human being is a denizen of an unknown country, unique to him or her alone. In this life we are aware of this but cannot express what that world is, yet we see this world as we\n  do because of our provenance from elsewhere, from that unknown country. Only artists can express their world and, thanks to them, we are able to see this world in a new light. This is why we say\n  that certain novelists, playwrights and so on, create a world that we can enter.\n\nI am, of course, not making a moral judgement about individual egoism. I am, rather, seeking to capture a central aspect of how we each experience the world, that is, of the phenomenology of\n  experience. And it is, I think, when we compare our idea of our own death with our idea of someone else\u2019s that we become most acutely aware of the way in which, for each of us, everything\n  that exists does so in our world alone. If someone else dies, however much I care about or love that person, life goes on, the world continues to exist. If I die, then there is \u2013 nothing.\n\nHence the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein remarked, \u2018Death is not an event in life. We do not live to experience death\u2019 (Tractatus: 6.4311). It is not just that there is\n  nothing on the other side of death, but also that to try to imagine one\u2019s own death is always to imagine it from someone else\u2019s point of view. In a sense, Wittgenstein is saying that\n  dying is like falling asleep: there is nothing that one can describe, from the inside, because the experience of falling asleep is empty \u2013 unlike, say, the experience of exhaustedly\n  stretching out in bed to sleep. That moment at which sleep comes cannot be described from the inside. It is only when we wake up that it seems to be something, but that is an illusion.\n\nOf course, some people think that they will wake up after death. They think that after death life goes on \u2013 say, with God. I do not presuppose such a view here. And it is, I think, because\n  the end of my world is the end of the world that death is so terrifying.\n\n\u2018Death is Nothing to Us\u2019\n\nIn the ancient world, Epicurus and Lucretius picked up on the idea that the end of one\u2019s world is the end of the world to suggest that, after all, we should not fear\n  death. For, so the thought goes, when we are living, death is not present; and when we are dead, we do not exist to experience anything. So to suppose that death is bad for us, a misfortune, is to\n  suppose, mistakenly, that we would be around, but dead, to experience this misfortune. But this is obviously not so. Hence, it is said, there is nothing to fear in death because, once it is there,\n  we experience nothing. On this view, death is not a misfortune at all.\n\nNot many of those who have reflected on this argument have found it convincing. It has seemed to them that the problem is that death remains a misfortune after all because the argument overlooks\n  the deep attachment we have to our own experience of the kind that Tolstoy brings out. Even if it is true that I will not be around to experience my own death, death is still bad for me because\n  what I want is my experience, my state of experiencing the world, to continue. This does not mean that life can never be burdensome, or worse. But even if life is utterly terrible, death\n  can still be a misfortune \u2013 it is just the lesser of two evils, but still an evil.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that there is no consolation to be found in our mortality, or that we cannot face our death with good grace or nobility.\n\nDeath and Reality\n\nA friend of mine was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. During one conversation we had, she said something in particular that struck me powerfully. She said she felt a\n  certain relief in the diagnosis because it brought her face-to-face with reality. What she meant was that the fact of her possible death made real what before had merely been an abstract thought\n  for her \u2013 namely, that she is mortal. For, whilst it is true that we all know that we are mortal, we do not live in the light of that reality. It is a reality we suppress. We know it, but we\n  do not acknowledge it. My friend was forced to acknowledge it, to grasp her reality as a vulnerable human being destined to die. That contact with the reality of her existence was, for her, a form\n  of consolation. This is not the same as saying that she was not fearful in the face of death or that she wanted this illness, but it is to say that her contact with reality provided for her a sense\n  that here, now, in her life, was something that she had always known was there but had concealed from herself.\n\nA complementary way of looking at death is to be found in the reflections offered by Philip Gould, the Labour peer and strategist, who died of cancer in 2011. Gould wrote a book, When I\n  Die, and made a short film with Adrian Steirn under the same title, about his experience of being diagnosed with cancer and knowing his death was imminent. What emerges from his reflections is\n  the extremely powerful awareness that what helped him make sense of his experiences, indeed, find through them, in them, moments of joy and ecstasy, was his capacity to accept death, to face it as\n  his reality. \u2018[O]nly when you accept death,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018can you free yourself from it . . . Acceptance is the key\u2019. In the moment of acceptance, he said, \u2018you gain\n  freedom . . . power . . . courage\u2019 (When I Die: 118). Moreover, it is evident that what became important for Gould was a capacity to see not just the reality of his own situation but\n  that his impending death could reconcile him to the world. He said that he felt at one with the world and, as part of that, emphasized the continuity of life and death.\n\nThis comes out particularly in two things he said in the film. Standing in the place where his grave would be, he said that thinking about his death was not a gloomy thing at all and that\n  \u2018the community of the living and the dead\u2019, with people visiting his and others\u2019 graves, was a \u2018wonderful idea\u2019. Just as significant is the following comment: \u2018I\n  saw my children born . . . and I saw the incredible massive potential of that moment. And when my father died, and the air left his body, it was as powerful as the air entering the body of\n  my daughters.\u2019 What Gould invokes is the way in which death is of a piece with life, indeed, with the start of life: there is an acceptance here of the endlessly turning, ceaseless\n  cycle of all things natural, and the belief that only by accepting one\u2019s own place in this cycle can one be reconciled to death.\n\nWhy is it that this kind of acceptance enables one to be released from the fear of death? What is really going on here? The answer is, I think, this. We spend our entire existence in a state of\n  self-protection, self-defence. Everything we are by way of instinct, need and desire, leads us to seek our own security, the further progress of the self, the defence of what we are. The novelist\n  and philosopher Iris Murdoch spoke in this context of \u2018the fat relentless ego\u2019 (The Sovereignty of Good: 52), and she had in mind that everything we do \u2013 from organizing\n  our day as best we can for ourselves (work, leisure, holidays, projects and so on) to organizing our life more generally (career, marriage, children) \u2013 reflects and feeds from a kind of\n  unthinking egoistic self-concern. This is not to say we are all selfish: after all, your welfare can enter into what I identify as what I am, and seek to protect. Regard for another is not\n  disguised self-regard, but it is part of what one identifies as mattering to one and making one\u2019s life worth defending and securing. And what is going on in cases like that of Gould is that,\n  in the face of imminent death, this relentless self-concern drops away, because in such a situation there nothing left to defend. This means that the self can open out to the world and\n  accept it in a way that is otherwise very rarely possible. And this is a source of joy, not least because it is an immense relief. This is why Gould said that he had had more moments of happiness\n  and ecstasy in the last five months of his life than for many years before. Hence it is that, in a case like Gould\u2019s, a sense of the reality of the self, its mortality, and of the reality of\n  the world \u2013 really seeing the world, perhaps for the first time \u2013 come together. And this interconnection of reality, world and death, this sense that such a stance is\n  possible, is, I think, something that might help us face death with less fear and a sense that it can be something more than merely an unmitigated loss. It remains a misfortune, but we can learn\n  from cases such as that of Gould, and that of my friend, not to see it as only that.\n\nI think we can put the point this way. Because the concepts of reality, world and death come together as we recognize they do in the case of someone like Gould, we can see that death is actually\n  a central concept in our making sense of both ourselves and the world. In other words, and as many philosophers have said, our mortality is central to our capacity to make sense of the reality of\n  the world. If we were to become immortal we would lose a key element in whatever it is that can make life meaningful. For this reason, death is not simply something that stands at the end of life,\n  but is immanent in it. Our living involves, in this sense, the permanent presence of death. Living is dying and dying is living. This is why I have used the concept of dissolution for this\n  chapter: our life is a form of dissolution \u2013 that is, the process of dying \u2013 and finds its apotheosis in the moment of death itself. We are dying all the time. For this reason,\n  Heidegger said that we die, but the animals only perish, since they do not stand in the same relation to death as we do.\n\nBut this piece of knowledge about dissolution is something we suppress all the time because we are so fearful of death. What Gould makes us aware of is that we need to seek to live our life in\n  the light of this knowledge if we are to make sense of both our death and our life. Usually we can only do this, if at all, towards the end. But what he encourages us to do is not to wait until\n  then. If we can do that, we shall perhaps feel less fear of death.\n\nOf course, this is, inevitably, something that we can do only partially, at best: the knowledge in question will wax and wane even in those who are most acutely conscious of it. Nonetheless,\n  there are moments for some people when they are confronted by the reality of death and then they experience life as Gould did. For example, a friend of mine was told when she was twenty-three years\n  old that she had cancer. The terror this engendered in her was accompanied by an acute sense of life in all its magnificent richness: the blue of the sky, the song of the birds and so on. She told\n  me that she had the thought that she must retain this sense, come what may. In fact, the diagnosis was mistaken. But even now, years later, she sometimes thinks of that moment, aware that she\n  learnt something vital then, and sorry that she cannot always see life as she did for that brief period. But if you have had a similar experience you might be able to mobilize the thoughts and\n  feelings in question to give you a heightened sense of life precisely because you have a heightened sense of death \u2013 and vice versa.\n\nRegrets\n\nIn a way, Gould was lucky: he died surrounded by people he loved and who loved him, and in material comfort, with doctors to advise and care for him, and in pain but not always\n  so much pain as to make him, for example, incapable of thought or reflection. Moreover, he was in his sixties when he died, not especially young, and had led a full and active life.\n\nBut someone who discovers or believes he is going to die might be in a quite different situation: if he is young, he might be especially struck by a sense of waste, of missed opportunities, or,\n  whether young or not, he may feel that he has made a mess of his life and be filled with painful regrets at this thought. Indeed, the latter is the case with Ivan Ilyich, who comes to see, as he\n  lies dying, that he has lived a lie, that his life has been all wrong. At first he is filled with horror, regret and terror. But even in this case, Ivan finds consolation: his impending death has\n  forced him to be honest with himself about his life for the first time. He finally grasps that he has lived a life wholly in the eyes of others, accepting their judgements of value and taste\n  without ever questioning whether they were really his judgements about things. His life has been devoid of depth, of serious reflection and of insight into his own condition. He has never\n  given any heed to that maxim of the Delphic oracle: \u2018Know thyself\u2019. When he finally sees that this is so, he has the consolation that he has at least some insight into the reality of\n  his life.\n\nThe sense of regret at the prospect of death comes over very strongly in something that Primo Levi says in his book The Periodic Table. After his arrest by the fascists and before his\n  deportation to Auschwitz, he was held in a cell and interrogated. He believed that he was going to be killed at the end of the interrogations. He writes:\n\nLife can hit you with all its force when you are acutely aware of your mortality.\n\nIn those days in which I waited for death fairly courageously I harboured a piercing desire for everything, for all conceivable human experiences, and I cursed my life up\n      until then, which, so it seemed to me, I had exploited too little and badly, and I felt time pouring through my fingers, slipping away from my body minute by minute, like a haemorrhage which\n      cannot be stopped. (Il sistema periodico: 141)\n\nLevi was at the time only in his early twenties and was, by his own account, a rather shy and awkward young man, somewhat naive and intimidated by the world. But whatever his\n  regrets might have been, he bore the thought of his imminent death with great courage and dignity. This is clear not so much from what he says as the manner in which he says it \u2013 the\n  tone, the style of his writing, which has always impressed his readers as immensely sober and judicious. And there is a very important point here for us if we wish to think about\n  our own attitude to death and how we might find something valuable or worthwhile in our mortality. This is that here, as in many other places in life, it really is a matter less of what\n  one does than of how one does it. No one else can die my death for me. It is an event which marks one\u2019s absolute solitude or loneliness, for, however much help one might have by way\n  of palliative care or the like, death is something that has to be faced alone in a very radical sense. It is partly this that makes it so frightening. And in this we see the extraordinary equality\n  of all human beings, together with the uniqueness of each human death: we all die, but we each die our own death. To confront one\u2019s own death, one needs to find one\u2019s own way,\n  one\u2019s own style, as it were, and for that there can be no formulae \u2013 though it can be helpful to see how others have confronted their death.\n\nIs Death the Worst that Can Befall Us?\n\nIn any case, what Levi came to realize is that there are things worse than death, and this very thought can be helpful to us in facing our own demise.\n\nLevi was well aware that the ancient philosophers were much preoccupied with death and the fear of death. They thought that central to virtue was a kind of contempt for death, and they even\n  conceived of the practice of philosophy as a preparation for death, since it requires a kind of contemplation disassociated from the body, which thus resembles death and is a kind of preparation\n  for it.\n\nMontaigne summed up much of this wisdom on overcoming the fear of death in his essay \u2018To philosophize is to learn how to die\u2019, pointing out the many different ways in which death can\n  carry us off \u2013 one example he gives is that of his own brother, who was struck by a ball just above the right ear whilst playing tennis, and \u2018five or six hours after . . . died from an\n  apoplexy caused by the blow\u2019\u2013 in order to remind us that we can die at pretty much any moment and thus have to prepare ourselves for it.\n\nHe offers a number of suggestions. We should, he says, deprive death of its strangeness by thinking about it often, including when we are enjoying ourselves, and he writes approvingly of the\n  ancient Egyptians, who \u2018in the midst of their banquets and celebrations . . . would bring a skeleton in to serve as a warning to their guests\u2019. He tells us also that we should, like\n  him, when we are reading or chatting to people, find out how different individuals died, in order to model ourselves on those who died well. \u2018Whoever taught men how to die would teach them\n  how to live\u2019, he comments in his typically laconic manner. What Montaigne has in mind is the idea we have already encountered that life itself is deeply bound up with death, in the sense that\n  the whole of life is a progression towards death. \u2018[The] being which you enjoy is a part equally of death and life,\u2019 he writes, and forms part of the \u2018interweaving of\n  things\u2019 in nature. Because we are always dying whilst alive, all \u2018that you live, you rob from life, living at her expense\u2019 (\u2018Que philosopher, c\u2019est apprendre\n  \u00e0 mourir\u2019: 131\u2013138). We should see ourselves, Montaigne suggests, as part of the cycle of life and death, and be willing to relinquish gracefully what has only been loaned\n  to us, so to speak. He also suggests that we should try to view our individual lives from the perspective of eternity. Consider, he says, those tiny creatures which live for one day: it makes no\n  difference from our perspective if one such creature dies at eight in the morning or at five in the afternoon and, similarly, from the perspective of infinity it makes no difference if we live a\n  long or short life.\n\nNot everyone will find any or all of these arguments useful in seeking to find consolation in the face of death. But I would certainly recommend reflection on them to see if you might find them\n  of help. Levi, however, as I intimated earlier, rejected the idea that the proper object of philosophical reflection should be death. In his book If This is a Man, he speaks of \u2018the\n  demolition of a man\u2019 that went on in Auschwitz: the reduction of human beings to the state or level of animals, as he put it, a procedure that was carried out by depriving the prisoners of\n  all their possessions, stripping them naked, making them defecate and urinate in public, shaving them, and replacing their names with numbers. Levi spoke of this as the destruction of the\n  personality and, amazed at how quickly and easily such destruction can take place, he wrote that\n\nour personality is fragile, and much more in danger than our life; and the ancient sages, instead of admonishing us to \u2018remember that you must die\u2019 would have\n      done better to remind us of this greater danger that menaces us. (Se questo \u00e8 un uomo: 48)\n\nMontaigne thought that one of the central reasons to fear death was that everyone is subject to it, whereas other misfortunes are not in this way inevitable. And he is, of\n  course, right about that. Given that this is so, we might well side with Montaigne and seek consolation for our mortality in the kind of way he suggests. But we might think, otherwise, that\n  Levi\u2019s point provides consolation for our mortality precisely because we come to see that it is not the worst that can befall us, even if it is inevitable \u2013 as the destruction of the\n  personality, thankfully, is not. We might, that is to say, be able to face death better if we see that a worse fate has not afflicted us in our lives, find gratitude in ourselves to life for that\n  and hence see death as something to be feared less. At any rate, Levi\u2019s thought, or what I have derived from it, joins hands here with Montaigne, since the latter suggests that if we have had\n  a good life we should seek to be grateful for this and leave life as we leave a feast \u2013 replete and satisfied. And, Montaigne goes on, \u2018if you have never learned how to use life, if\n  life is useless to you, what does it matter to you if you have lost it?\u2019 \u2013 that is, if you die? (Que philosopher, c\u2019est apprendre \u00e0 mourir: 139). If, as Hume\n  suggested, we all have a tendency to \u2018complain at once of the shortness of life, and of its vanity and sorrow\u2019 \u2013 \u2018such is the greatness of human misery, it reconciles even\n  contradictions\u2019, he remarks tersely (Dialogues and Natural History of Religion: 100) \u2013 then what, in their different ways, Levi and Montaigne are seeking to do is to break us\n  of this contradiction by helping us to be grateful for what we have and for this very reason better able to let it go when the time comes. The solution to death is found in how one lives.\n\nMeditating upon death may well take from us some of our fear of it.\n\nDeath and the Act of Dying\n\nI have so far not clearly distinguished death itself, the fact of being dead, from the process or act of dying \u2013 the physical collapse of the body. But the distinction is\n  important because it is possible to fear one and not the other. Simone de Beauvoir, for example, in her book about her mother\u2019s last months, A Very Easy Death, reports at one point\n  the demeanour of both her maternal grandmother and her father in the face of death. \u2018My grandmother,\u2019 she writes,\n\nwas aware that she was dying. She said quite happily: \u2018I am going to eat a last little boiled egg, and then I shall go to rejoin Gustave.\u2019 She had never put much\n      energy into living. At the age of eighty-four, she vegetated morosely: dying did not disturb her. (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 107\u20138)\n\nAnd of her father she writes that,\n\n[he] did not show less courage. \u2018Ask your mother to send no priest. I don\u2019t want to play a comedy,\u2019 he said to me. And he gave me certain instructions on\n      practical matters. Financially ruined, bitter, he accepted nothingness as serenely as grandmother accepted paradise. (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 108)\n\nNo doubt both of these people had reasons to accept death as they did, reasons to do with the compromised nature of their individual lives. But, of course, everyone\u2019s\n  life is compromised in some way and, moreover, de Beauvoir saw them both as courageous. Like Philip Gould, they were not frightened of death, of the state of being dead. So a question we must ask\n  ourselves is whether we are frightened of death itself or only the act of dying. Without being honest with ourselves about that, we cannot, I think, begin to cope with the fear in question. We each\n  have to reflect on this for ourselves.\n\nDe Beauvoir\u2019s mother, who died of cancer, was frightened of both death and dying. Yet, despite her Catholic faith, she did not seek the aid of a priest during her terrible illness, and she\n  did not pray, something which is to be explained, says de Beauvoir, by the fact that, for her, prayer was \u2018an exercise that demanded attention and reflection, a certain state of the\n  soul\u2019 (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 107), and it would therefore have exhausted her. De Beauvoir continues:\n\nShe knew what she should have said to God: \u2018Heal me. But thy will be done: I accept death.\u2019 But she did not accept it. In this moment of truth, she did not want\n      to utter insincere words. Nonetheless, she did not grant herself the right to rebel. She remained silent: \u2018God is good.\u2019 . . . In any case, Mother feared neither God nor the devil:\n      simply leaving the world. (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 107)\n\nBut even she had moments of \u2018joy\u2019 and, at times, was \u2018at peace with herself\u2019, finding, \u2018on this death bed, a kind of happiness\u2019 (Une\n  mort tr\u00e8s douce: 71). This is not to suggest that she did not suffer terribly. It is simply to insist that, despite that suffering, she found something in the process of dying that was\n  positive. In her case, this was because, says de Beauvoir, for the first time in her life, she really gave herself over, without scruple, to her desires and to pleasure.\n\nNone of this is to deny that many die awful, wretched deaths, even in developed, affluent parts of the world with good medical services. But it is to say that, if we are lucky, and if we open\n  ourselves to this possibility, even the process of dying can give us something. I am sure that central to that luck is the love or friendship of others. In death, as I mentioned earlier, we are\n  alone, but the affections of others can do something to mitigate that.\n\nIn considering why her mother\u2019s faith could not console her for her death, de Beauvoir compares the immortality that religion might offer and that offered by her own fame from being a\n  writer. She says: \u2018Religion could do no more for my mother than could the hope of posthumous success for me. Whether one imagines it as celestial or terrestrial, immortality does not console\n  one for death if one is attached to life\u2019 (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 108). The point here is that immortality as offered by religion is, whatever else it is, not the same as\n  immortality here on earth, and for some religious believers it may precisely be the latter that they want \u2013 or, if not immortality, at least more life here below. And of course a non-believer\n  might want that too. Woody Allen made much the same point in his typically droll manner when he remarked: \u2018I don\u2019t want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve\n  immortality through not dying\u2019. And when he was asked if he would like to live on in the hearts of others, he replied: \u2018I would like to live on in my apartment\u2019 (The\n  Illustrated Woody Allen Reader: 250; 259).\n\nBut it may be a matter of temperament whether one finds consolation after all in the way in which the dead can live on in the hearts of others. One of the things that makes such a thought more\n  difficult for those in the modern age is the way in which death has been stripped of much of its ritual quality and removed to the edges of our lives: death is not a permanent presence for us, as\n  it was for those of previous ages. We have created a world in which death has no place. De Beauvoir brings this out forcefully when she reflects on the things she sees in the shop windows whilst\n  her mother lies dying in a clinic:\n\nPerfumes, furs, lingerie, jewels: luxurious arrogance of a world where death does not have its place. But it is crouching behind this fa\u00e7ade, in the secret greyness\n      of clinics, hospitals, closed rooms. And I no longer know any other truth. (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 92)\n\nWe are in denial most of the time about death, which is one of the reasons why those, like Gould, who have written about their own experience of dying stress again and again\n  the importance of being honest with themselves that this is what is happening \u2013 that they are dying. Such honesty does not defeat death, but, Gould says, it does provide freedom from it. Ivan\n  too, in Tolstoy\u2019s story, only becomes free when he finally acknowledges that he is dying and that there is nothing he can do to change that.\n\nIn any case, there is a sense in which the dead live on, though I do not mean this in any superstitious or literal way. I know, for example, that my father \u2013 what he did and how\n  he lived his life, for good and ill \u2013 is often present to me in my thoughts and feelings, and I seek still to learn from the manner in which he lived. In Thoughts on Happiness Alain\n  writes, that\n\n[t]he dead are not dead, which is clear enough, since we live. The dead think, speak and act; they can advise, desire, approve, blame. All that is true. But it is necessary\n      to hear it. All that is in us; all that is really alive in us. (Propos sur le bonheur: 143)\n\nAs Alain says, visiting the graves of the dead can, if we listen carefully, return us to life, because the dead have much to say to us. And, we may add, there is little doubt\n  that the dead more generally, including those one has never known, can play a large part in one\u2019s inner life, in one\u2019s thoughts and feelings. Through books, films, photographs, music\n  and so on, they speak to us, if only we listen carefully. In an interview, the writer W. G. Sebald was happy to be called a \u2018ghost hunter\u2019, and his work expresses very finely the\n  attempt to listen carefully to the dead. As he says: \u2018I have always had at the back of my mind this notion that . . . these people [the dead] aren\u2019t really gone, they just hover\n  somewhere at the perimeter of our lives and keep coming in on brief visits\u2019 (\u2018Ghost Hunter\u2019: 39). In his writings, Sebald teaches us how we might listen. As he says in another\n  interview:\n\nThe attitude for which I strive \u2013 and this is something that one has to learn \u2013 is an attitude of mourning. Not in any sentimental sense, but rather the full\n      awareness that one is seeing something that is disappearing: a body, a society, a state, a part of nature or whatever. (\u2018Eine Trauerhaltung lernen\u2019: 115)\n\nAlthough, of course, Sebald is speaking here of more than individual human beings, it is clear that we can apply what he says more narrowly to those who are dead. His writings\n  seek, as I have said, to make us attentive. They do so because they are infinitely focused, with a kind of grieving love, on the details of individual lives and on what the people in question made\n  of them. The fact that Sebald himself died in 2001, adds to what we can learn from him: he is a ghost speaking of ghosts, a dead writer who speaks of death, and in this way he invites us to be less\n  frightened of death by drawing us towards seeing our own death as part of an inevitable cycle of things that has its own melancholy beauty.\n\nAs I say, it may be a matter of temperament whether these kinds of reflections can console us in, and for, our own death. But if you find consolation in them, it might be that you can also find\n  such, as Gould suggests, in a sense of community with those already dead. To die is to enter into the realm of those who have already died, as if one were now to join them. At any rate, I find\n  something consoling in that thought. Most of the men and women I admire are dead, and I have the sense that, when I die, I shall join them, not in any literal way, but simply in the sense that then\n  I shall be numbered amongst them. And I am not alone in having some such a sense of things. De Beauvoir, in her account of her mother\u2019s illness and death, tells of the funeral. Sitting with\n  her sister in the hearse, she looked at the coffin in which their mother\u2019s body was laid. De Beauvoir reports what her sister said and then makes a comment:\n\n\u2018The only thing that consoles me,\u2019 she said to me, \u2018is that I too will go that way. Without that, it would be too unfair!\u2019 Yes. We were taking part\n      in the dress rehearsal for our own burial. (Une mort tr\u00e8s douce: 117)\n\nDe Beauvoir\u2019s sister\u2019s sentiment may not have been exactly the same as my sense of joining the dead, but it certainly expresses a kind of solidarity or community\n  with the dead. It expresses a similar sense of going to join the dead, and clearly her sister thought of this in terms of a kind of justice. I do not know whether that made her better able to\n  confront her own mortality and integrate it more seamlessly into her life, but it certainly opens up such a possibility.\n\nMy sense about these things is also this: those men and women I admire, and who have died, have managed to achieve something \u2013 precisely, their death. And that gives me a powerful feeling\n  that, if they were able to do this, so can I. I have the sense that it cannot be as bad as all that if they have done it. I think here of all the times in my life when I have been\n  frightened by some difficult challenge and, in the end, things turned out to be easier than I had imagined. I am always surprised at how resilient human beings are when things are very difficult.\n  Gould says of his cancer treatment that before it began he thought he would simply be unable to cope with it. But cope with it he did. And then he was told that he would never eat normally, and he\n  got used to that too. \u2018Then you realise \u2013 whatever they throw at you, you can deal with it\u2019. He managed to cope even with his \u2018[e]ndless, endless pain\u2019 (When I\n  Die: 121; 122). He did not in any sense value his pain, and he wanted it reduced as much as possible, but it did, he says, give him a sense that now, for the first time he understood what pain\n  was, and therefore could understand the pain of others. To that extent, it clearly opened him to the world.\n\nChanging Attitudes\n\nIn the modern bourgeois world we place an enormous emphasis upon the security of the individual. This has no doubt brought many benefits, but it has, along with other things,\n  such as secularization and the advance of medical science, also unquestionably made us much more intolerant of pain than those of previous ages were. It has also made us more fearful of death. In\n  his essay \u2018On the Fear of Death\u2019, William Hazlitt was scathing about this aspect of modern life. Speaking of the tendency to cling to life as such in our modern, civilized world, he\n  comments that in the past people threw themselves\n\ninto all the vicissitudes and dangers of war, or staked their all upon a single die, or some one passion, which if they could not have gratified, life became a burden to\n      them \u2013 now our strongest passion is to think, our chief amusement is to read new plays, new poems, new novels, and this we may do at our leisure, in perfect security . . . A life of\n      action and danger moderates the dread of death. It not only gives us fortitude to bear pain, but teaches us at every step the precarious tenure on which we hold our present being. (\u2018On\n      the Fear of Death\u2019: 479\u201380)\n\nThe complaint is, as J. P. Stern put it when discussing some aspects of the modern condition, that we live in an age of the \u2018atrophy of the heart and the dulling of the\n  senses[,] in a world where conformism and commerce, the civil service and bourgeois taboos, have taken the place of heroism and adventure\u2019 (Idylls and Realities: 37). Of course,\n  death was feared in the past, but security was not considered to be of supreme value. Death itself, in the pursuit of some good, could be seen as something deeply worthy. We do not see things this\n  way, not even when we feel that it might be better to die than to live, as in cases of acute and pointless pain. Even when we speak of heroic deaths, as in war or in other acts of courage or\n  valour, we see such death as an exception that confirms our general attitude. We have very little understanding of what Nietzsche called, in a striking phrase, \u2018der verschwenderische\n  Geist\u2019, the squandering spirit. Because we place so much emphasis on individual security, we no longer really understand those characters from the past who squandered themselves by\n  living at the limits of their capacities, pushing themselves to the point where they risked destroying themselves, not least because they often risked destroying others in the process. One good\n  example, to which I have already referred, is that given by Antony and Cleopatra in their magnificent egoism. The writings of the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig are replete with examples \u2013\n  indeed, his work is in many ways a kind of lament for the loss of such figures, or their increasingly rare occurrence in the modern world: Magellan, Balzac, Casanova, among others.\n\nOf course, one must not exaggerate, and there are modern exceptions, in the arts or sport, but even here the bureaucratization of existence has made such inroads that these areas of life have\n  become massively over-professionalized and regulated. It would be a romantic fantasy to suppose that we could go back to living as earlier ages did. Nonetheless, in Nietzsche\u2019s idea of the\n  squandering spirit there is a lesson in how to think productively about death, and with less fear. For it is open to us to see our life much more in terms of a kind of venture or quest than we\n  often do. Focused on making our external lives as secure as possible, we forget that we can make our inner life a scene of the most extraordinary adventure, and that we can challenge ourselves much\n  more than we suppose we can. Our inner life can be much more like the kind Hazlitt imagined, a life of action and danger. We effectively smother such a possibility by our relentless desire for\n  happiness and our deep incapacity to accept suffering \u2013 melancholy, disappointment, loss and so on \u2013 as completely and utterly normal, by our secret \u2013 and sometimes not so secret\n  \u2013 suspicion, or fantasy, that these things have no real place in the world. A quite different possibility, more in line with Hazlitt\u2019s view, is well articulated by the opening passage\n  of Hermann Hesse\u2019s novel Gertrude:\n\nWhen I look back across my life from the outside, it does not seem especially happy. Nonetheless, I can with even less justice call it unhappy, despite all the errors. It is\n      in the end also quite foolish to ask about happiness and unhappiness, for it seems to me that I would give up the unhappiest days of my life with more difficulty than all the cheerful ones. If\n      in a human life the task is to accept the inevitable clearsightedly, to suffer good and evil fully, and to conquer an inner, more authentic, non-contingent destiny next to one\u2019s external\n      destiny, then my life has been neither poor nor bad. If my external destiny has passed over me as over all other people, inevitably and as decreed by the gods, nonetheless my inner destiny has\n      been my own work, whose sweetness or bitterness is mine, and for which I consider that I alone should accept the responsibility. (Gertrud: 7)\n\nWe are back to the sense of the immanence of death in life. For, if you manage to see your life in the way Hesse expresses, you might be able to see your death not as something\n  dreadful that stands at the end of your life, but rather as something that you have earned, worked for, something that is worthy of you. Whether it arrives suddenly or slowly, your death could be\n  something that you make fully your own because you see it as being at one with your life, as being something that you live each day, just as you make yours the rest of what happens to you\n  by carving out of it an inner destiny parallel to your external destiny. To that extent, as I suggested earlier, the fact that we are mortal is central to the meaning we can find in life.\n\nWittgenstein recommended to his pupils that they \u2018go the bloody hard way\u2019, by which he meant that philosophy should never be a mere intellectual or academic pursuit but should be\n  bound up with one\u2019s whole being, so that it helps one see what one really thinks and not simply what one thinks one thinks because it is convenient or fashionable\n  or impressive or useful for career purposes. I am suggesting that there is something in what Wittgenstein says for life more generally. What matters is much less the length of your life than the\n  spirit in which you live it. The struggle to live in a spirit of integrity is also a struggle to see one\u2019s mortality for what it is, to live one\u2019s mortality, precisely because\n  it is inevitable and, as part of our external destiny, needs to be made one\u2019s own in the inner life.\n\nThis is the deepest lesson that Tolstoy\u2019s Ivan Ilyich has to teach us: his living a lie was his living without integrity, without really making anything his own, and it was\n  precisely for this reason that he was so terrified of death. Being an individual is not so much a matter of doing what others have not done or do not do, as it is a matter of doing it in a spirit\n  expressive of your whole being. If you do this, then, as Gould says, you do not beat death; but death cannot beat you.",

      "content": "# Some Final Thoughts\n\nI have tried in this book to offer some productive ways to think about adversity in four different contexts. In these few final comments I should like to draw out and make\n  explicit one or two general points that I see running through the discussions. In doing so, I offer a couple of further suggestions for thinking about adversity.\n\nScepticism\n\nIt is important, I think, if you want to make sense of the adversity in your life to seek to be sceptical. This means a number of things. In part it is a matter of acknowledging\n  that there are many things you do not know \u2013 far more than you do know \u2013 about the human condition. Life is deeply mysterious, and the motives that human beings have for doing what they\n  do are often deeply obscure to everyone, including the individual concerned. Do not fight this mystery; seek to live it. Try to give others, and yourself, the benefit of the doubt. Judge,\n  if at all, coolly and after reflection.\n\nBeing sceptical is also a matter of your relation to what you do believe. You can hold your opinions in a kind of tentative fashion. The truth is that the position we tend to adopt automatically\n  when we have an opinion is that we know. Hence the Franco-Romanian philosopher E. M. Cioran said in his book A Short History of Decay that \u2018man is the dogmatic being par\n  excellence\u2019 (Pr\u00e9cis de d\u00e9composition: 88). The advantage of being sceptical is that it helps to undercut adversity, both in oneself and with others. As Cioran points\n  out, history is a scene of such relentless suffering inflicted by human beings on themselves and on each other because \u2013 or, at any rate, largely because \u2013 there have been endless\n  individuals who were sure they knew the truth and sought to get others to agree with them. For those who feel sure they have the answers are usually pretty keen to impose them on others. I would\n  add to this the point I made in the Introduction, that human beings are ontological misfits: the claim that one knows the truth is invariably an attempt to conceal from oneself one\u2019s\n  ontological insecurity, by making it seem that one has the stability of truth \u2013 that one is not insecure after all. If we were at home in the world we would not experience or create adversity\n  as we do.\n\nAnd it is not only at the large, historical level that scepticism might be helpful. In interpersonal relationships scepticism helps to reduce adversity, because it means that one is much more\n  willing to be open to the other\u2019s point of view. It can help also with the attainment of individual inner peace, since it encourages a kind of cheerful tolerance in the face of\n  disagreement.\n\nOf course, it is immensely hard to put such scepticism into practice. But if you can mobilize it in yourself, even only occasionally or haltingly, you will have done much to reduce the incidence\n  of adversity in your life.\n\nWeakness\n\nSo do not fight your vulnerability, your weakness. Meditate on it and seek to incorporate it consciously in your life. Ancient thinkers such as Marcus Aurelius and\n  Seneca recommended that, in order to cope with life\u2019s adversities, we should practise for them in advance, through thought experiments. The key is to acknowledge that bad things will happen\n  to you because that is just the way life is, and to meditate on them, so that if and when they arrive you will be able to cope better. Hence Seneca writes:\n\nFor by looking ahead to all [the bad] that may happen as though it were going to happen, [you] . . . will soften the attacks of all ills, which bring nothing unforeseen to\n      those who are prepared and expectant, but come as a serious blow to those who . . . expect only blessings. (\u2018On the Tranquillity of the Mind\u2019: 130)\n\nImagine yourself in various situations of adversity and ask yourself how you could most constructively react in them, to them. If you do this, you will have a good chance of\n  coming somewhat more prepared to them and may make less of a mess of them than you otherwise would, because you will have acknowledged your weakness from the first.] I also find it helpful\n  sometimes to imagine that a wise and generous but rigorous person is accompanying me through the day. Montaigne is my favourite, because he is so phenomenally well-balanced. And when I am about to\n  get angry or frustrated, I imagine what he would say to me, and I invariably find that this helps to put my feelings into perspective and allows me to get a grip on them and remain calmer.\n  Thinking, too, about how self-indulgent it is to get worked up about some small issue, as I sometimes do, in a world \u2018bursting with sin and sorrow\u2019, as Johnson put it, and in which I\n  have been spared the worst forms of suffering that have taken place and are taking place right now, also helps, I find.\n\nPleasure\n\nThe other side of the coin is this: cope with adversity by seeking out those things in life that give you pleasure and a sense of peace. Seneca advises us to go for walks, to\n  drink wine, and in general to show kindness to ourselves \u2013 for it is surprising how hard it often is to be kind to oneself. Montaigne too advises this. Nietzsche as well, who tells us we\n  should think each morning of something pleasant we can do during the day, not least to help us deal successfully with any adversity we may encounter. It is important to be rigorously realistic with\n  oneself, but it is also important to find good things in life. And Montaigne suggests, in his essay \u2018On diversion\u2019, that, if we are assailed by painful or difficult thoughts, we should\n  divert the mind:\n\n[S]ome distressing idea gets hold of me; I find it quicker to change it than to subdue it. If I cannot replace it with an opposite one, I find at least a different one.\n      Change is always a solace, dissolves the idea and dispels it. If I cannot fight it, I flee it. (\u2018De la diversion\u2019: 51)\n\nOne can do this for others too. Montaigne tells us that he once had to console a lady who was feeling distressed. Instead of seeking to show her that her distress was not\n  justified and directly confronting her suffering, he spoke to her about her feelings and then gradually took the conversation away to other things. And, he says, \u2018I kept her composed and\n  totally calm as long as I was there\u2019 (\u2018De la diversion\u2019: 47).\n\nUrbanity\n\nI think we might sum up these thoughts by invoking the notion of urbanity. For to be urbane is, in one of its aspects, to be able to laugh ironically and good-heartedly at human\n  foolishness, including one\u2019s own. Seneca makes this point when he reminds us that we all get moments in which we are filled with hatred or disgust for the human race. Or, as G. K. Chesterton\n  has it: \u2018Every man has hated humanity . . . Every man has had humanity in his nostrils like a suffocating smell\u2019 (Heretics: 185). And Seneca\u2019s advice is that we should,\n  when in this mood, try to find human beings not hateful but ludicrous.\n\nAnother way to express this would be to remind ourselves of the wonderful comment by Chremes, a character in The Self-Tormentor, one of the plays of the Roman playwright Terence \u2013\n  it was actually one of the classical quotations that Montaigne had inscribed on a beam in his study: \u2018I am a human being and I consider nothing human alien to me\u2019.\n\nRunning through this book have been two key ideas. Firstly, I have wanted to bring out the way in which forms of adversity \u2013 ambivalence, incomprehension, vulnerability and dissolution\n  \u2013 are also things for which we can be grateful. We could not become adults without experiencing feelings of ambivalence, so they are to be welcomed on that account; we would not find\n  anyone erotically appealing if we fully understood him or her, and to that extent incomprehension is valuable; we could not enjoy the delights of the body, unless we could also fall ill, and so we\n  have reason to cherish our vulnerability; and we would find little or no meaning in our lives if we were immortal, and so our dissolution, the process of dying that is with us all our lives and\n  finally ends in our death, is not wholly an unwelcome intruder into our lives. As Hume writes:\n\nGood and ill are universally intermingled and confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is purely and entirely of a piece. All advantages\n      are attended with disadvantages. An universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence. And it is not possible for us, by our most chimerical wishes, to form the idea of a\n      station or situation altogether desirable. (Dialogues and Natural History of Religion: 183)\n\nAdversity is inevitable. We must accept that, and not fight or regret it all the time. We should also remember that it can bring good things.\n\nThe second key idea in this book, related to the first, is that not despite but on account of all the mistakes you have made in your life, and not despite but because of all the forms of\n  adversity that you have experienced and had to cope with, have confronted well or made a mess of, the life you have lived and are living has given you a unique insight into your condition and the\n  human condition more generally. The adversity in your life has been a precious source of enlightenment. You will face more adversity. As you do, you should seek not simply to cope with it as\n  constructively as possible, turning it to account, but also remember that it is giving you an understanding of things that is irreplaceably valuable. It is part of your inheritance as a human being\n  \u2013 and you should seek not to consider it alien to you.",

      "content": "# Homework\n\nIn addition to the books I have discussed in the main body of the text, and amongst the many things that could be studied with profit, I would recommend the following relevant\n  works.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPierre Hadot\u2019s Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 1995), tr. Michael Chase, ed. and intro.\n  Arnold Davidson, provides both an introduction to philosophy and makes a case for the therapeutic value of philosophical reflection.\n\n1. Ambivalence; or, Adversity in the Family\n\nJulia Blackburn\u2019s The Three of Us (London: Jonathan Cape, 2008) provides many insights into the nature of a deeply fractured family from the point of view of the\n  child. A painful but fascinating read.\n\nA useful introduction to Melanie Klein\u2019s thinking, with references, is Hanna Segal\u2019s Melanie Klein (New York: Viking Press, 1979).\n\nYasujiro Ozu\u2019s film Tokyo Story (1953) is a mercilessly insightful dissection of relations between parents and children.\n\n2. Incomprehension; or, Adversity in Love\n\nSimon May\u2019s Love: a History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012) provides a good survey of some of the varying attitudes towards love in the Western\n  tradition.\n\nPhilosophies of Love (Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 1971), eds David L. Norton and Mary F. Kille is a really useful anthology, containing extracts from key philosophers on\n  the different kinds of love.\n\nIrving Singer has written extensively on love from a philosophical point of view. His Philosophy of Love: a Partial Summing-Up (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009) is a good place to\n  start.\n\nFive interesting case studies from psychoanalysis exploring some of the difficulties of intimate relations are to be found in Deborah Luepnitz\u2019s Schopenhauer\u2019s Porcupines:\n  Intimacy and its Dilemmas (New York: Basic Books, 2002).\n\nC. S. Lewis\u2019s The Four Loves (London: HarperCollins, 2012) has some stimulating things to say about different kinds of love. His idea that one of the functions of eros is to play\n  the buffoon in our lives has the ring of truth about it.\n\nJonathan Lear\u2019s Love and its Place in Nature (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998) explores its theme from a psychoanalytic point of view.\n\nLove, Sex and Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes Our Lives (London: John Murray, 2004) by Simon Goldhill is a thoroughly enjoyable read which relates the modern and ancient worlds in\n  order to enlighten us about our condition.\n\nCaroline J. Simon\u2019s The Disciplined Heart (Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans, 1997) discusses love in various contexts from a philosophical and theological point of\n  view, helpfully exploring many literary examples.\n\nAmongst filmmakers, I would especially recommend the work of Michelangelo Antonioni as a director who explores insightfully problems of erotic love in modernity. His L\u2019Avventura\n  (1960) is a masterpiece. Pretty much most of Eric Rohmer\u2019s films deal with the same issue, in a quite different way. His early Ma nuit chez Maud (1969) is still as pertinent now as\n  when it was made. And Woody Allen has much to say on modern love that is helpful. My favourite is probably Hannah and her Sisters (1986).\n\n3. Vulnerability; or, Adversity in the Body\n\nSarah Bakewell\u2019s How to Live: a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer (London: Vintage, 2011) is very helpful on many aspects of\n  Montaigne\u2019s philosophy, including his attitude to death and illness. Michael Screech\u2019s Montaigne and Melancholy (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991) is fascinating on\n  Montaigne\u2019s ideas, his intellectual context and background, and is full of wise things.\n\nA really helpful book on Kafka\u2019s attitude to his body and to his illness is Sander Gilman\u2019s Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient (London: Routledge, 1995).\n\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s On Being Ill (Ashfield, MA: Paris Press, 2002) is the best short piece on illness I know.\n\n4. Dissolution; or, Adversity in Dying\n\nA very helpful reader, which contains a good introductory essay and then extracts from key philosophers on death, is Herbert Fingarette\u2019s Death: Philosophical\n  Soundings (Chicago: Open Court, 1997).\n\nDeath (Stocksfield: Acumen, 2006) by Geoffrey Scarre is one of the better one-volume, concise introductions to the topic of death as discussed in academic philosophy.\n\nTwo modern classics on death from the philosophical literature are Bernard Williams\u2019s \u2018The Makropulos Case: Reflections on the Tedium of Immortality\u2019 in his Problems of the\n  Self (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976) and Thomas Nagel\u2019s (partial) rejoinder \u2018Death\u2019 in his Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n  2012).\n\nHirokazu Kore-Eda\u2019s film After Life (1998) is an insightful exploration of death.",

Some, like the long, empty beaches of South Australia, invite us to serenity; others, like the suburbs of Amsterdam, reinforce the pleasures of bourgeois sobriety. Los Angeles speaks to our dormant worldly ambitions and foregrounds a less squeamish attitude to money; Miami or Rio de Janeiro can loosen inhibition and reserve and tug us towards a relaxed sensuality.\n\nThe destination we find ourselves drawn to reflects an underlying sense of what is currently missing or under-supported in our lives. We are seeking, through our travels, not just to see new places, but also to become fuller, more complete beings. The destination promises to correct imbalances in our psyches, for we are all inevitably a little lacking or excessive in one area or another. The place we go to should, ideally, help to teach us certain lessons that we know we need to hear. Our destinations are a guide to, and a goad for, who we are trying to become.\n\nTo make a wise choice about where to travel, therefore, we should look first not so much at the outer world but at the inner one. We need to ask ourselves what is missing or presently too weak within us, and on that basis, set about identifying a location somewhere on the planet \u2013 in the wilderness or a city, in the tropics or by a glacier \u2013 with the power to help us develop into the sort of people we need to become.\n\nTravel accedes to its true nobility when we ensure that the physical journey can support a well-defined inner journey towards maturity and emotional health.",

      "content": "## 2.What Is \u2018Exotic\u2019?\n\nOur societies have a strong sense of what makes a destination \u2018exotic\u2019. Normally, the word is associated with palm trees, temples to unfamiliar gods, humid heat and unknown animals.\n\nBut, stripped to its essence, \u2018exotic\u2019 has nothing to do with the prescriptive list of places with which it is typically associated. It merely means anywhere we yearn to go which we suspect has something important to teach us. Each of us is likely to have a private atlas of destinations that sound exotic to our ears, and which we need the courage and patience to unearth and bring into focus. The exotic is evidence of what is missing in ourselves.\n\nWe might be inspired to follow our own definitions of exoticism by the example of the nineteenth-century politician and writer Benjamin Disraeli. In one of his novels, Coningsby, the central character \u2013 a thinly disguised version of the author \u2013 develops a fascination for the factories and heavy industry of northern England. Though he and his friends have been used to holidaying in the countryside, the narrator admits that what would be truly exotic for him would be to go and spend two weeks investigating steel mills, cotton factories and coal mines. He does so, and the experience transforms him into a more serious and resolute person.\n\nThe modern equivalent would be someone cancelling a break in southern Spain to take a life-expanding trip to the appliance factories of the Ruhr valley or the data-storage centres of Montana.\n\nSadly, too often, we\u2019re shy about investigating what might really be exotic to us. We may end up in more clich\u00e9d \u2018exotic\u2019 places from a shyness about locating and declaring our true interests. We\u2019re often still at the dawn of properly knowing ourselves. At least we can be assured that no one will mock or say we\u2019re weird if we reveal we\u2019re off to Phuket or Barbados. But what is properly exotic to us might lie somewhere quite different, in the suburbs of Yokohama, a hilltop retreat in Bavaria or the Norwegian hamlet of Sveagruva.\n\nWe should dare to ask ourselves what feels properly exotic to us \u2013 even if it has no palm tree anywhere in the vicinity and occupies no space in any brochure \u2013 and ensure we have the resolve to pay proper homage to it in our next itinerary.",

Suddenly, for a little while, by the pool or in the mountains, we may have nothing to do other than to be happy. The prospect can be truly alarming.\n\nWe tend to have three big fears:\n\ni) If I settle back, throw away my cares for a time and enjoy what I have, I will lose the will to strive \u2013 which has been responsible for everything I have achieved to date.\n\nii) Enjoying beauty and comfort is selfish. There is, after all, simply so much suffering around.\n\niii) Enjoying life is not serious.\n\nIn Aesop\u2019s famous fable, \u2018The Grasshopper and the Ant\u2019, all summer long, the ant labours away and when winter comes, she has enough food to survive. All summer long, the grasshopper enjoys herself \u2013 and is starving the next winter. The moral of the story is likely to have burnt itself into our consciousness from a young age. Relaxation can be dangerous.\n\nBut none of our three fears stand up to closer examination:\n\ni) We can retain a sure hold on our striving-inducing dissatisfactions and, at the same time, occasionally savour the fragile harmony and beauty of a moment. In any case, unless we learn how to appreciate what we have, there is no point striving for more. Further gains are only worthwhile if our appreciative capacities are already functioning properly.\n\nii) Appreciation does not rule out compassion. Indeed, the more satisfied and rested we are, the more strength we have to bring to bear on the troubles of others. Being personally happy generates the best possible basis for helping to alleviate the griefs of strangers and friends.\n\niii) We don\u2019t have to enjoy life the way the adverts tell us: we can carve out our own vision of pleasure, every bit as serious and dignified as we wish it to be.\n\nWe should go easy on ourselves for needing a little encouragement to accept a very unfamiliar situation: a few moments of happiness.",

We\u2019ve inherited a romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find or deeply unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. We subtly like high prices. If something is cheap or free, it\u2019s a little harder to appreciate.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t wholly wrong, but unwittingly it exhibits a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary and the small-scale.\n\nYet the paradoxical aspect of pleasure is how promiscuous it can prove to be. It doesn\u2019t neatly collect in expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us in the big museum. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods.\n\nTravels are often filled with small pleasures. Perhaps it was the rye bread on the terrace of the hotel, the field of dandelions near the canal, a conversation with someone washing clothes at a fountain, the sound of the city heard on a walk through the park at night\u2026\n\nSuch things can lack prestige or social support.

      "content": "## 6.Water Towers\n\nOur societies are constantly sending out signals about what is potentially fascinating, impressive or beautiful to visit. They have been very good at getting us to see the charms of dolphins, mountains, little villages in rural France and art deco hotels from the 1920s. These are all very worthy objects of delight, but the list could be so much wider.\n\nIn 1972, a German couple \u2013 Bernd and Hilla Becher \u2013 started to photograph water towers across Germany and the United States. These industrial structures were amongst the least admired of all buildings; they were deemed hulking and brutish and people would get predictably furious if ever one was planned near where they lived.\n\nYet the Bechers\u2019 photographs \u2013 arranged in serene and elegant frames, and hung in sequences along gallery walls \u2013 showed just how beautiful these towers actually were. One could appreciate their patterns of rust and their rugged authenticity; their legs had a distinct dignity and playfulness. They were like curious monuments in the landscape.\n\nThe real point of the Bechers\u2019 exercise wasn\u2019t specifically about water-storage facilities. The towers provided an example for a much wider point: that there is a great deal more that is lovely and interesting in the world than we have yet been encouraged to suspect.\n\nThe example of these photographs teaches us something else. To gain access to the full range of what is valuable, we need to suspect that the current list of what is worth seeing is radically incomplete \u2013 and we should be ready to start expanding it by ourselves, one tower at a time.",

      "content": "## 7.The Importance of the Sun\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to be serious people with important things on our minds. But we can admit it without guilt: seeking sun is one of the central, and most important, motives behind going travelling.\n\nWe have, after all, been cold for so long. For months, we have been fending off wind, rain and despair. Through the impossibly long winter and freezing spring, we have been swaddling ourselves in layers. We hardly ever see our own legs \u2013 beyond a reluctant glance at their pallor in the bath. We have eaten for comfort. And it shows, a bit. But deep within us, we know we are essentially made for sunny mornings, hot lazy afternoons and warm nights that echo to the sound of cicadas.\n\nOn the beach, there are recliners under big straw sunshades. The water is warm. The heat envelops us and warms us to the core. Every day, the sky is perfectly blue and unclouded. From the hotel balcony, we can look out onto a succession of arid and scrubby hills; we love the sight of the baked and cracked earth because it speaks of weeks upon weeks of hot, dry weather.\n\nIt can suddenly seem inhuman that our species has so cleverly managed to sustain itself in places that are windswept, wet and dreary for almost the whole year. We have made good lives for ourselves up there \u2013 in Wiesbaden, Trondheim, Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 and Calgary. But at such a cost.\n\nSunshine isn\u2019t merely \u2018nice\u2019. It has a profound role in our lives. It is an agent of moral qualities: generosity, courage, the appreciation of the present moment and a confidence in our surroundings. We can feel our character changing in the sun: becoming something we like a lot more. When the world seems bountiful and easy (as it does in the heat), material accumulation looks less impressive or necessary. When we can have so much pleasure from sitting in a T-shirt and shorts and feasting on a feta and tomato salad, competing wildly for promotion loses its point. When it is so hot, there is no point even trying to read \u2013 or think too much.\n\nThe sun can correct our usual vices. The ways of the north are liable to be overly dominant and entrenched in our lives. We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and cautious.\n\nIt is a deeply noble search for wisdom and balance (which are the ideal goals of art, civilisation and travel) that has led us here \u2013 to an enchanting world of sun cream, dark glasses, recliners and vividly coloured cocktails by the pool.",

You went into the corner shop just off the main Motomachi shopping street to buy a prepaid mobile card. You pointed at your phone, said \u2018Hello, it\u2019s me\u2019, and mimed the actions of someone making a call. But it was useless. Mr Nishimura couldn\u2019t understand you at all. You were hot and flustered (it was 30\u00b0C and pretty humid) and felt very young again and an unusually big idiot.\n\nIt evoked the time at school when you were supposed to make a speech and your mind went blank, and the painful evenings at college when everybody else seemed to be heading off somewhere and you weren\u2019t sure if you could ask to join in.\n\nOver the years, in your life back home, you have learned how to avoid situations of awkwardness. You have become an expert at working around your diffidence and your fear of being the unwelcome focus of attention. But, of course, there\u2019s been a price to pay for your expertise at defensiveness. Whenever something feels alien or in any way threatening, your instinct has been to retreat, and you\u2019ve missed out on a lot.\n\nBut now, in Japan, fitting in is no longer an option. You are the stupid foreigner. Of course you can\u2019t know what you are supposed to do. Everyone stares at you wherever you go.\n\nIt sounds bad but, surprisingly, such extremity starts to offer you a certain sort of liberation. Maybe fitting in is overrated. Maybe not looking like a fool is simply not an option in any rich and interesting life, wherever it may unfold.\n\nSo you steel your nerves. You go back to the shop. You buy some wasabi-flavoured crisps and give the guy at the till a big smile. He grins back. You\u2019re learning. You opt to rent an apartment near the elegant Sankeien Gardens from a really nice guy called Kazutaka. A few days after, you drop in on the shop again and buy a packet of Chokobi mini star-shaped chocolate biscuits (they look fun). You make a joke about the rain. You say \u2018ame desu\u2019 \u2013 which you\u2019d practised after breakfast and hopefully means something like \u2018it\u2019s raining\u2019 \u2013 and gesture drolly at your wet hair. Mr Nishimura beams at you.\n\nThrough travel, you\u2019re freeing yourself from your inhibitions. You\u2019re growing up \u2013 and into yourself. Our journeys can teach us a vital skill: that of not minding so much if we occasionally look a fool. They may be the best conduits for developing into the more confident, less self-conscious people we crave to be.",

      "content": "## 9.The Pleasure of the Airport\n\nThe problem with the airport is that we tend to go there when we have a plane to catch. As a result, we are panicked, argumentative, stressed and entirely unable to notice that we\u2019re passing through one of the most rewarding and interesting zones of the modern world. We should make it a destination in its own right.\n\nThere are the beginnings of a thousand novels all around the departure lounge. Some of the trips commencing here will have been decided upon only in the previous few days, booked in response to a swiftly developing situation in the Munich or Milan office; others will be the fruit of three years of painful anticipation of a return to a village in northern Kashmir, with six dark-green suitcases filled with gifts for young relatives whom one has not yet met.\n\nNowhere is the airport\u2019s appeal more concentrated than in the television screens placed at intervals across terminals, which announce, in unromantic fonts, the itineraries of aircraft about to take to the skies. The screens imply a feeling of infinite and immediate possibility: they suggest the ease with which we might impulsively approach a ticket desk and, within a few hours, embark for a country where the call to prayer rings out over shuttered whitewashed houses, where we understand nothing of the language and where no one knows our identities. The lack of detail about the destinations serves only to stir unfocused images of nostalgia and longing: Rome, Tripoli, Nice, St Petersburg, Miami, Muscat via Abu Dhabi, Algiers, Kiev, Grand Cayman via Nassau \u2013 all of these destinations are like enemies of despair, to which we might appeal at moments of claustrophobia and stagnation, when home has become too much.\n\nWe forget how extraordinary and peculiar air travel can be. Yesterday we had chicken inasal for lunch at a crowded open air stall in the humid heat by the Guimaras Strait, and later this morning we\u2019ll be sat at gate 42 at Heathrow eating a bacon and egg roll while we wait for our connecting flight to Glasgow, where it\u2019s currently -2\u00b0C.\n\nArrivals can be hellish, of course, but despite the exhaustion, your senses are on fire, registering everything \u2013 the light, the signage, the skin tones, the metallic sounds, the advertisements \u2013 as if you were on drugs or a newborn baby \u2013 or Tolstoy. It is like being reborn. How peculiar this morning light seems against the memory of dawn in the Obudu hills. How unusual the recorded announcements after the wind in the High Atlas.\n\nWe should never give up this perspective. We should want to keep in mind everything we\u2019ve learnt of alternative realities, as we have seen them in Tunis or Hyderabad, Lima or St Gallen. We should never forget that nothing here is normal, that the streets are different in Valletta and Luoyang, that this is only one of many possible worlds.\n\nDespite its (often well-deserved) appalling reputation, the airport is \u2013 in its own way \u2013 trying to teach us a range of very important things.",

To the side, a pair of engines, their immense labours concealed within their gently rounded casing. In modest lettering they announce their limited, but precise demands: that we avoid walking on the wing from which they are suspended and that we do not attempt to pour anything other than oil into their small apertures. Later they will be tended by a team of engineers, currently sleeping, in a service hanger on another continent.\n\nIn the cabin, there is not much talk about the clouds that are visible up here. No one thinks it remarkable that somewhere above an ocean we flew past a vast white candy-floss island which would have made a perfect seat for an angel or even God himself in a painting by Piero della Francesca. No one leaps to their feet to announce with requisite emphasis that, out of the window, we are flying over a cloud, a matter that would have amazed Leonardo and Poussin, Claude and Constable.\n\nThe world feels large and we very small \u2013 and the contrast is delightful. On this scale, the actions and concerns of our own lives don\u2019t really count for much. We\u2019re beautifully reminded of our own thorough unimportance.\n\nAcross history, people have imagined their gods living on lofty mountaintops or in the sky, looking down benignly on human life. It\u2019s not a random association: from this height we can smile gently at humanity and perhaps love it a little, too. Even the grimmer areas of urban sprawl look serene and beautifully organised: the eastern suburbs of Glasgow nestle among wide tracts of farmland; microscopic lorries work their way placidly towards the docks of Hamburg along elegant ribbons of autobahn.\n\nThe view helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home. Their faults drop away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We want to be patient and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We\u2019d like to tell them in franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them.\n\nLunch arrives; we spear a tiny roasted potato or a small piece of fish and prise the foil top off a squat carton of orange juice as we pass over a region where, four miles below on the ground, we would need to travel in an armed convoy. Later we pad along the aisle to explore the lavatory, wearing the shapeless socks the airline has provided. Perhaps at this moment a team of climbers are encamped below the summit of a ferocious mountain, bracing themselves for a final assault on the ice walls and overhangs \u2013 while we carefully dry our hands and think of watching a comedy on our seat-back screen.\n\nThe physical world \u2013 against which our ancestors struggled \u2013 has been tamed; our little tube of alloy and glass slips calmly over the forests, deserts and oceans that thwarted and terrified them.\n\nAs we start the descent, helped by the complex manoeuvres of the plane through the lower atmosphere, we dream of becoming the people we long to be. We\u2019ll be energetic but thoughtful; sensitive but adventurous; we\u2019ll eat modestly, appreciate our circumstances and remain committed to doing our best with the time that remains to us.",

      "content": "## 11.Pretty Cities\n\nThe majority of our days are spent on ugly streets. Ever since the development of concrete, steel and plastic, monstrosities have become the norm. Most of our cities are furiously ugly.\n\nOne (optimistic) view is that this might not matter very much. Perhaps we can be the same sort of people wherever we happen to be; the colour of the bricks or the design of windows surely leave the fundamentals of life unchanged.\n\nAnd yet, as our travels show, we crave architectural and civic beauty, because we intuitively appreciate how much we are at the mercy of our architectural environments. We know we aren\u2019t the same people wherever we go. In the middle of Frankfurt, Milton Keynes or Detroit, the ugliness hacks away at our souls. And in Trieste or Portland, Seville or Florence, our benign personalities expand\n\nIt would be a good deal easier if we could remain in much the same mood wherever we happened to be. It is maddening how vulnerable we are to the coded messages that emanate from buildings. In the best cities, the streets whisper of hope, dignity, community and friendship. They invite us to become the noblest versions of ourselves.\n\nIf we better understood the impact that ugly architecture has on our lives, its power to sap our spirits and give assistance to our worst selves, we\u2019d surely legislate against it. But as yet, no politician who announced an intention to make the built environment more beautiful would prosper \u2013 or even be deemed sane.\n\nIn utopia, architecture would more fairly be interpreted as a branch of mental health, with a crucial role to play in public contentment. And bad design would \u2013 at last \u2013 be interpreted as the crime it is to the health of the collective spirit.\n\nUntil then, it is to travel \u2013 and the intelligent, soul-stirring streets of San Gimignano or Kyoto, Jaipur or Yangon \u2013 that we must direct our longings.",

There\u2019s a man, who must be a decade older than you, sitting on a worn leather stool in a little booth selling pistachios, preserved lemons and harissa paste. This might have been his life for the last twenty years or so. His radio is playing music by someone you don\u2019t recognise, but who is probably a huge star, with a powerful voice that soars as she repeats a word that sounds like \u2018eleh\u2019. You\u2019ve travelled a long way to go and see the Hassan II Mosque. For him, it\u2019s just a typical backdrop to ordinary life \u2013 as familiar and unremarkable as your queen\u2019s palace might be to you.\n\nOr you\u2019re in the German capital, in a small bar in Kreuzberg, around the corner from the hotel you\u2019ve just checked into; it\u2019s quite busy, even though it\u2019s the middle of the afternoon. There are candles lit on all the wonky tables; next to you, a good-looking couple are having an intense conversation in which the words Kultur and Philosophie keep getting stressed; a middle-aged woman is immersed in a thick book (about Schopenhauer) and taking rapid notes; at quiet moments the bartender is skimming through a newspaper \u2013 Die Zeit \u2013 which, you notice, features a large mathematical equation on the front page.\n\nWhat we can feel at such moments is a basic pleasure at encountering \u2018otherness\u2019: practices, customs, habits and vocabularies that are strikingly at odds with those we know from home and which give us a welcome reminder of the sheer diversity and complexity of the world. From a settled vantage point, it\u2019s only too easy to picture humanity as homogeneous and, therefore, a little dull and prescriptive. But this isn\u2019t a view which can survive the first few hours in a new country. We\u2019re quickly reminded that, for all the talk of globalisation, places retain a fascinating, welcome distinctiveness. The smells, the sounds, the bread, the light at dawn, people\u2019s shoes, the way of making tea, the arrangements of the taps and sockets, the light at 5pm\u2026 everything is satisfyingly \u2018other\u2019. This can become an invitation to explore alternative ways of living and thinking. There may be many more routes to being happy than the ones we\u2019ve explored to date. Perhaps we can make the changes that had felt so impossible before.\n\nAll this the pistachio-seller is subtly helping us to remember. We might buy a packet or two from him to cement the lesson.",

By some unseen, undiscussed but all-powerful rule, tourism tends to separate us from the inhabitants of the countries we\u2019ve come to visit. They remain shadowy, occasional figures: the guy by the pool, the taxi driver from the airport, the nice lady who took us on the trip through the forest. But the real focus is always elsewhere, on the culture and the monuments, the natural spectacles and the food.\n\nThis is a source of serious sadness. Most of the places we want to travel to are associated with a distinctive way of being: an implicit personality. In New York, it might be confidence and modernity; in Amsterdam, the dignity of daily life; in Melbourne, a welcome directness and warmth. It\u2019s a range of human virtues that draw us to places, but we\u2019re normally only permitted to encounter these via their external, cultural expressions. We don\u2019t really want to shop or see pictures; we want to talk.\n\nYet we remain \u2013 painfully \u2013 outsiders. We pass a big family celebration at a long table on a caf\u00e9 terrace. Someone is singing a song to which everyone knows the words. We scan the properties for sale in the windows of estate agents and picture ourselves moving in. We observe people after work catching trains and buses home to areas we know nothing of. We\u2019re continually noticing interesting faces, styles of clothing, the gestures friends use when they greet one another. In the evening, we hear the sounds of a party filtering down from a brightly lit third-floor flat. We may have explored every painting this country made in the eighteenth century and become experts at the late medieval style of its temples, but we\u2019re only scratching the surface of its being. The genius loci \u2013 the spirit of the place \u2013 is eluding us. We want to know what it would be like \u2013 if only for a few days \u2013 to join in and belong; and to try out for ourselves the nicest aspects of the attitudes and point of view of the people who live here.\n\nIn the travel industry of the future, we\u2019ll regard booking a local friend as no different from booking a hotel room or a flight: just another essential, normal part of organising a successful trip.\n\nUntil then, we must develop our skills at courageously going up to strangers and sharing a thought on the weather or the state of local politics. Or else we can remain in our shy cocoon, but should at least interpret our melancholy feelings as symptoms of an industry-wide failure, not a personal curse.",

We select a truly stunning location right on the ocean or in a fashionable district that used to be full of factories and is now dotted with stylish boutiques. The hotel has very nice bedside lamps, fine art on the walls and a luxurious marble bathroom. The service is impeccable. We secure a succession of tables at well-reviewed restaurants. We arrange a sleek car to meet us at the airport. There are endless attractions for the children. We pay for a tennis teacher. We feel deeply fortunate: we are going to have the holiday of a lifetime.\n\nBut amidst all this expenditure, we\u2019re liable to have neglected a crucial component of human contentment. All capacity for satisfaction depends first and foremost upon emotional well-being. The slightest psychological disturbance can destroy the benefits of a multi-billion-dollar hotel and chauffeured automobile. If our partner makes a snide comment, it won\u2019t matter how celebrated the homard au champagne happens to be; the delicate richness of its flavour will count for very little when we\u2019ve been the victim of a sarcastic remark about our career potential. A grumpy thirteen-year-old child can single-handedly negate the efforts of an entire team of gardeners or museum curators. Or if the person we are with won\u2019t have sex with us in the way we really want, it will be no consolation that some small tubes of conditioner in the vicinity have been personally selected by Donatella Versace or that a handmade Belgian chocolate truffle was placed on the pillow into which we now feel like weeping deeply.\n\nRegarded from an immense, impersonal distance, these are comic eventualities; close up they feel more like tragedies. This isn\u2019t an argument against luxury \u2013 just an analysis of its limitations. The same sorrows might easily come our way on a shoestring budget. We\u2019re not encountering the irrelevance of spending a great deal of money on travel: only the centrality and primacy of emotional satisfaction within the total economy of happiness.",

The point has little to do with the destination or the thrills of the itinerary: it lies in the capacity of a trip to cement the bonds of affection between family members; in the power of a trip to make a family.\n\nFor a start, trips erase the normal hierarchy between generations. A child gets to see their parents in unfamiliar \u2013 and often usefully less than impressive \u2013 situations. A father looks awkward in swimming trunks, a bulging stomach no longer disguised by a carefully fitted suit; or a mother \u2013 who is normally effortlessly in charge \u2013 is revealed as rather shy when it comes to trying to order from a foreign menu. With their frailties and limitations more on show, parents are humanised. A father turns out to be very nervous about being splashed in the pool, a mother is useless at building sandcastles. A child has a chance to be a parental equal or superior. When it comes to manoeuvring a rowing boat into the jetty or buying tomatoes at the market, a ten-year-old might be as adept as \u2013 or more skilled than \u2013 a parent; there\u2019s a new, welcome experience of equality.\n\nThere are associated benefits in experiencing danger together: in being caught out in a rainstorm after the museum, in getting lost in the bazaar, in needing to sort out a stolen wallet, in having to find somewhere to sleep at 11pm. At the time, these discomforts feel like an interruption of the real point of the trip. Only later do we realise that they are what helped us to get to know one another properly and overcome the egocentricity and reserve of home.\n\nA trip is helpful, too, in allowing parents to see the world through the unjaded eyes of their children. The normal hierarchies of pleasure are upturned and new delights unearthed. The breakfast buffet at the hotel becomes thrilling in a way it otherwise never would, because for a five-year-old child, few things are as delightful as being allowed to carry a small plate around and choose freely from three kinds of bread and explore strange combinations of cheese and strawberries or a sausage and smoked salmon. The museum of art has nothing to rival this. In the company of children, we notice how conservative our adult sensibilities have become. We realise we have forgotten how enchanting a small lizard can be or how much fun is available from timing jumps over a succession of small waves.\n\nWhen adolescence arrives, the family holiday often loses its sweetness; the child wants to remain at home or go out with their friends; it would be horrible to go for a walk along the beach with parents or join them on the tennis court. The death of the family holiday in adolescence is \u2013 ironically \u2013 quite probably the very earliest move towards a new epoch of family holidays, due to start in two decades\u2019 time or so. The rejection of the parents, which seems so harsh right now, is what will allow children, in turn, to have a family of their own one day \u2013 and eventually to end up doing all the things they currently most disdain. They\u2019ll be singing in the paddling pool and pretending their ice cream is too hot; they\u2019ll make unfunny jokes with the best will in the world and won\u2019t care very much that there\u2019s a coffee stain on their ill-fitting T-shirt. They too will come to learn the invaluable benefits of a family trip away.",

      "content": "## 16.The Pleasure of the Romantic Minibreak\n\nOne of the stranger aspects of relationships is that we may, in order to sustain them, need to go away together every now and then.\n\nIn theory, it should make no difference to love quite where we happen to be. But in practice, the furniture may have to alter, so that we can. The familiar backdrop of home keeps us too tightly and punitively tethered to whom we have so often been \u2013 which may mean, to the less impressive and more unkind versions of ourselves. The sofa remembers that argument we once had on it; the kitchen keeps us connected to some unpleasant scenes that unfolded in it over too many evenings.\n\nBut the new surroundings have no such memories. They allow us to start afresh and rediscover wellsprings of affection and generosity. The minibreak isn\u2019t a chance to avoid conflict. It\u2019s an opportunity to have some of the discussions we really need to have, with enough time and kindness to deal with what we uncover. The problem with our rows at home isn\u2019t that they happen, but that we don\u2019t find the energy to get to the root of them.\n\nWe\u2019re carrying around a range of complaints. Perhaps they sounded too petty or humiliating to mention at the time. But when they fester, the currents of affection start to get blocked \u2013 and soon, we may find ourselves flinching when our partner tries to touch us. What we call \u2018loss of desire\u2019 is usually simply a kind of anger with a partner that hasn\u2019t had a chance to understand itself.\n\nThe holiday is a safe moment in which to reveal some of these \u2013 typically entirely unintentional \u2013 hurts. It is a chance, too, for gratitude. The partner has brought us so much we\u2019ve forgotten to thank them for. They have made it possible to do things we\u2019d never have accomplished on our own; they\u2019ve comforted us at certain moments, they\u2019ve maybe understood and been kind to difficult aspects of who we are; possibly they have saved us from the worst effects of some specific tendencies in our nature.\n\nWith the help of a trip away, we can jog our memories and help each other to come to a fairer, more precise view of our lives together.",

      "content": "## 17.The Little Restaurant\n\nAlmost all of us are, when we travel, in search of this ideal establishment: the little restaurant. Let\u2019s picture it for ourselves. It\u2019s fairly small, ten or a dozen tables. It\u2019s unpretentious; the floor and the walls are quite bare and the chairs simple in the extreme. The place has no anxiety about itself. It knows it does its job well and has no need to be ingratiating with its customers. The grilled fish is good enough for the lightbulbs on the wall to be left exposed without shame. The menu is extremely short, and perhaps chalked up on a blackboard by the till every day. Everything is simple, fresh, yet absolutely remarkable. It comes quickly, the waiters are friendly and unfussy, the water comes in an old wine bottle \u2013 and the bill, when it arrives, is very modest indeed. As we pay, we think to ourselves that this truly is the perfect restaurant.\n\nThe problem is that such places are woefully rare. Every traveller is in search of such an establishment and yet they are as elusive as gold dust. Why are we, collectively, not better at making little restaurants?\n\nThe romantic answer is that these businesses are the result of genius, and cannot be made to spring up in large numbers. But that cannot be true. The reality is that the lovely little restaurant isn\u2019t a chance aberration; it\u2019s founded on a set of reasonable, logical and teachable ideas about what makes people happy. If we understood ourselves and human nature a little better, there could conceivably be countless such \u2018locals\u2019.\n\nThrough the prism of the little restaurant, we meet with a big truth about travel: we\u2019re not very good at understanding what really makes us content. Our answers tend towards the expensive, the grandiose, the sentimental and the kitsch. We aren\u2019t good at working back from what we really enjoyed and then designing businesses that can cater to it.\n\nIf we were cannier about our pleasures, we\u2019d ensure that we spent more time chatting with people and less time in museums; that we\u2019d be less seduced by whale-watching trips and more alert to the interest of walking around foreign supermarkets.\n\nAnd we\u2019d grasp that we were less interested in the grand and ornate brasserie, and more attuned to the distinctive charms of the little restaurant. Going travelling collides us repeatedly with a big, difficult, but also in a sense rather exciting idea: that we\u2019re collectively still at the dawn of knowing how to make ourselves properly happy.",

      "content": "## 18.\u00a0In Defence of Crowds\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable, of course, to hate crowds. Good travellers are always complaining about them. Perhaps we ascended Mount Pilatus in Switzerland early in the morning and were disgusted to find that there were already several dozen people at the summit, or we went to Athens to look at the Parthenon and we were appalled by how many groups were wandering about the ruins.\n\nOur distress is very real. But if we examine our annoyance in detail, it turns out that it\u2019s not actually the presence of lots of other people that is bothering us so much. Crucially, there are certain occasions when we have a powerfully positive experience of being in a crowd. If we\u2019re attending \u2013 for instance \u2013 the Olympic Opening Ceremony, it\u2019s deeply thrilling to feel that we\u2019re sharing moments of collective pride with many others in an atmosphere of dignity and prowess. Or, if we\u2019re at a religious service in a cathedral, the grandeur and solemnity of the occasion is profoundly enhanced by the fact that thousands of people are at the same time rising to their feet and singing a hymn, or simultaneously contemplating the errors of their lives and seeking forgiveness for the wrongs they have all done to one another.\n\nKeeping such experiences in mind shows us that it\u2019s rarely the pure quantity of other human beings that upsets us: it\u2019s something else. It is the lack of a sense of nobility, ceremony or shared occasion. It could be one of life\u2019s most majestic experiences to be gathered on a mountain top with a multitude of others in a moment of joint awe and humility at the sight of the world spread below us; it could be deeply moving to be part of a mass of people who gathered around the broken columns of an ancient Greek temple dedicated to the goddess of wisdom.\n\nKnowing this can\u2019t, by itself, solve our problem with crowds. But it shows us more accurately what\u2019s bothering us when we travel: we don\u2019t hate people, we\u2019re just missing the sense of dignified shared devotion. We don\u2019t really need every place to ourselves. We want there to be a crowd \u2013 only of a different kind.\n\nOn a densely populated planet, the ideal of being alone is very understandable \u2013 but it has grown ever more problematic. All the very interesting and attractive places get busy. The desire to journey away from the crowd simply leads us to a desperate scramble for ever more remote locations: the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the ice shelves of Alaska and (most exclusive of all) outer space; places which will, in turn, get spoilt too.\n\nHowever, the grander and more hopeful ambition is to transform our experience of being one of many; to turn the idea of a group from an insult to a virtue: to make belonging as nice as it can be.",

You pick up the phone, balancing the in-room dining menu on your knee, you nip into the shower and flick on the news and half an hour later someone comes to your room with a tray, or wheels a trolley to the foot of the bed. The meal itself might not be anything terribly special \u2013 chicken schnitzel or macaroni and cheese \u2013 but it\u2019s surrounded by signs of care. They\u2019ve kept it warm in a special heated recess under the table or covered it under a small metallic dome; someone has wondered if we might like flowers, and has inserted a tulip into a narrow glass vase to cheer us as we eat; they\u2019ve worried that we might be fussy about bread and provided a small selection; they\u2019d like to know if we prefer still or sparking water.\n\nThey don\u2019t always get it right. But their thoughtfulness is touchingly evident. It\u2019s such a poignant contrast to how things often go at home: your child doesn\u2019t even look up when you say good morning; your partner grunts when you mention that you had a tricky day at work; at parties you catch them speaking in a rather dismissive, offhand way about what an idiot you generally are.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising if \u2013 as we sit on the bed half-naked in our dressing gown and bite into an apple strudel \u2013 we are genuinely moved. It\u2019s all artifice of course \u2013 engineered by payment. But thanks to an item on the credit card bill, we can get something truly lovely: a portion of the kindness we crave, but hardly ever receive.\n\nMoney won\u2019t buy what we most want: the warm regard of those we live with. But we can get at least a symbol of considerateness, and sometimes that might be the best we can hope for in our broken, radically imperfect lives.",

Natural phenomena \u2013 it might be the ocean, a sheep, a forest or a valley \u2013 have nothing whatsoever to do with our own perilous and tortured human priorities. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and self-absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest sense of our role on the planet.\n\nA sheep doesn\u2019t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never emailed. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we\u2019re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were chewing gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool, and for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused glance.\n\nBeyond the sheep are a couple of oak trees. They are of especially noble bearing; they gather their lower branches tightly under themselves while their upper branches grow in small orderly steps, producing a rich green foliage in an almost perfect circle. It doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s an election or what happens to the stock market or in the final exams. The same patterns of growth would have been going on when Napoleon was leading his armies across Europe or when the first nomads made their way towards the Appalachian hills.\n\nOur encounter with nature calms us because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes has any relevance to it. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the ocean, the sheep, the trees, the clouds or the stars; they are deeply important representatives of an entirely different perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.",

      "content": "## 21.Drawing Rather than Taking Photographs\n\nWhenever something looks interesting or beautiful, there\u2019s a natural impulse to want to capture and preserve it \u2013 which means, in this day and age, that we\u2019re likely to reach for our phones to take a picture. Though this would seem to be an ideal solution, there are two big problems associated with taking pictures. Firstly, we\u2019re likely to be so busy taking the pictures, we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. And secondly, because we feel the pictures are safely stored on our phones, we never get around to looking at them, so sure are we that we\u2019ll get around to it one day.\n\nThese problems would seem to be very much of today, a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But they were noticed right at the beginning of the history of photography, when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the English art critic, John Ruskin. He was a keen traveller who realised that most tourists make a dismal job of noticing or remembering the beautiful things they see. He argued that humans have an innate tendency to respond to beauty and a desire to possess it, but that there are better and worse expressions of this desire. At worst, we get into buying souvenirs or taking photographs. But, in Ruskin\u2019s eyes, there\u2019s one thing we should do and that is attempt to draw the interesting things we see, irrespective of whether we happen to have any talent for doing so.\n\nBefore the invention of photography, people used to draw far more than they do today. It was an active necessity. But in the mid-nineteenth century, photography killed drawing. It became something only \u2018artists\u2019 would ever do, so Ruskin \u2013 passionate promoter of drawing and enemy of the camera \u2013 spent four years on a campaign to get people sketching again. He wrote books, gave speeches and funded art schools, but he saw no paradox in stressing that his campaign had nothing to do with getting people to draw well: \u2018A man is born an artist as a hippopotamus is born a hippopotamus; and you can no more make yourself one than you can make yourself a giraffe.\u2019\n\nSo, if drawing had value even when it was practised by people with no talent, it was \u2013 for Ruskin \u2013 because drawing can teach us to see: to notice properly rather than gaze absentmindedly. In the process of recreating with our own hand what lies before our eyes, we naturally move from a position of observing beauty in a loose way to one where we acquire a deep understanding of its parts.\n\nRuskin was very distressed by how seldom people notice details. He deplored the blindness and haste of modern tourists, especially those who prided themselves on covering Europe in a week by train (a service first offered by Thomas Cook in 1862):\n\nNo changing of place at a hundred miles an hour will make us one whit stronger, happier, or wiser. There was always more in the world than men could see, walked they ever so slowly; they will see it no better for going fast. The really precious things are thought and sight, not pace. It does a bullet no good to go fast; and a man, if he be truly a man, no harm to go slow; for his glory is not at all in going, but in being.\n\nSo he slowed things down and recommended we spend far longer looking at impressive things, even quite simple things. His own drawings showed the way.\n\nIt is a measure of how accustomed we are to rushing that we would be thought unusual and perhaps dangerous if we stopped and stared at a place for as long as a sketcher would require to draw it. Ten minutes of acute concentration at least are needed to draw a tree; the prettiest tree rarely stops passers-by for longer than a minute.\n\nWe should dare to give drawing a go.\n\nFind some paper and give drawing a go",

      "content": "## 22.Holiday Fling\n\nOf course the idea of a short-lived holiday romance can sound rather crass or emotionally exploitative. But there\u2019s potentially a good version that links falling in love (even though we know it probably won\u2019t last) to the best ambitions of travel. The ideal lessons that a destination might offer to teach us are not fully contained in its history or its public monuments and museums. They are encoded in the lives of the people who live there: in the way they see the world, in their attitudes to work, to each other, to family.\n\nRomance becomes valid and important as an aspect of tourism because of the way it rapidly deepens a relationship to another person and thereby a place. As we kiss, we overcome the distancing layers of conventional politeness that so often get in the way of encountering another individual. We move to a higher level of communication.\n\nIt\u2019s not the physical intimacy itself that really matters. It\u2019s all the other things that happen around it: late into the night, they tell us the inside story of their childhood and how their parents met; we go with them to their local supermarket to get something for lunch; we hear about the troubles of their friends; we get to know their ambitions and their worries. Perhaps the most poignant moment is when they unlock their front door: we pass out of the street that anyone can walk along and enter their private world. We get to see the places that are usually closed off from the tourist. We hear about their schooldays and what it was like looking for work. They tell us about their boss and their colleagues.\n\nAll these details educate us. What can grandly be called the \u2018spirit of the place\u2019 \u2013 the thing that we\u2019ve travelled to meet \u2013 stops being an abstract, intellectual notion. It becomes more tangible and more specific; it\u2019s earthed. We\u2019re not just looking for random company: we want to meet an individual who properly represents the virtues of their locality. It might seem foolish to connect with someone so intensely for such a brief moment when we know they live hundreds of miles and several time zones away from us and yet, when things go right, we may really be doing, in the most direct and profound way, the very thing that we came here to do: learning and growing through contact with important virtues and attitudes that are missing in ourselves.",

In the eighteenth century, well-off young English men would take trips to Paris and Rome to acquire more elegant manners and study Classical history; today we might travel to find sunshine or nature.\n\nBut there are many things we struggle with beyond our inability to understand Roman culture or endure a long, wet winter \u2013 and travel can help us with them. A central issue is that we are constantly at risk of feeling disenchanted with our circumstances. At a personal level, we are continually exposed to the enviable lives of others; our imaginations are haunted by our comparative lack of success. At a more general level, our societies often appear fundamentally unimpressive: our institutions look compromised, our media seems coarse and sensationalist, our cities feel chaotic. There is, apparently, little to be grateful for.\n\nIn theory \u2013 of course \u2013 we know that can\u2019t be entirely true. We know, in the abstract, that we\u2019re lucky to have enough to eat and a roof over our heads. But such reminders feel emotionally unreal and usually have little impact on their own.\n\nFor the truth to hit home, we may have to immerse ourselves in true poverty and a genuinely dysfunctional society. We may need to travel to the large parts of the world where people live, on average, on $500 a year or less.\n\nWe may need to visit a place where it\u2019s normal for the police to extort money from you; where a newspaper editor is likely to be arrested for criticising authority; where government is self-evidently tied to violence and corruption; where the opposition is an armed faction; where a fair trial is a rarity; where luxury would be clean sheets or a tube of toothpaste; where there might be excrement in your food or a dead rat under your bed. A city or country where people maddened by toothache pull out their own teeth; where horrendous infections are commonplace; where large numbers of children receive almost no formal education; where, if there is a school, it is quite probable that those in charge are syphoning off the funds; where sewers run openly through the streets; where people spend their days picking over the refuse in huge dumps.\n\nWe may well end up deeply moved. As importantly, we are invited to change our perceptions of our own lives, to renew our appreciation of so much that we\u2019d taken for granted: a toilet that flushes, a washing machine, space to ourselves, a pleasant lunch. And we may derive a new sense of how profound and powerful the achievements of our own societies \u2013 for all their failings \u2013 really are.\n\nParadoxical though it sounds, travels to places where the true hardships of existence are grimly evident can provide a needed education in gratitude. Our encounter with the reality of the lives of so many others pushes us towards a more accurate perspective on our own condition. Like many great artworks in elegant galleries, they teach us to see \u2013 and admire \u2013 aspects of the world we usually inhabit that we had scarcely noticed before. And they do this with rather more conviction and lasting impact than any canvas on a wall.",

      "content": "## 24.Travel and Pilgrimages\n\nReligions have shown a surprising degree of sympathy for our impulse to travel. They have accepted that we cannot achieve everything by staying at home. They\u2019ve also taken travel very seriously, far more seriously than we do now; they\u2019ve interpreted it as a major way to be healed.\n\nIn Christianity, the point of a pilgrimage was to visit a shrine of a long-dead saint and there beg for a cure for a variety of physical and mental ailments. Every ailment called for contact with a specific holy place, of which there were a confusing multitude scattered across Europe. France alone offered mothers having trouble lactating a choice of forty-six sanctuaries of Mary\u2019s Holy Breast Milk (\u2018Had the Virgin been a cow,\u2019 observed the sixteenth-century Protestant John Calvin unkindly, \u2018she scarcely could not have produced such a quantity.\u2019). Atlases of pilgrimages were like complex apothecaries: believers with a painful molar were advised to travel to Rome to the Basilica of San Lorenzo, where they would touch the arm bones of St Apollonia, the patron saint of teeth or, if such a trip were awkward, they might go and find pieces of her jaw in the Jesuit church at Antwerp, some of her hair at St Augustine\u2019s in Brussels, or her toes at disparate sites around Cologne. Unhappily married women were directed to travel to Umbria to touch the shrine of St Rita of Cascia, patron saint of marital problems (and lost causes). Soldiers looking to embolden themselves before a battle could commune with the bones of St Foy in a gold-plated reliquary in the abbey church in Conques in southwestern France \u2013 while people who worried excessively about lightning could gain relief by travelling to the Jesuit church in Bad Muenstereifel in Germany and laying hands on the relics of St Donatus, believed to offer help against fires and explosions of all kinds.\n\nThough we no longer believe in the divine power of journeys to cure toothache or gall stones, and though most of the problems motivating pilgrimages are now more appropriately addressed by a visit to a clinic, we can still hang on to the idea that certain parts of the world possess a power to address our ills. There are places that, by virtue of their remoteness, vastness, climate, chaotic energy, haunting melancholy or sheer difference from our homelands exert a capacity to salve the wounded parts of us. These sites, valuable rather than holy, help us to recover perspective, reorder our ambitions, quell our paranoias and remind us of the interest and obliging unexpectedness of life.\n\nThough we intuit this at a general level, we lack, as yet, a tradition of approaching travel from a properly therapeutic perspective and so of analysing landscapes according to their benefits to our souls. We lack atlases of destinations with which to treat our worries and sorrows.\n\nThe Christian Church kept a tight grip both on where pilgrims went, and on what they did and thought about each day as they made their way there. It sought to buttress otherwise fleeting and forgettable sensations by giving pilgrims prayers and songs, it urged them regularly and publicly to rehearse their motives for travelling and it equipped them with distinctive garments to help them mentally separate themselves from their ordinary lives.\n\nMedieval travel was slow at the best of times, but committed pilgrims went out of their way to make it even slower, forgoing the use of river barges or horses in favour of their own feet. A pilgrimage from northern Europe to the remains of St James the Apostle in Santiago could take eight months, pilgrims leaving in the spring and not making it back before the onset of winter.\n\nPilgrims were not being perverse in their insistence on slowness and difficulty. They were aware that one of our central motives for travelling is a desire to put the regrettable aspects of the past behind us, a desire explicitly recognised in the Christian notion of the pilgrimage as a penance. Furthermore, they knew that one of the most effective ways of achieving a feeling of distance from follies, vanity and sinfulness is to introduce something very large \u2013 like the experience of a month-long journey across a desert or a mountain range \u2013 between our past and our desired future. Our attempts at inner transition can be cemented by a protracted and hazardous progress. If inner change is difficult, then we may need a commensurately difficult outer journey to inspire and goad us.\n\nWhatever the advantages of plentiful, swift and relatively convenient air travel, we may curse it for being, in the end, not painful or slow enough \u2013 and so for subverting our attempts to draw a convincing line under the past.\n\nThe travel industry should not be allowed to escape the underlying seriousness of the area of life it has been assigned to oversee. We need to relearn how to use travel as a way of being existentially healed, rather than merely entertained or tanned.",

      "content": "## 25.How to spend a few days in Paris\n\nParis is one of the world\u2019s most famous and visited cities. How should we spend a couple of days there? In trying to answer this, we\u2019ll simultaneously be examining some big questions about travel more generally.\n\nOften a trip to Paris is organised around a homage to culture. We want to get in touch with great cultural figures: we go to see their works and the places they lived and worked. We\u2019re trying to get close to them. But there\u2019s a strange irony: one of the things these people would never have done is visit museums. We would be better off focusing on what they loved, not what they made or where they hung out.\n\nFor instance, we might want to honour the eighteenth-century painter Chardin by going to the Louvre and looking at some of his paintings.\n\nThe Silver Cup, Chardin, 1899.\n\nBut Chardin didn\u2019t spend his time doing that: he had little interest in exhibitions. What he liked doing was going to the market and buying apples and looking at them carefully.\n\nWe might be inclined to make a trip to the caf\u00e9 de Flore at the intersection of boulevard Saint-Germain and rue Saint-Beno\u00eet in order to see the place where Jean-Paul Sartre did a lot of his philosophical writing.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre and writer Simone de Beauvoir having lunch at a caf\u00e9 in Paris, 1964.\n\nAt the back of our minds, perhaps, we hope that by seeing the place we\u2019ll boost our own creative and intellectual life. That\u2019s a very nice and important goal. But there\u2019s something curious about the way we\u2019re pursuing it. Sartre went to that caf\u00e9 because it happened to be a pleasant stroll from where he lived and (at the time) it was cheap and convenient. He didn\u2019t himself visit caf\u00e9s to see where other writers had had lunch. To be closer to him in spirit we should do what he did: go to any modestly priced caf\u00e9 we quite like that\u2019s near to where we\u2019re staying and work on our own ideas.\n\nIt could seem rather interesting \u2013 if one is literary-minded \u2013 to pay a visit to a recreation at the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet of Marcel Proust\u2019s bedroom: the cork walled room where he wrote much of his great novel, In Search of Lost Time.\n\nMarcel Proust\u2019s bedroom, as recreated at the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, Paris.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t something that would ever have particularly appealed to Proust himself. What he wanted to do was to stay in his own bedroom and think in great detail about his childhood, and he would have encouraged us to do the same. The true place to commune with Proust is back in our own little rented apartment.\n\nMost visitors to Paris drop in to Notre-Dame.\n\nThe people who built it wanted us to come. But they weren\u2019t hoping that we\u2019d be impressed by its pioneering use of flying buttresses or by the gargoyle water spouts high up on the roof. They primarily wanted us to examine our consciences and feel sorry for the wrong we have done to others; they wanted us to be generous to the needy and to wonder about the point of human existence.\n\nNotre-Dame Cathedral, Paris.\n\nThese are experiences we can come by \u2013 perhaps more readily \u2013 in other places. Maybe by visiting one of the less famous graveyards, such as the Passy Cemetery, where the brevity of life is grimly apparent and where the hurts and preoccupations of our lives are put in true perspective.\n\nPassy Cemetery in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nMaybe we\u2019d go to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay to see Claude Monet\u2019s painting La Gare Saint-Lazare, which he painted in 1877.\n\nLa Gare Saint-Lazare, Claude Monet, 1877.\n\nThe irony is that Monet himself didn\u2019t go to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay to paint this work. He spent many hours at the most sophisticated transport hub he could find, contemplating the technical grandeur of modern life. If we want to love what Monet loved, we might make space in our visit to spend more time at Charles de Gaulle airport.\n\nCharles de Gaulle airport.\n\nNone of the great Parisian cultural figures \u2013 around whom many trips to Paris revolve \u2013 went there on holiday. They were writing, thinking and painting in the place they happened to live. They were interested in things \u2013 the beauty of ordinary objects, the meaning of life, memories \u2013 that don\u2019t belong to any one particular place. Perhaps the ideal outcome of two days in Paris is the realisation that we may not need to visit Paris at all.\n\nGoing home is, usually, the very sad bit. Does it have to be?",

      "content": "## 26.How to Come Home\n\nGoing home is, usually, the very sad bit. Does it have to be?\n\nSeated together on most planes are people with very different expectations of where they are going: for some this will be the start of a journey to a new land, whilst others are those returning home. The first group is filled with excitement; they have guidebooks, cameras and knots of anticipation. The second may be too sad to touch their in-flight trays. On the final descent, they gaze at the landscape with melancholy faces. They have only home to contemplate, with its banal associations. And yet the two groups are travelling to the very same place. Once they have crossed customs, they will have before them the same monuments, museums, landscapes and foods.\n\nWhy do we accord such privileges to foreign places, and such ready disdain to our own lands? Would it not be one of the greatest skills, the most helpful kind of practical wisdom, to know how to sample a little of the excitement about our own countries that travellers are able to locate there?\n\nReceptivity or openness might be the chief characteristic of the traveller\u2019s mindset. As travellers, we approach new places with curiosity. We don\u2019t assume we know everything. We stand on traffic islands and in narrow streets, gawping at and admiring what the locals take to be strange, small details. We risk getting run over because we are intrigued by the roof of a government building or an inscription on a wall. We find a supermarket or hairdresser unusually fascinating. We dwell at length on the layout of a menu or the clothes of the presenters on the evening news. We are alive to the layers of a country\u2019s history beneath the present.\n\nAt home, on the other hand, we assume we\u2019ve discovered most of what is interesting about the neighbourhood, simply by virtue of having lived there a long time. It seems so hard to imagine that there could be something novel to unearth in a place where we\u2019ve spent our daily lives over many decades.\n\nBut consider how much you might notice if you walked out of the front door, and imagined you had never seen any of it before, if you pictured yourself as a foreigner from a far-off land newly disembarked from a long-haul flight.\n\nGiven the limits on how much we are able to travel (and its costs and side-effects), we should endeavour to try, before taking off for distant hemispheres, to notice what we have already so often seen close at hand but have learnt to neglect, because it is familiar. And when we despair at coming back, we should be goaded on by the thought that \u2018boring home\u2019 is always someone else\u2019s deeply exciting \u2018abroad\u2019.",

      "content": "## 27.The Advantages of Staying at Home\n\nLying in bed late at night or waiting on the platform for the train home, we often daydream about where it would be nicer to be: perhaps the beaches of Goa, a little restaurant by a quiet canal in Venice, the highway near Big Sur or the Faroe Islands, far to the north of Scotland.\n\nThe desire to travel is, almost always, sparked by a picture or two: a couple of mental snapshots that encapsulate all that seems most alluring about a destination. A trip lasting many hours and costing what could be a small fortune may be initiated by nothing grander or more examined than one or two mental postcards.\n\nWe travel because of a background belief that, of course, the reality of a scene must be nicer than the evanescent mental images that take us there. But there is something about the way our minds work that we would do well to study before we ever pack a suitcase: mental images are momentary. That is, they last, at best, three seconds. When we imagine a scene, we imagine not a film, but that far briefer and in many ways far more forgiving medium, a picture.\n\nAnd yet, we are never in a destination just for a moment, and that brute fact alone may be enough to cause grievous damage to the hopes that transport us far from home. We know the phenomenon well enough at the cinema. Imagine if in the course of a story, the screen were filled with a sublime view of ocean waves crashing against a craggy headland. We might sigh with desire at such splendour. But if the camera started to linger on the scene, we might rapidly grow twitchy. What is fabulous in increments of seconds can become properly maddening after half a minute. Two minutes in, we may be so irritated as to be ready to leave our seats.\n\nIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re ungrateful or shallow, rather that we absorb beauty quickly and then want to move on. Beauty is like a brilliant joke: we laugh, but don\u2019t need the comic element to be continuously replayed.\n\nThe lovely mental pictures that get us to travel are \u2013 in essence \u2013 hugely edited versions of what we actually encounter in any destination. We will, eventually, certainly see these pictures, but we will also see so much else, so much that is painful or boring, dispiriting or mundane: hours of footage of the stained airline seat ahead of us, the back of the taxi driver\u2019s head, the wall of the cheap hotel, a framed photograph of Marilyn Monroe on the wall of a little local restaurant...\n\nFurthermore, there will always be something else on the lens between us and the destination we\u2019d come for, something so tricky and oppressive as to undermine the whole purpose of having left home in the first place, namely: ourselves.\n\nWe will, by an unavoidable error, bring ourselves along to every destination we\u2019d ever wanted to enjoy.\n\nAnd that will mean bringing along so much of the mental baggage that makes being us so intolerably problematic day-to-day: all the anxiety, regret, confusion, guilt, irritability and despair. None of this smear of the self is there when we picture a trip from home. In the imagination, we can enjoy unsullied views. But there, at the foot of the golden temple or high up on the pine-covered mountain, we stand to find that there is so much of \u2018us\u2019 intruding on our vistas.\n\nWe ruin our trips through the fateful habit of taking ourselves along on them.\n\nThere\u2019s a tragi-comic irony at work: the vast labour of getting ourselves physically to a place won\u2019t necessarily get us any closer to the essence of what we\u2019d been seeking. As airlines, hotel chains and travel magazines conspire never to tell us, in daydreaming of the ideal location, we may have already enjoyed the very best that any place has to offer us.",

We book airline tickets, visit beaches, admire glaciers, watch elephants drinking\u2026\n\nIn all this, the emphasis is almost always on the experience itself \u2013 which lasts a certain amount of time, and then is over. The idea of making a big deal of revisiting an experience in memory sounds a little strange \u2013 or simply sad.\n\nWe\u2019re not assiduous or devoted cultivators of our past experiences. We shove the nice things that have happened to us to the back of the cupboard of our minds and don\u2019t particularly expect to see them ever again. They happen, and then we\u2019re done with them.\n\nThey do sometimes come back to us unbidden. We\u2019re on a boring train ride to work, and suddenly an image of a beach at dusk comes to life. Or while we\u2019re having a bath, we remember climbing a flower-covered mountain with a friend a decade before. But little attention tends to get paid to such moments. We don\u2019t engineer regular encounters with them. We may feel we have to dismiss them as \u2018daydreaming\u2019 or \u2018thinking about nothing\u2019.\n\nBut what if we were to alter the hierarchy of prestige a little and argue that regular immersion in our memories is a critical part of what can sustain and console us \u2013 and, not least, is perhaps the cheapest and most flexible form of entertainment. We should learn regularly to travel around our minds and think it almost as prestigious to sit at home and reflect on a trip we once took to an island with our imaginations as to trek to the island with our cumbersome bodies.\n\nIn our neglect of our memories, we are spoilt children, who squeeze only a portion of the pleasure from experiences and then toss them aside to seek new thrills. Part of why we feel the need for so many new experiences may simply be that we are so bad at absorbing the ones we have had.\n\nTo help us focus more on our memories, we need nothing technical. We certainly don\u2019t need a camera. There is a camera in our minds already: it is always on, it takes in everything we\u2019ve ever seen. Huge chunks of experience are still there in our heads, intact and vivid, just waiting for us to ask ourselves leading questions like: \u2018Where did we go after we landed?\u2019 or \u2018What was the first breakfast like?\u2019\n\nWhen we can\u2019t sleep, when there\u2019s no Wi-Fi, we should always think of going on Memory Journeys. Our experiences have not disappeared, just because they are no longer unfolding right in front of our eyes. We can remain in touch with so much of what made them pleasurable simply through the art of evocation.\n\nWe talk endlessly of virtual-reality. Yet we don\u2019t need gadgets. We have the finest virtual reality machines already in our own heads. We can \u2013 right now \u2013 shut our eyes and travel into, and linger amongst, the very best and most consoling and life-enhancing bits of our past.",

We sometimes cannot work it all out by staying rooted in one place. We have stared at the screen too long, we have been bumping into the same inner obstacles without progress, we have grown claustrophobic within ourselves.\n\nThat is why we need the sight of the three oak trees and two robins by the river or the maelstrom of the high street, where we linger outside a grocer\u2019s shop and wonder (inconclusively, yet again) what dragon fruit might taste like. The better part of our minds has a habit of getting exhausted and sterile. It is scared as well. Some of the most profound thoughts we need to grapple with have a potentially disturbing character. An inner censor tends to kick in and block the progress we were starting to make towards ideas that \u2013 though important and interesting \u2013 also presented marked threats to short-term peace.\n\nWhile we walk, the mind is no longer on guard. We\u2019re not supposed to be doing much inside our heads; we\u2019re mainly occupied with following a path around a pond or checking out a row of shops. The ideas that have been half-forming at the back of our minds, ideas about what the true purpose of our lives might be and what we should do next, keep up their steady inward pressure \u2013 but now there is a lot less to stop them reaching full consciousness. We\u2019re not meant to be thinking and so \u2013 at last \u2013 we can think freely and courageously.\n\nThe rhythmic motion of an easy stride helps to separate us from the ruts of our current preoccupations and allows us to wander more freely though neglected regions of our inner landscape. Themes we\u2019d lost touch with \u2013 childhood, an odd dream we had recently, a friend we haven\u2019t seen for years, a big task we had always told ourselves we\u2019d undertake \u2013 float into attention. In physical terms, we\u2019re hardly going any distance at all, but we\u2019re crossing acres of mental territory.\n\nA short while later, we\u2019re back at the office or at home once again. No one has missed us, or perhaps even noticed that we\u2019ve been out. Yet we are subtly different: a slightly more complete, more visionary, courageous and imaginative version of the person we knew how to be \u2013 before we wisely went out journeying.",

      "content": "# I. Introduction\n\nThere are many people who will cajole you to take an interest in nature because they see this as a necessary part of a broader environmental goal. I am not one of them and\n  this book is not part of that benevolent drumbeat. Of course everybody wants to live in a sustainable environment, in the same way that nobody of right mind wants war. Some people are more\n  passionate about it than others, but no sane person likes to see the planet irrevocably harmed.\n\nIn this book I am imploring you to connect with nature for a different reason. This reason is that it is the best possible deal out there. A strong connection with nature will give you a much\n  more interesting experience, every minute you spend outdoors. That is one side of the deal. The other side is that this connection will make you a more interesting and effective person. I know that\n  is a bold, if not arrogant statement, but I do mean it. Have you ever found yourself talking to somebody who is so engrossed in the practical details of life that you find it hard to connect with\n  them? Perhaps the person who talks about their plans for developing their property without relenting? Or the one who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing?\n\nHave you ever lost interest in somebody because they are so enthralled by their own philosophical view of an issue that they cannot see the real world around them? I\u2019m thinking of the\n  person who corners you to discuss problems in the developing world, oblivious to the fact there is a young child playing with a sharp knife next to them.\n\nThe joy of discovering a deep connection with nature is that it allows each of us to see each living thing, object and idea within its own intricate network. It allows us to view things in the\n  most practical and philosophical way simultaneously. There is no other field that I am aware of that does this. We can look at a plant as a source of food, and as a key to appreciating a moment in\n  time \u2013 at the same time.\n\nThe desire to connect with nature is not commonplace. Most people remain oblivious to the sounds of the birds all around them. They can ignore the most exquisite form of a\n  wildflower and fail to find any beauty in the insect by their feet. \u2018Surely,\u2019 we might hear them say, \u2018only those geologists who have opted out of society can find a rock\n  interesting.\u2019 This is the ordinary view. It is a view held by a lot of people who would be happy to have more interesting lives.\n\nSince you are reading this book, you take the extraordinary view. You either suspect or already know that feeling a connection with nature has the potential to be an exciting and meaningful\n  experience. Perhaps you have a desire to rediscover a lost connection: if we go back far enough we all find there was once a bond. It is found for many in memories of childhood, but we can be\n  certain of finding it by going back further still, to our ancestors.\n\nLater in the book I will argue that the stimulation a full connection with nature can bring to each person is life-enhancing to the point where it changes who we are. However, there are a few\n  steps to take before that small leap and in Part II of the book I will introduce each of these. In Part III we will explore each step more fully and in Part IV we will look at the importance of\n  understanding the concept of time in nature. The fifth and final part of the book covers the wild philosophical places these steps can lead to.",

      "content": "# 1. Getting Ready\n\n\u2018The obvious is usually profoundly significant.\u2019\n\n(EDWARD O. WILSON)\n\nWhat does it mean to feel a connection with nature?\n\nIt means gaining an insight into the most important network there ever has been and ever will be. It means becoming aware of our relationship with this network. It means expecting a fascinating\n  and enriching experience each time we step outside. And it means embarking on a journey that leads towards the realization that every single thing that we have found interesting up to this point in\n  our lives has its roots in this network we call nature. Health, business, politics, sport, sex, violence and culture: all subsets of nature.\n\nA connection with nature allows us to see the roots that sustain and explain everything around us. The interest we find in a place is intimately tied to the history of that place and how far\n  back we look. Many people focus on what has taken place during the past week, or two hundred years, but we can look back millions of years if we choose to. Politicians may like to warm themselves\n  by focusing on the belief that they are arguing in the Houses of Parliament because they are very important representatives of the People. They only see the last pages of the book; if they flicked\n  back to earlier chapters they would see that they are just Homo sapiens, a species that needs a lot of water to thrive and migrates towards rivers to form colonies in places like\n  Westminster. Big Ben might be thought of as the plumage of that one peculiar species.\n\nIn 1943, the American psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed a theory based around a human hierarchy of needs. He suggested that healthy development follows a sequence that\n  progresses from the most basic needs, like food and shelter, towards more complex emotional ones, like respect and self-esteem. It is an idea that is mirrored in the steps necessary to form a deep\n  connection with nature.\n\nOur ancestors must have subconsciously appreciated that a discussion about self-esteem was a low priority if they were starving and suffering from frostbite. Busy, \u2018sophisticated\u2019\n  modern humans allow themselves to believe that these earlier, lower stages in the hierarchy are in the past, of little relevance to our lives today. But this is a mistake; if we are looking to make\n  a profound connection with our environment we cannot start at the top. Some of the first areas to explore are the practical ways that we can reconnect with nature.\n\nFor the majority of us it is possible to experience a deep sense of joy in doing something new. This desire for novelty may no longer be vital in terms of survival,\n  but it is essential if we want to think differently. This is because there are some basic actions that can bypass our modern and artificial obstacles to thinking. It does not take a huge change in\n  lifestyle to achieve this joy; small actions introduced to a modern routine can have the desired effect. The simple act of using the sun or moon to prevent yourself from becoming disorientated as\n  you drive to a new friend\u2019s home, for instance, is a more important experience than many might have guessed.\n\nSheltering from the wind in a hollow, eating wild berries or curing an ailment with a leaf are no longer necessary physically; we can buy products to overcome these challenges instead. But to\n  achieve a connection with nature they are wonderful early steps. Ludicrously simple acts with obvious consequences can offer surprising philosophical rewards. Walking towards the sound of water\n  gurgling in a stream when thirsty, instead of thinking about a tap or bottle, can open up new thought patterns. A basic new action can blow away some of the sophistries that get in the way of\n  profound insight. This is an idea that has been central for Buddhists for centuries, not least the Zen and Shugendo movements, but which remains important to all of us, regardless of our personal\n  religion or philosophy. That is the whole point of doing it.\n\nNew actions inevitably lead to new experiences, and this novelty kicks our senses out of the slump induced by routine. This in turn raises our levels of awareness. One of the\n  peculiar consequences of starting to notice new things is that we cannot help but notice how little we have been noticing hitherto.\n\nOnce we notice something that until now has slipped past us, our minds are likely to develop a voracious appetite for more. We will not be satisfied with a morsel, but find ourselves urging our\n  senses on to devour all the things out there that we have overlooked. And unlike so many urges to binge, this desire is healthy. Heightened awareness is one of the few mind-altering\n  \u2018substances\u2019 which lends itself to excess without redress.\n\nThe way to satisfy this craving is to get to know our senses and then work with them, tuning them, giving them a good workout and then unleashing them on new areas. Ask someone, ideally someone\n  you trust, to lead you on a blindfolded walk. Then remove the blindfold and attempt to draw the landscape you walked through. The act of using your senses in a new way and drawing, whether or not\n  you consider yourself an artist, will lead to a new sensory awareness. If that all sounds like too much effort to start with, then just try walking into an open outdoor space and lying on the\n  ground for ten minutes. The required effort-levels don\u2019t get much lower.\n\nOur senses soon reward their new fitness. We start to notice new beauty. Things that once hid behind the great veil of busyness stand out. It is as though a mist has cleared. We see shapes and\n  colours that can\u2019t possibly have been around us all along. Can they?\n\nOur senses repay us in so many surprising ways. We become aware of the way things change and react. It is so much easier to connect with someone or something that reacts to you. You\u2019re\n  thicker-skinned than most if you do not react at all when somebody comments on your clothing, and amazingly scientists have proved that even plants react to the clothes we wear.\n\nPlants react to colours. For example, if we are dressed in blue we can change the way a plant grows, while if we wear red we will influence its timekeeping. The process by which plants grow\n  towards light is called phototropism and is only influenced by blue light. Red light, on the other hand, influences photoperiodism, which governs the plant\u2019s sensitivity to the time of year.\n  The changes in a plant that result from our choice of clothing colour may be imperceptible to us, but the knowledge that they are reacting can change the way we think about them.\n\nThe Glorious War\n\nAs our senses fuel a growing awareness of our surroundings, something strange happens. A new dynamism becomes apparent. This nice wallpaper that we have been calling\n  \u2018nature\u2019 and ignoring for ages is no longer quite so easy to ignore. Why? Because we find ourselves drawn into the conflict raging all around us.\n\nConflict is one of the few guaranteed ways of luring us into a subject. We are programmed to find conflict interesting. Movies, soap operas and boxing matches all rely on conflict to keep bums\n  on seats. Nature is a box-office winner for those who notice and understand the conflict inherent in it.\n\nThose who are determined to find nature uninteresting are unaware of nature\u2019s hand of cards. Nobody goes into a game of poker with someone who can summon aces at will. Nature\u2019s trump\n  card is that we are programmed, by nature, to find conflict fascinating, and nature is conflict. No card sharp can beat that hand. Almost every living thing is permanently engaged in a battle of\n  survival. It is the longest-running, highest-budget, most compelling drama that has ever been staged. There are recurrent themes, as there are in all good dramas, but no commercial breaks, no\n  repeats and no cheap seats.\n\nSomething and Violence\n\nWhy do sex and violence get paired and then blamed for impairing the minds of young people via computer and TV screens? Partly because kids gravitate towards these two\n  phenomena: they make for irresistible stories. It is not just rubber-necking drivers on roads who find carnage magnetic. Have you ever noticed how kids can\u2019t resist pausing by death? I walked\n  in the woods with one of my sons the other day and found him lagging behind. When I retraced my steps to see if he was okay, I found him hypnotized by a dead stoat beside the path. A small\n  motionless corpse held his attention in a way that would make Nintendo shareholders salivate.\n\nViolence we know as the final dance of conflict, but sex is equally important to our psyches. Our species is not alone in finding sex of overwhelming interest at times. The instruction manual\n  that Darwin found threaded through nature reads something like this:\n\nStep\u00a01:\n\nFind conflict and sex of interest, or die, lonely and then extinct.\n\nStep\u00a02:\n\nMake sure you understand Step 1.\n\nThat is not a pretty flower you are looking at. It\u2019s a sex machine, whoring itself to the bees. How can something so pretty be so wanton! The intrigue grows when we\n  realize that some vibrant colours attract while others repel.\n\nPoisons have failed in their task if they are ingested; it is too late to deter something that has already eaten you. And so organisms warn predators that trouble is in store with bright colours\n  and extreme contrast. Predators soon learn that these combinations make for a poor meal or worse. We learn to make similar associations too. The greater the contrast and the brighter the colours in\n  our road signs, the more likely there is danger ahead. Dull brown and a little white: something harmless, like a tourist attraction. Lots of bright yellow and some black: potential hazard, like a\n  low bridge.\n\nSome of the most admirable creatures use colour and contrast for both sexual allure and violent repellence. The peacock butterfly is instantly recognizable to mates, but is also able to deter\n  predators. One flex of its wings, and \u2018eyes\u2019 appear on its back, and the rodent predator sees an arch-enemy owl and scuttles away in a panic.\n\nThe Venus flytrap is one of the most famous plants in the world, loved by many, not least kids, and abhorred by a few too. But nobody finds it dull on first meeting. \u2018A plant that springs\n  a trap shut and murders its victims in an acid bath, you say? Tell me more.\u2019 Well, okay, if you insist. The flytrap part of the name comes, logically, from its habit of trapping\n  flies. The Venus part comes from the lewd imagination of eighteenth-century naturalists like John and William Bartram, who thought they saw a likeness of the female genitalia in the form\n  of Dionaea muscipula.\n\nIs that bright colour trying to lure something into bed, or warning of a poison that will kill? Butterflies and fungi. Sex and violence.\n\nA Unique Experience\n\nNew awareness leads us to notice time in a fresh way. Time is shy and likes to remain concealed for half a lifetime or more. It is no coincidence that those whose time has been\n  called, those who battle a terminal illness, are the people who report the most intense awareness of their surroundings and the passing of time. But we need not wait for such a predicament to stop,\n  look and listen. An interest in nature is a philosophical pension. The sooner you start investing, the greater and longer the rewards. Did I mention that it doesn\u2019t cost anything?\n\nA path you thought you knew now sounds different underfoot, and is slippery with fallen leaves. The light is different too and a new strong smell of decay engulfs you. Sights, sounds and smells\n  mutate with the months. There are the most extraordinary fresh-air calendars to be found on each walk. The Ongee, the indigenous people of the Andaman Islands, use a scent calendar. As each flower\n  blossoms and gives its scent to the forest air, that is the smell that comes to define the time of year.\n\nThe clock that cannot be bought, the one that mocks those ineffectual coils and springs, is tick-tocking all around. If we return at a later date to a spot we have visited, it will be a very\n  different place. The more we notice, the more obvious it becomes that it is impossible to return to the same spot twice. And strange new sensations crowd in around.\n\nIf we stay out past sunset, we will notice that certain star constellations hide for much of the year: Orion is a winter constellation, Scorpius a summer one. The night sky holds other regular\n  visitors who appear as promised and then disappear for a whole year. If we are sensitive to these changes in the sky, then they come to be closely associated with the seasonal changes on the ground\n  and our own habits. The gardening writer Katherine Swift, for example, likes to welcome the Perseid meteor shower after jam-making in August.\n\nMore excitingly, and alarmingly, it is impossible even to return to the same place within a single day. The daily changes that shape each place are dramatic, but take greater levels of awareness\n  to unlock and so go unnoticed by almost everyone. As the flowers react to the angle of light and the sun makes its way across the sky, whole fields change colour. When my neighbour has sown\n  linseed, the field I know best turns from a moody mauve in the morning to an ebullient purple at lunchtime. Each and every day, birdsong is marking out a soundscape that shifts west as the earth\n  turns and we find ourselves standing on a music box that needs no winding.\n\nThe world around us is morphing; it is a shape-shifter. Colours, smells and sounds swirl through daily and annual patterns, putting on displays then disappearing with promises to return in new\n  clothes. There is the regularity of a solar drum behind all the changes, but this regularity passes through the individual kaleidoscope that is our locality. Time makes both sense and a delightful\n  madness of each place and moment. The only certainty is that you will only get one opportunity to experience each scene exactly the way it is. It will be different if you return in ten months or\n  ten minutes.\n\nTime is not content to limit its power to conducting the changes in the landscape all around us, and one of its delicious tricks is to slip in through our ears and sculpt our thoughts and\n  senses. We all have individual chronotypes, which is just a scientific way of saying that we are subject to our own daily ups and downs. Some have energy in the mornings, the larks, some in the\n  evenings, the owls, and many of us like to throw coffee, chocolate and stronger things at these tides in an effort to manipulate them. Our experience of the world is deeply subjective.\n\nEach day our sleep patterns, blood-sugar levels and hormones dramatically repaint the scenes we see. Psychologists are building a better and more bizarre understanding of the world as we see it.\n  In a lecture I gave at the Royal Geographical Society, I showed the audience a photograph of a pile of bananas and asked them to quickly shout out the colour they first saw. \u2018Yellow!\u2019\n  they cried at first. Then, \u2018No, White.\u2019 The photo was black and white. The world is not always as it seems and time, like shapes, can trick us.\n\nThe Banana Skin and the Great Network\n\nAs we set out to build a stronger connection, we need to beware an early trap. It is very hard to find nature interesting if you are bundling all of it into one lot. This is\n  the biggest risk early on.\n\nNature is not one big pile. Plants set some people on fire and douse the enthusiasms of others. Some dedicate much of their life to the study of an individual insect species while others recoil\n  at any creepy-crawly they see. The pioneering American planter of apple trees, John Chapman, felt it wrong to ride a horse or chop down a tree. He was so cross when he accidentally stepped on a\n  worm that he punished his own foot by throwing away its shoe. Nature is diverse. People are diverse. Each to their own. And footwear is optional.\n\nIt is not just feathers and leaves and those millions of living organisms that stimulate intrigue and obsession. The eminent metallurgist Cyril Smith was colour-blind. He formed his own\n  fascination and bond with nature by learning to appreciate the intricate patterns in metal alloys. Smith became sensitive to the \u2018swirls, filigree, and banding\u2019 that each metal offered\n  his senses. The biologist Edward O. Wilson has gone so far as to claim that the love of machines is but a specialist form of nature-loving. Jeremy Clarkson is therefore a naturalist. He has been\n  called many things, but a naturalist? Well, let\u2019s try petrol-head instead. Petrol is refined oil, which is derived from decomposed zooplankton and algae. Clarkson may not be a naturalist in\n  the common understanding of the word, but he is a zooplankton-head.\n\nIn time we come to appreciate that the tiny part of nature\u2019s spectrum that lures us in at first \u2013 perhaps the birds, the orchids, the colour of sand; who knows, except you? \u2013\n  is intimately connected to one or two other parts. We come to know those other parts by association. A best friend\u2019s friend becomes a friend, enemy or lover with time.\n\nWhatever first draws you in, there will come a moment when it becomes clear that its close connections in turn have their own connections. This is the exhilarating moment when we realize that\n  everything is connected. It is something that we need to experience ourselves; merely being told about nature\u2019s interconnectedness, here or anywhere else, can prompt you to look for it, but\n  it cannot recreate the effect of experiencing it. For all who take the time to find it, there comes a giddy second when the pieces suddenly fly together in a dizzying vortex of geology, biology,\n  ecology and many other words ending in \u2018ology\u2019. But, thankfully, this experience takes place without the words themselves attached. Our attempts to label things don\u2019t make the\n  beauty or our experience of it. They can help or hinder us in our attempts to find it, but they form the map, not the territory, and are far from the extraordinary experiences to be found within\n  it.\n\nOur senses might reveal an animal, which can tell us something about the plants with which it shares its habitat, which in turn reveal something about the rocks, soil and climate. All around,\n  the scents, colours and sounds are marking the moment precisely, while our experience is shaped by what we had for breakfast and what we got up to the night before. A furry creature becomes a key\n  to unlocking everything around you and inside you.\n\nWe emerged from a habitat and we will return to a habitat, as mulch of some kind. Our experience in the short time between these two moments will be in some part determined by the interest we\n  take in our habitat. It is hard to lead a poorer life by noticing more.\n\nWe are where we are because we have been drawn here by a conspiracy. It is a grand and wonderful conspiracy, one that snares every plant, animal and human being. It is so much more fun being\n  snared voluntarily by a system we understand and enjoy than by one that baffles us.\n\nIn the following chapters we will step from looking at the broad connections that are easy for all to spot, towards some of the more extraordinary ones. The aim is to reach the point where the\n  networks that these connections form touch the world that fascinates you. I have no idea exactly where that will be, but I am certain that if you have a heart pumping blood to your nervous system,\n  it can be found.",

      "content": "# 2. The Senses\n\n\u2018What is called our experience is almost entirely determined by our habits of attention.\u2019\n\n(WILLIAM JAMES)\n\nIn December 2004 the Jarawa tribe headed away from the coast, where they liked to hunt turtles, and up into the hill country of the Andaman Islands. Then the biggest wave\n  imaginable hit the shore.\n\nThe Jarawa had managed to sense and escape the Asian tsunami that destroyed the ground and life where they had been standing. They were tuned to the clues of imminent upheaval in the land, sea\n  and animals around them, and this instinctive sensory awareness saved their lives. The cry of birds and the way marine animals\u2019 behaviour changed shortly before the tsunami gave the\n  indigenous people just enough warning to escape to higher ground.\n\nThe Jarawa saved their lives, but this chapter is about the way the senses that help preserve our lives can also enhance our lives. There is a gulf between being alive and dead, but this gulf is\n  not the same size for everybody. John Burroughs, an American writer and naturalist in the late nineteenth century, was ahead of the game when he wrote, \u2018There is nothing people differ in more\n  than in their powers of observation. Some are only half alive.\u2019\n\nNobody wakes up in the morning and decides to shut down their senses and stumble through each day in an oblivious bubble, and yet some people end up having much richer experiences than others.\n  If two people go for an identical walk, one of them might have a profounder, more fascinating experience than the other, but why? One reason will be each person\u2019s life experiences to\n  date.\n\nA study by the US military found that soldiers of equal military experience did not see the world in the same way. Most critically, some soldiers were markedly better at spotting potential\n  dangers, like improvised explosive devices and other ambushes. The two groups that stood out in this research were those with a hunting background and those who came from tough urban\n  neighbourhoods. These groups had clearly been conditioned by their former experiences to see the world as a mixture of threats and opportunities: a lack of awareness translated into a bad day of\n  different sorts to each group, and, as a consequence, their senses were finely tuned to any anomalies in their landscape.\n\nWe are unlikely to want to enlist the help of insurgents or urban thugs to sharpen our senses, and any attempt to hone our senses through the introduction of fear will only appeal to a minority.\n  It is true that those who jump off tall buildings with parachutes develop a forensic level of understanding of the elements, but those who make mistakes also experience a marked deterioration in\n  their sensual ability when they hit the concrete below at 150 miles per hour. There are better ways to enrich our experience of life.\n\nThere is enough evidence of people experiencing the world in transformative ways to make us believe it is both possible and achievable. The improvements we can enjoy from time spent in nature\n  are physical and physiological \u2013 we become fitter, happier and learn to use our senses more effectively \u2013 but they are also philosophical. One of the early pioneers of our modern\n  reconnection with nature, Henry David Thoreau, wrote that \u2018two or three hours\u2019 walking will carry me to as strange a country as I expect ever to see.\u2019\n\nIf we notice ten times as much when we step outside, then one mile will feel like a ten-mile walk used to (to our minds, that is, but mercifully not our legs).\n\nIf we wish to notice more, it is a good idea to slow down; and noticing more will itself tend to make you slow down. This is true whatever you focus on. My fascination with natural navigation\n  means I am pulled back by wildflowers, clouds, trees, rocks, planets and even puddles. Paths that I could have bounded along as an ignorant teenager have become treacle, as my senses arrest my\n  progress. I now find it much harder to go for the really long walks I used to, not because I have lost the ability physically, but because I notice so much now that I am repeatedly confronted with\n  the same awkward and unwelcome decision: take too long or ignore things? It takes a certain immaturity to walk over twenty miles in one day and not feel your head overload with sensual input. I\n  know.\n\nHow many senses are there? Five? Six? Some say between ten and thirty. Proprioception is the sense we have of where our joints are, even though we can\u2019t see them: we can\n  tell where our hands are when our eyes are closed. We have all sensed thirst, hunger, tiredness, low blood-sugar . . . It is easy to see how the list grows, but the philosophy for each is identical\n  and so we can focus on the ones we know best, and the lessons from these can be applied elsewhere if we choose.\n\nSight\n\nThe sense of sight is the best one to start working with as it is the most familiar and powerful for most people. But this power comes at a cost: our sight is so effective at\n  getting the basics done that we lazily overlook its full potential.\n\nOur eyes pass so much detailed information to our brain that our brain has been forced to develop coping and filtering strategies. Inevitably we fail to notice most of what we see, because we\n  can only concentrate on a portion of the canvas presented to us. This has been demonstrated with a smile in the \u2018gorilla basketball experiment\u2019, where an audience is shown a clip of two\n  people passing a basketball to each other and asked to count the number of passes. In the background a man dressed as a gorilla enters the court and wanders about. Asked if they saw anything\n  unusual on the court, the audience fails to come up with anything. The audience all laugh at their partial blindness when they are told to watch the clip again and look for the gorilla, not count\n  the passes. In another very amusing example of our imperfect visual attention, a film is shown of an actor stopping to ask a stranger for directions. As they chat, a large wooden door is carried\n  between them. In the brief moment that they cannot see each other, the actor ducks away and swaps with someone else. As the door is carried away and the view is no longer blocked, the stranger\n  continues the conversation, entirely oblivious to the fact they have metamorphosed into a different human being. Both great fun, but what value for those with an interest in nature?\n\nExercise 9",

      "content": "## PART II\n\nRepeat your three-minute walk, following the same route, only this time try to ignore anything that moves, as much as is safely possible. Let your eyes be drawn to things\n      that remain still. Ignore everything that shows any motion at all, people, animals, leaves in a breeze. It should feel a little peculiar and lead to you noticing at least a few things that you\n      overlooked on your first walk.\n\nOur brains have learned to notice things that move, so if we make a special effort to look for things that are still we see a subtly different world. I would ask you to repeat\n  your walk, this time looking for things with shapes and colours you find the most boring \u2013 but asking you to do so might test your enthusiasm for this exercise, so it can be a theoretical\n  walk for now. We have survived as examples of our species because we successfully prioritize the things that are likely to be a threat or an opportunity. It is harder to get killed by things that\n  are still, or boring colours, as this eliminates most predators and a lot of poisons.\n\nWe all see the world through a prism, our own personal lens, one that is shaped by both our experience and our goals. My work means that I spend a lot of time outdoors with experts and\n  specialists \u2013 geographers, geologists, botanists, farmers, soldiers, artists, foragers, foresters \u2013 and one of the things I have found most interesting is that we are all incapable of\n  experiencing the same patch of earth in the same way. We are all conditioned to look for certain things in certain places.\n\nThere is one particular experiment I like to conduct on my natural navigation courses that demonstrates the challenges and opportunities available by understanding our own personal lens. Early\n  in one of my outdoors courses, I lead people up a short, steep, muddy bank of a field and then show them a tree, next to a fence, in the middle distance. I give them the following instructions:\n  \u2018I\u2019d like you to stare at this tree for a whole minute. I want you to burn an image of its silhouette into your retina. Try to learn and memorize its shape and outline. Once you have\n  done this we are going to walk for one minute and during this time it is very important that you don\u2019t look back at the tree.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d like you to look at the photograph on this page, it is the view that my students get and I\u2019d like you to stare at the tree too.\n\nStudy this tree shape for 1 minute before reading on.\n\nMy students and I then walk for a minute, during which I make sure they do not peek at the tree. When we have reached the right spot, I ask them to turn round and look at the tree they think\n  they know so well. Now look at the second photograph below.\n\nSouthwest is to the left of the picture; this is the direction the wind has come from.\n\nThe single tree has become two trees and completely changed shape. Most students are pleasantly shocked to have seen me wield my powers of magic in this way: \u2018What pact\n  has he made with the dark forces?\u2019 is a line I hear them say to each other quite regularly. (That\u2019s not true, but the rest is.)\n\nI go on to explain that we can notice that certain trees are windswept and this can tell us where southwest is, since this is the direction that the prevailing winds blow from in the UK. My\n  second point \u2013 which is more important than the simple technique of direction-finding \u2013 is that a tree\u2019s appearance changes each time we look at it from a new spot; a tree\n  gradually metamorphoses as we take each step. So far, so simple, but on more than one occasion this lesson did not go exactly as I had expected.\n\nThe aim of these courses is for me to help people see the world through a different lens to the one they are used to \u2013 a very specific natural navigation lens. The walks allow me to show\n  students some of the things that practised observation can reveal in this one discipline, and the best places to look for them. The embarrassing truth is that during the visual experiment above, in\n  the very short walk from one perspective point to another, which I know very well, I have had my own partial vision demonstrated to me. On various occasions, I have had an orchid, a fossilized\n  animal and a bird of prey \u2013 a red kite \u2013 pointed out to me by other specialists. All these things I had failed to pick out through my lens of the moment. There were certainly\n  innumerable other things that everyone in each group overlooked.\n\nWhat is the broader lesson? I think that a focused interest is a two-edged sword: it allows us to notice many things that pass others by, but it narrows the spotlight of our vision. A keen\n  passion for one area of nature will definitely encourage you to spot many things, but not everything. To use both edges of this sword in a positive way, we need to develop our interests, but then\n  remain conscious of the blind spots these might introduce.\n\nNatural navigation has made me weak at noticing some insects, but I am usually the first in a group to spot a planet at dusk. A forager will spot the ripening red on a bush before the tracker,\n  but the tracker will notice the tiny thread of fur hanging off a thorn next to it. Staring into the distance, a sailor will notice the coming wind-change painted in the clouds, as the soldier spots\n  the glint reflected off binoculars on the hill below them.\n\nExperience will also teach us how the world appears differently with changes in light and the angle of the sun. Sailors learn to look \u2018down-sun\u2019 (with the sun behind you) when\n  searching for something at sea, otherwise the glare blots everything out, but to look \u2018up-moon\u2019 as this is the best way to pick out detail in the low moonlight. Trackers like to look at\n  details on the ground \u2018up-sun\u2019 as this casts more helpful shadows. Natural navigators know that you get the shortest shadows from a stick in the middle of the day, when the sun is\n  highest, and that these cast a perfect north\u2013south shadow line.\n\nIn time, everybody learns their own way to read the shift in shade, shadow and colour as the day and year progress. We can all appreciate the way flowers appear differently in the diffuse light\n  of a spring morning than they do in the more intense sunlight of midday in summer.\n\nIt is a very rewarding exercise to do the same walk repeatedly, but with a different focus each time. (I sometimes like to put a different book in my backpack on each walk.\n  Very often I don\u2019t get it out at all, it just sits there and silently reminds me of the area I\u2019m trying to focus on.) Then, allow a little time to pass and return to the walk without a\n  specific focus or aim, but to enjoy a richer experience than you had on any one occasion previously.\n\nHearing\n\nBefore we analyse our sense of hearing it is worth doing another quick exercise.\n\nExercise 10\n\nStand outside and listen for one minute. Note down everything you hear.\n\nOur sense of hearing is considered the weaker sense, but it has one very big advantage over sight: it is far less focused directionally. You can hear something that you cannot\n  see \u2013 something behind your head, for example. Every moment outdoors is an opportunity to build an aural landscape, and it is possible to do this without consciously searching for\n  anything.\n\nAn interest in what your ears are trying to describe for you will lead you to many discoveries that would otherwise go unnoticed, and this art of listening is likely to follow a progression:\n\n1. We notice certain sounds and listen attentively to them for the first time.\n\n2. We build a picture of the constant sounds, the fluctuating sounds and the intermittent sounds.\n\n3. We identify the sounds.\n\n4. We build a relationship between our location and these sounds.\n\n5. We mentally map the territory through sound.\n\n6. We learn how the map changes with time.\n\nListening for one minute, we might notice the following sounds: birdsong, the low rumble of a distant motorway, the wind in the trees. Each of these sounds is trying to enrich\n  our understanding of our location. There is information about time of day, time of year, local animals, present and future weather, navigation clues and human behaviour.\n\nAs with what we see, each person\u2019s experience and focus will lead them to create a different picture. The birdwatcher may make the following assessment: \u2018There is a lot of birdsong,\n  which I would expect at this time of day and year. I can hear the song of two distant male chiffchaffs. That means I must be standing close to the border of each male\u2019s territory. I am\n  standing at the Checkpoint Charlie for chiffchaffs. This means that whichever way I walk I will move into one of their territories and away from the other\u2019s.\u2019\n\nThe barefoot weather forecaster may note: \u2018I can hear the wind rustling the trees to the northeast. A wind blowing from the northeast is not typical; the prevailing direction in the UK is\n  from the southwest. This means that, although it is settled at the moment, I can expect unusual weather and a likely drop in temperature very soon, as cold air from over the continent reaches\n  us.\u2019\n\nDuring some courses I like to lead people through dense woodland twice, once before an eyes-closed listening exercise and once after it. In the first patch of woodland, I ask everyone to close\n  their eyes and spin themselves round, up to the point where they are totally disorientated, but still standing up. Then, with their eyes still shut, I ask them to point north. Few succeed. I have\n  ensured that there is no bright sunlight, detectable breeze, land gradient or other non-visual clues to help them. There is one clue, but few tune into it without being prompted. The natural\n  navigator needs to note similar things to both the birder and the forecaster, but also make a mental note of the direction of man-made noises \u2013 in this case, the motorway.\n\nOn the second walk through woodland, after making sure that everyone has noted that the dull distant murmur of the motorway is to the north, everyone can point north with their eyes closed\n  effortlessly.\n\nListening attentively is a habit that is transferable into new areas. For example, if you listen carefully for a few weeks at home, you might start to become familiar with the bark of your\n  neighbour\u2019s dog. It might be possible to refine the art, so that you can distinguish between the bark that means another animal is passing by, and the bark that means that it is dinner time.\n  You might even be able to distinguish between the bark that means a person is passing and one that means a person with a dog on a lead is passing.\n\nOnce you start listening in this way, you make many fresh discoveries and find new heroes. There are blind people who can describe a street by listening to the echoes of the clicks they make\n  with their tongue. I love the way bakers pull a sponge from the oven and then lower an ear to the browning surface of the mixture to listen for gas escaping, or the old-timer mechanics who can\n  identify the spark-plug that needs changing by cocking one ear.\n\nOne consequence of listening carefully is that we tend to become more aware of the creatures that can hear us too, including other people. If you are keeping a\n  \u2018listening watch\u2019, you will notice the approach of other people before they become aware of your presence. This becomes a matter of pride for some.\n\nYou will also notice how silence reduces the likelihood of animals scarpering before you hear them, and therefore improves your chances of detecting them. The number of deer you see on a group\n  walk will be inversely proportional to the number of people having a conversation. Squirrels in a wood, for example, tend to smell or hear us, then see us, then bound away across the forest floor\n  to a tree-trunk escape. All we hear is the last rustle of leaves, like audible dust on our horizon. If you stay both still and silent, however, then the tables are often turned, especially in the\n  case of upwind animals, and you get to see the creatures doing their work instead of hotfooting it. The American Indian technique of \u2018still-hunting\u2019, picking a spot and waiting silently\n  for prey to find you, is just as effective when your intention is observation.\n\nAs our understanding of the way animals listen grows, we may ask ourselves the question: what do plants hear? Every year it seems there are more newspaper stories about the music plants\n  prefer; there was even one recently about their favoured regional accent \u2013 Geordie, apparently. I hate to be the one to bang a loud cymbal and smash these notions, but there is no scientific\n  evidence of plants reacting to music or noise of any kind. None. They are deaf. If that saddens you, then feel free to let your emotions go; the sound of your weeping will not slow the growth of\n  the forest.\n\nIt is impossible to hear the same soundtrack twice outdoors. If we think we do, then it is just a sign that we are not focusing on what we hear. Our sensitivity to time is one\n  measure of our sense of hearing. We will hear the minutes passing in the coming and going of creatures, the hours passing in the rise and fall of birdsong, and the months passing as every single\n  sound shifts: the wind we hear in the trees changes as the leaves fall, and the sounds of our footsteps ebb with each fall of rain or snow.\n\nThe years pass and this is marked sadly by the fall in skylark song or, more cheerfully, by a new neighbourly owl.\n\nExercise 11\n\nStand outside, where you stood before, and listen for one minute. Note down everything you hear and the conclusions you are able to make. Forecast the weather, map the human\n      and bird territories, point north with your eyes closed, but lack not ambition!\n\nThere were two people listening to nature today and they were both you, but one ought to be quietly impressed by the other.\n\nSmell, Taste and Touch\n\nOur nostrils contain clocks and calendars. I know this is true and if I forget it, then I will be reminded when, for instance, each nostril chimes together one June twilight\n  with a honeysuckle waft. Our mouths struggle to keep up, but they can sometimes pick up the passing of the months in the sugars in the fruits. We taste the year passing in apples that roll from\n  wincing sour to tongue-tickling sweet.\n\nOur experience of smell and taste are intertwined and each is hardwired into an interesting part of our brains. These are the only two senses connected directly to our hippocampus, where our\n  long-term memory resides. All other senses are routed via different parts and get processed elsewhere before finding their way to the hippocampus. A photograph of our schooldays will not whisk us\n  back to that time as fast as the smell of cut grass and lawnmower exhaust or \u2013 worse, but faster still \u2013 the musty dank of the changing rooms.\n\nAlongside the stinging nettle, we all quickly learn to recognize brambles. It is hard sometimes to persuade children to pause a moment to admire the colours of an early purple orchid, but when\n  they have been snared and scratched by brambles a few times they are happy to conduct their own lessons in awareness: \u2018Watch out! Let\u2019s find another way.\u2019\n\nFortunately when we are young we are resilient and have deep wells of enthusiasm to draw on. Our next lesson, after a bramble scratch, might be to trip over an inconspicuous root and feel that\n  sore marker of youth: cold wet mud congealing on raw red palms. Our sense of touch begins with these painful reminders, but as our experience grows we use it to swerve around the most dramatic\n  sensations and look for subtler triggers. We come to know that a teasel will tickle but not hurt and that each tree\u2019s bark feels different, from the aloof flat coolness of a beech to the warm\n  corkiness of a field maple.\n\nHuman touch is one of the most intimate experiences. We are all aware of the rules of engagement regarding touch with other people. A hand placed on someone\u2019s shoulder is different to a\n  hand on the waist and the potential for clear and mixed signals is well known. Animals in the wild rarely let us touch them, and plants seem oblivious; but we can be surprised by both. One of my\n  fondest memories is of a tame squirrel, made fearless by the number of walkers that must have passed the same way, climbing up my leg and drinking from the water bottle that rested on my knee.\n\nBut what about these nonchalant plants? Any that react to our presence have the potential to intrigue. Experiments have shown that the majority of plants will react adversely to repetitive\n  touching. Trees that are repeatedly buffeted by the wind will grow shorter and stouter trunks than sheltered ones, leading to wedge-shaped copses on hillsides. But like people, some plants are more\n  sensitive than others. The burr cucumber is ten times more sensitive to touch than humans. Scientists have shown that these vines will grow towards the lightest of touches of a piece of string.\n  This is biologically very impressive, but as animals we are unlikely to be bowled over by such slow reactions: it is visible movement that we react to most strongly.\n\nThe Mimosa pudica grows in the Americas and is both very sensitive to touch and willing to show it. If you touch the Mimosa pudica, its leaflets rapidly recoil, folding inwards\n  and then drooping. The pudica part of the name is a clue \u2013 it means \u2018shy\u2019 in Latin. Its names in Hebrew and Bengali translate as \u2018don\u2019t touch me\u2019 and\n  the \u2018shy virgin\u2019 respectively and respectably.\n\nWe can remind ourselves of the power of touch by closing our eyes again. The blind, as is so often the case, lead the way in this field. A Braille wristwatch has been developed that allows a\n  blind person to tell the time with their fingers, but for many blind people these prove unnecessary as they are already able to tell the time with a broader sense of touch. By remaining sensitive\n  to shifts in sunlight angles, temperatures and the atmosphere, these individuals have a sense of time that is more \u2018real\u2019 than numbers.\n\nTrees that are repeatedly buffeted by the wind will grow shorter and stouter trunks than sheltered ones, leading to wedge-shaped copses on hillsides.\n\nExploring the senses means investigating a range of ideas, techniques and experiences. When new to any of these it is best to absorb and practise them in isolated ways. When we\n  are comfortable with them individually, we can bring several together in one experience. The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nSoon we experience the outdoors in a way that makes our earlier view of it seem a pale imitation. Edward O. Wilson described the higher awareness that it is possible to achieve as the\n  \u2018naturalists\u2019 trance\u2019, whereby biologists are able to locate more elusive organisms. We can all use it to hunt the most elusive of creatures: the perfect nature experience.",

      "content": "# 3. The Big Relationships\n\n\u2018Hirsute Highland heifers graze in fields greener than guacamole.\u2019\n\n(ALAN TAYLOR)\n\nThere is a lot of stuff out there. Mostly green stuff, with a few other scattered colours and, at first, none of it seems to betray to the viewer a lot of thought in the\n  way it has been scattered.\n\nIf you have a space in your house where you chuck things that have no other logical home \u2013 a big cupboard, an attic, an entire garage \u2013 then you will know the feeling I am referring\n  to here. The one that comes from being confronted with a lot of stuff with no apparent beauty, system, method, purpose or allure. This feeling of mild dread sits close to the sensation of watching\n  the contents of a full bin-bag empty onto the floor through a tear in the bottom. It is the feeling of being gently overwhelmed by chaos, and nobody likes to be overwhelmed. (Whelmed, yes;\n  but overwhelmed, less so.)\n\nWhen our initial enthusiasm for nature in theory collides with the real thing, it is hard not to feel daunted. A metaphorical skip into the delights of the outdoors becomes a slow crash of\n  realization . . . \u2018Is there no end to all this random matter?\u2019 This is a normal reaction and not an unhealthy one. It does at least mean we have noticed some of the detail in our\n  surroundings, but it also hints at the challenge ahead.\n\nIf we look at one example from the plant kingdom, and then one from the animal, we will see the scale of this challenge.\n\nOrchids are one member of one branch of the flower family. There are 25,000 different species of orchid alone. No typo, 25k. If, each day, you took it upon yourself to study and\n  understand one orchid, it would take 68.5 years before you had covered this one species. You could then move on to the daisies.\n\nIn 1995 a team of scientists travelled to Panama and studied a group of nineteen trees, looking for beetles. They found them. The scientists identified 1,200 species of beetles, and of these,\n  960 were new to science.\n\nThere really is a lot of stuff out there.\n\nHow do we begin to convert a sense of being daunted into one of connection? The key is to start at the opposite end of the scale. We must forget individual species to begin with, and focus our\n  interest more broadly. By building a simple collection of general insights, and leaving species out of the mix for now, the outdoors morphs from stuff to shape, and from seeming\n  randomness to apparent patterns. Think of the progression in this way:\n\nInitial confusion \u2192 Recognizing landscapes and habitats \u2192 Knowing what to expect in each habitat \u2192 Recognizing fine connections and any anomalies\n\nIn this chapter we are going to look at a total of fifteen building blocks. If these are new to you, that might seem like a lot. But give them a chance, as they can help\n  explain almost everything you see in nature. Besides, the alternative is to start at page 1 of an orchid book that weighs half a ton.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some of the simplest of these building blocks:\n\n1. All animals, humans included, need water. Water sources increase the local populations of animals, and the presence of animals often indicates the presence of water\n      nearby. London would not exist without the Thames.\n\n2. Plants can survive on basic chemical nutrients \u2013 air, sunlight and minerals \u2013 but all animals need to eat other living things. They need food in the form of\n      plants or other animals.\n\n3. Animals that eat plants tend towards living in groups: there is usually no shortage of plant matter, and they benefit from having more eyes to look out for\n      predators.\n\n4. Predators tend to work alone if they are going for small prey or in packs if they are going after very large prey.\n\nNow we can deduce that if we see an animal, it follows that there must be some water and a specific food source in the form of a plant or another animal very nearby. If we add\n  some more building blocks the picture starts to get a little more interesting:\n\n5. In the wild, given enough time, trees will come to dominate all land, outside of extreme regions like the Arctic or high mountains.\n\n6. Most plants, including young trees, cannot survive being bitten down to ground level. Grasses are one of the most significant exceptions: their bud \u2013 the part of\n      the plant needed for new growth \u2013 is below the surface and survives grazing.\n\n7. Life is tough for all wild plants and animals, and they are very sensitive to their environment. They have each evolved to out-compete other species if environmental\n      conditions \u2013 i.e. habitat \u2013 are suitable, but struggle if they are not.\n\nThe simple concepts above explain the appearance of the landscapes we see.\n\nExercise 12\n\nIn this exercise we are going to see building-block 5 in action.\n\nLook at the photo of a mountain below. Notice the way you can spot different habitats as you look from the bottom to the top. Deciduous trees thrive in the warm sheltered valley, these give\n      way to conifers a little higher up, then a little higher the conditions are too hard and all the trees give up at the \u2018treeline\u2019. Above this, the hardier shrubs like gorse and\n      heather take over, and going higher still, only the hardiest grasses survive and these will continue up to the snowline, if a mountain is high enough. Each plant has thrived within its own\n      microhabitat, and none of them could survive within each other\u2019s for long.\n\nPlant life changes dependably with altitude, giving us nature\u2019s altimeter.\n\nThe beauty of this simple way of looking at habitats on a mountain is that it will work all over the world, with no knowledge of individual species. It is one of the best ways of forming a\n      small instant connection with a landscape. In natural navigation terms, this is nature\u2019s altimeter.\n\nBefore agriculture came onto the scene about six thousand years ago, woodland dominated the British Isles. To look after livestock and sow crops, it was necessary to clear the\n  woodland. The result is what we see today, a tussle between humans, woodland, edible crops, grazing animals and grasses.\n\nThe next time you pass through a variety of inland rural landscapes in a car or train, notice how every single one of these landscapes can be explained by the principles above.\n\nEverywhere you look, you will see one or more of four things:",

      "content": "## 3. Animals grazing grasses\n\n4. Built-up areas\n\nThis is the first stage in identifying habitats. It sounds obvious, and it is, but there is an important distinction between seeing a sheep and understanding a sheep\u2019s\n  place in the scheme of things. The person whose thought process stops with the less-than-dramatic thought, \u2018There is a sheep and some trees\u2019, has clearly not made the same connection\n  with their surroundings as the person who thinks: \u2018There is a sheep; it is a herbivore and likes to live in a flock; there are likely to be lots more. There they are. I wonder why there is a\n  small copse of young trees in the middle of their grassy field? Oh I see now, there is a fence around it stopping the sheep grazing there and killing the saplings . . . But, I wonder why the farmer\n  fenced this area off in the first place . . .\u2019\n\nOnce we are used to seeing the landscape as a series of habitats, we can begin to ask and answer more interesting questions. And we will find a large number of the answers by\n  thinking about water and rocks.\n\nFirst we need to clear up a big misconception. There is a temptation to think of places as being different because they are in different places. The Lake District is like the Lake District\n  because it is . . . the Lake District. Yosemite National Park is like Yosemite National Park because it is Yosemite National Park. Beneath the ludicrousness of these statements lurks something big\n  and key.\n\nRocks and water explain a lot about every natural environment, regardless of where they are. Time for our final set of building blocks:\n\n8. All land is based on rocks of some kind.\n\n9. Some rocks, like chalk, are porous and some, like slate, are non-porous. Non-porous rocks hold water above them and lead to wet areas. Porous rocks let the water filter\n      down through them and lead to dry areas.\n\n10. Some plants and animals like wet conditions and some like drier conditions.\n\n11. Some rocks, like granite, lead to soil above them that is acidic and some, like chalk, form soil that is alkaline.\n\n12. Most plants prefer alkaline conditions, so you get more plants and more diverse plants growing in areas with alkaline soils.\n\n13. Rivers carve V-shaped valleys and meander, creating interlocking spurs that result in restricted views. During the last ice age, on the other hand, glaciers carved big,\n      wide U-shaped valleys with great views.\n\n14. Where the sea meets land, the wind creates waves and constant erosion. Depending on the rocks it acts upon, this process gives us beaches, cliffs and many more\n      beguiling landforms.\n\n15. The side of a landmass closest to the sea, in the direction the wind comes from, will get most of the rain. The weather in the UK arrives from the west: Wales is a lot\n      wetter than East Anglia, which is on average 34 per cent drier than the rest of England and Wales.\n\nGranted, that\u2019s quite a few building blocks, but by using them you can not only understand habitats, but you can predict the things you will find in them. This is because\n  once you are aware of these very broad characteristics \u2013 acid or alkaline, wet or dry, river or glacier country \u2013 then suddenly the green chaos starts to organize itself before your\n  eyes.\n\nThe habits of some familiar animals and plants are well known to us. For instance, most people know that cows are rarely found in the middle of the woods, but that shade-loving fungi thrive\n  there.\n\nQuite quickly, we can appreciate that every single animal and plant is an \u2018indicator\u2019 of some sort; it is trying to tell us something about the environment. Frogs and dragonflies\n  live in still, freshwater habitats, so you will not find them far from lakes and ponds. Some plants, like heather, love direct sunlight, so you will tend to find them on south-facing slopes. Once\n  we add all these indicators together we form a beautifully intricate picture of the place where we find ourselves. And the reason we find ourselves there is not usually a coincidence; it is\n  connected to the landscape\u2019s intricacy.\n\nThe Lake District in the UK is a popular destination, and its many visitors go there not because it is conveniently situated, but \u2013 indirectly \u2013 because it is comprised of a lot of\n  non-porous rocks and has been shaped by glaciers. The glacial ice formed big U-shaped valleys, and the water that collects in these valleys can\u2019t get down through the rocks at the bottom and\n  so collects to form picturesque lakes. The poetry of Wordsworth, Coleridge and hundreds of others has been inspired by the Lake District\u2019s dramatic views, and these have been sculpted by\n  rocks, ice and water.\n\nGranite creates acidic soils and is non-porous, so we find wet inhospitable conditions above granite. Mosses are one of the few plants that can thrive in such conditions, and over many years the\n  mosses are compressed down to form peat. So, granite creates a boggy, peaty wilderness we have come to call a moor. Dartmoor is the way it is because of the granite below the surface.\n\nThe sorts of habitats we are likely to encounter are:\n\n\u2022 Grasslands\n\n\u2022 Shrublands\n\n\u2022 Woodlands\n\n\u2022 Wetlands\n\n\u2022 Coastal\n\n\u2022 Rocky\n\n\u2022 Artificial \u2013 from farmland to urban\n\nWithin each of these, the rock below the surface and the actions of the water on that rock will create more specific types of habitat. Limestone will support deciduous forests,\n  while sandy soils often lie under pine forests.\n\nThe reward for recognizing habitats is that this makes the next stage in connecting with nature much more straightforward. Habitats are like large houses with several extended families living in\n  them. We know that when we go to visit Aunt Jane, there is a high probability that we will also see Uncle John. And so it is with wild habitats: if we are on a chalk hill we can expect to see beech\n  trees, which love alkaline conditions and dry soils, but we should not expect to see many alder trees, which hate dry soil and love their roots to be surrounded by water.\n\nSoon the tangled masses we once saw are revealed as part of a simple system. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, we see order; the plants and animals not only sort themselves into easy-to-understand\n  groups, but allow us to have a lot of fun in making predictions and doing detective work.\n\nExercise 13\n\nNow it is your turn. Think back to the field with the sheep and the fenced-off young trees. After a squint through the train\u2019s window you notice that the field is\n      lined with beech trees, but the fenced-off trees in the middle are alders. Use the information in this chapter to predict one flying creature you might encounter, if you walked from the edge to\n      the centre of the field in summer.\n\nAnswer: The alders in the centre of the field hint that there is water there. The farmer has probably fenced off a pond to keep livestock safely out of it. This has also kept the grazing\n      sheep away from the vulnerable saplings and allowed the young alders to thrive. You might encounter a number of flying insects in these conditions, but the one hinted at earlier in this chapter\n      was dragonflies.\n\nThe sheep explain the landscape. The chalk explains the beech trees, but the alders hint at a different microhabitat, and this in turn suggests the animals we might encounter. The network is\n      slowly building.",

WILSON)\n\nWe tend to become familiar with our home habitats first and the regulars that will be found there. This familiarity is what makes it easy to spot change. Think of your\n  favourite song, one you know off by heart and have listened to a thousand times. If an artist released a remix of this song, the change would be instantly noticeable to you \u2013 it might even\n  jar. But to someone who was unfamiliar with the original, the new version would be harder to distinguish. Once we learn to recognize the background sounds, we start to pick out each new note\n  instinctively.\n\nI live in the South Downs; it is chalk country and beech forests abound. Inevitably, I have become familiar with the dependable cohorts of these shady woodlands: grey squirrels, deer, pheasants,\n  orchids and the beech-loving fungi, like the saffrondrop bonnet, Mycena crocata. These organisms form the expected canvas, but I will be quickly intrigued by anything that stands out as\n  less than common. A pheasant will not drag my eyes upwards for long, but a white-tailed eagle would.\n\nNature is a series of specialists and their partners. Fungi and forests work in tandem; vast subterranean networks of fungi fix nitrogen for the trees that offer the perfect habitat for them. If\n  we spot the specialist, we will likely find the partner. For example, the cinnabar moth caterpillar can only feed on ragwort, so if we spot one, we can be confident of finding the other.\n\nFrom the rodents that colonize the London Underground, through the \u2018railway poplars\u2019 that screen many urban railway lines, to the bright green lichens that cling to the wind-scoured\n  rocks of the mountains of north Wales \u2013 no habitat is off-limits to the inquisitive mind looking for specialist species. Studies have been done into the microhabitats that are cemeteries and,\n  rather wonderfully for lovers of all things vampire, these areas have been found to offer important insect-rich feeding areas for bats.\n\nIf you spend enough time in a place, the regulars introduce themselves, and their reason for choosing that place is usually easy to work out. Sometimes it is a little trickier, but then the\n  sport of puzzle-solving commences. There is a peculiar satisfaction in cracking nature\u2019s riddles: why do these pigeons always use exactly the same flightpath? Aha! They are following the road\n  below. Pigeons, like many other birds, follow lines in the ground like motorways and rivers.\n\nWhen the shapes and colours of a habitat become familiar to us and the individual species attract our curiosity, we will be confronted with an important and much-dreaded\n  hurdle: species identification and names. More people have felt an early interest in nature snuffed out by the tyranny of species names than probably any other single factor.\n\nDepending on your experience, you may have sensed a mild dismay on encountering the Latin name of the fungus, Mycena crocata, at the start of this chapter. I deliberately squeezed it in\n  there to help make this point. I don\u2019t know whether it is the way many subjects are taught at school that sows a long-term loathing of such things, but most people find subjects with a lot of\n  new names forbidding. The study of the natural world is absolutely stuffed with them: common names, Latin names, nicknames and names that are impossible to pronounce. But however unpalatable the\n  words Mycena crocata may be at first, we do need some way of differentiating between species.\n\nIf names feel like a stumbling block, then there are a couple of fun ways around this problem. Firstly, banish fear of getting something wrong, because it is impossible. There are no rights or\n  wrongs, just invented words. Names are a convention, a very useful one for many of us at times, but if they are not proving useful for you at any one time, then they serve no purpose at that\n  moment. The only time you are likely to fear getting a name wrong is when you are trying to convey the identity of something to another person, and there are many other ways of doing this. If you\n  want to call something \u2018that stringy green thingy with a white flower that looks like a gramophone\u2019, then that is as correct as calling it hedge bindweed or Convolvulus sepium,\n  for that matter. After a few times using that long expression, you may start to see a little beauty in the shorter names, but if not, so be it!\n\nSadly, the natural world is not short of people who believe that rattling off Latin names incessantly makes them appear clever, whereas most of us know instinctively that this suggests\n  insecurity at best, but possibly social and sexual dysfunction as well. If somebody corrects you sternly by using an obtuse name for something, they probably know neither human nature nor any other\n  kind very profoundly.\n\nWhen I teach people how to use the stars to find their way, one of the first things I say is, \u2018Shapes and the way these shapes move in the sky are very important for natural navigators.\n  Names never have been and never will be. Call it the Plough, the Big Dipper, the Saucepan or part of Ursa Major \u2013 you will not change the way it looks or the way it can be used to find the\n  North Star.\u2019\n\nThe second fun way to beat names at their own game is to don a deerstalker hat, light a pipe and enjoy the clues within. The common names of most plants and animals will contain interesting\n  indicators as to the characteristics of their owners, and these can offer rewarding insight. Instead of viewing names as an obstacle to experience, with practice they come to be seen as a gateway.\n  The saffrondrop bonnet fungus mentioned earlier bleeds a rich orange when bruised, and once you have seen the gore of this orange blood you are unlikely to forget this fungus or its name\n  quickly.\n\nNames are dead words until we find meaning in them, but as soon as we do, the species behind them can find new life in our imagination. Take the words \u2018ghost orchid\u2019. We may know\n  what an orchid is and we may be familiar, from Scooby Doo if nowhere else, with what a ghost is. However, \u2018ghost orchid\u2019 isn\u2019t likely to stick in our minds for long\n  unless we find some meaning to that pairing. If a friend returns from a walk in the woods and announces that they saw a roe deer, a brown owl and a ghost orchid, then they may possibly be a little\n  underwhelmed by our response of, \u2018That\u2019s nice.\u2019\n\nOnce we learn that ghost orchids earned their name because they are one of the rarest plants in Britain and can disappear from a site for whole decades at a time, before reappearing briefly, the\n  name comes to life a bit. The next time someone announces they have seen a ghost orchid, we can oblige them by falling off our chair in the expected manner.\n\nFinding the North Star.\n\nIt is a privilege to see a very rare plant or animal, but that does not on its own give us a connection. It might be a good idea for us to draw a couple of the strands together at this point.\n  Imagine you are walking down a country lane in May and someone next to you points to a yellow flower and says, \u2018Look, St John\u2019s wort is out already,\u2019 you should not feel ashamed\n  to find yourself unmoved. Nor is there any need to offer a gruff retort in the form of, \u2018Do I look bothered?\u2019 Instead, take a moment to look at the flower, enjoy peering at its little\n  yellow spikes and then, at your leisure, investigate the name. The next time you walk down that same country lane you will be able to turn to a new walking companion and explain that St\n  John\u2019s wort earned its name because it was traditionally known to flower on St John\u2019s day, 24 June. The flower\u2019s Latin name, Hypericum perforatum, makes more sense once\n  you have held one of its leaves up to the light. They have small oil glands in them, which do give them a perforated appearance. The word Hypericum comes from the Greek words\n  hyper and eikon, \u2018above\u2019 and \u2018picture\u2019, from the tradition of hanging a plant over a picture to ward off evil on St John\u2019s Day, this being a plant\n  that has a reputation for doing just that. St John\u2019s wort is widely used to treat depression, and there is scientific evidence backing its use for certain cases.\n\nIf your friend finds this interesting, you might choose to reveal the fruits of your further research. It was once believed that a childless woman could walk out naked to pick the St\n  John\u2019s wort flower, and this would lead to her conceiving within a year. And if your friend raises an eyebrow, you might add, \u2018However, it is possible that the flower played only a\n  small part in these fertility trials: walking about naked in midsummer might have been a good way of introducing new mates into the equation. Varieties like winter heliotrope are unlikely to have\n  earned such a reputation, as naked rambling in December might be considered mad, not licentious.\u2019\n\nThe elusive ghost orchid.\n\nBy this point there is a danger that your companion will be making judgments about your own social skills, so it will be time to move on to the next exhibit.\n\nYou will, however, have demonstrated to your own satisfaction that, with a little curiosity, dead words spring to life and the name of this one plant allows us to feel a connection with history,\n  medicine and sex. The name has allowed it to metamorphose in our minds from a yellow flower into a calendar and then a pharmacy.\n\nNature is often like a painting that seems dull until you start to learn more about it. Van Gogh added yet more piquancy to the vibrancy of his art by cutting off part of his ear. His paintings\n  change in our minds, without changing physically, when we learn more about the story that surrounds them.\n\nTake a look at the two flightless birds on the opposite page and assess how you feel looking at these two creatures. Granted these are motionless black-and-white photographs, but it is hard to\n  feel for either subject in each case.\n\nLet me give you a little backstory on these two birds. The first, the male emperor penguin, will allow his hungry partner to go off and feed after she has laid the egg, while he fasts so that he\n  can protect their egg for four months. He will endure winds of 120 mph and temperatures that fall to lower than \u201340\u00b0c. He is the only male penguin to do this without help from the\n  female.\n\nA penguin and a cassowary. Do you feel anything?\n\nThe second, the cassowary, is another large flightless bird. Its second \u2018toe\u2019 is a lethal nail-like spike that can tear flesh \u2013 a cassowary once killed a 16-year-old boy by\n  piercing his neck. Look back at the photographs. It is a little easier to feel something with some background. You can see it in their eyes now, can\u2019t you?\n\nNo longer intimidated by apparent disorder, it is time to heighten the senses, to detect the anomalous: peer deeper, listen more hungrily and sniff for change. We are at the\n  stage where we can look forward to fresh discoveries, to finding new keys to unlock our surroundings.\n\nThe competitive pressure of survival is tough on new life, but kind to the naturalist, because it means that each species we find has a story to reveal about the place where we stand and the\n  time we spend there. If we walk through a dense woodland we will not be surprised to find plants that can thrive in the shade. In spring we might be treated to a carpet of bluebells, but alert\n  senses may help us to spot stronger clues to time and place.\n\nThe winter aconite flower is an early bloomer, as its name suggests, but getting to know this flower reveals more than a clue to the time of year. If, peering closely, we notice its petals\n  furled in the early morning and unfurled in the afternoon, we can take some satisfaction in having observed one of nature\u2019s many thermometers: the winter aconite\u2019s petals only open when\n  the air temperature rises above 10\u00b0c.\n\nIn another patch we may find wood anemone, wood sorrel and woodruff. Each of these plants is a poor colonizer and together they indicate that a woodland habitat is ancient. A picture begins to\n  build of place and time, one that has always been there, but which is seen by few, or, as the French philosopher Henri Bergson put it, \u2018Disorder is simply the order we are not looking\n  for.\u2019\n\nOur senses can also reveal which animals have come to share each moment with us. There is a strong tradition of \u2018birding by ear\u2019, that is, identifying birds by their calls and then\n  building a picture of a territory by the sounds of the birds. This may sound steeply technical at first, but it is accessible and fun to try. The full art takes years to hone, but the general\n  approach can be understood with the help of a few words. The yellowhammer calls with a rhythm that can be evoked with the sentence, \u2018a little bit of bread and no cheese\u2019.\n\nStrange, but you get the sound-picture. And the name-detective in you may already have deduced that this is indeed a bird with yellow feathers: hama is an Old English word for skin,\n  covering or feathers.\n\nThere are other word games that can help us build a different picture. \u2018Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain\u2019 will win few prizes as a history lesson, but it works better as a neat\n  way of remembering the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet sequence in a rainbow. No matter how many times I see a rainbow, I still love checking the outcome of that particular\n  conflict. History does indeed repeat itself.\n\nEars and eyes cocked to the skies for birdsong and rainbows, we may find our feet trying to tell us about a much smaller creature. It is common in summer to find a stickiness on the ground under\n  Lime trees. This is the work of the aphids that gorge on the tree\u2019s sap and then drop the excess sugars below them as a honeydew. There are moulds that thrive on these sugars and form dark\n  patches on cars that park regularly under lime trees. Note to selves: do not park under trees with leaves that are heart-shaped with toothed edges.\n\nAlmost everything that our senses pick out is eager to tell us a story that will help us make a connection. The constellation Hercules is itching to boast all about the times he slayed a lion,\n  an eagle and a swan. These victims will be found in the nearby constellations of Leo, Aquila and Cygnus. The plant Danish scurvy-grass, which tolerates salt, earned its name after it was eaten by\n  sailors returning from long periods at sea to satisfy their mortal craving for vitamin C. It has more recently come to colonize the verges of major roads, where we have accidentally created coastal\n  conditions by spreading salt in winter.\n\nIt does not take an encyclopaedic list to demonstrate that these finer connections are out there, everywhere, waiting for us to find them. The important thing for us to remember is that nature\n  is a set of keys and interlocking connections. It sometimes takes a little patience to work out how to open a new lock, but the keys are there and the reward on the other side is a recipe for a\n  form of alchemy. Once we see the way all of nature is interconnected we have a way of turning time in the fresh air into a richness of experience. And, unlike the alchemy of old, it works.",

      "content": "# 5. The Beauty of Conflict\n\nSweet are the uses of adversity,\n\nWhich, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\n\nWears yet a precious jewel in his head.\n\n(As You Like It, ACT II, SCENE I, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE)\n\nEach species that thrives is well suited to its environment, but this is not a situation that has been arrived at by benign committee. It is the result of violent, unceasing\n  conflict.\n\nParasitoid wasps lay eggs in caterpillars and then paralyse their host with a poison. The wasp eggs hatch within the caterpillar, then slowly begin to eat it, but they like to keep their victim\n  alive for as long as possible. They start eating the fatty parts of the caterpillar first, then move on to some of the organs, leaving the central nervous system and heart until last.\n\nSparrowhawks spear pretty tits, and even those models of outdoors citizenry, trees, devise ingenious manoeuvres to outwit each other, each one responding to the shade of their neighbours as they\n  grow. This is not a game.\n\nIn 1685 a clan chief from the island of North Rona in the Hebrides returned from time at sea to find that his once-busy home island was desolate. A single lonely and skeletal woman greeted him\n  on the beach, and he soon learned that the rest of his people had starved to death. Somehow, black rats had found their way onto the island and into the islanders\u2019 vital food stores. In the\n  battle for resources we call winter, the rats had won.\n\nFor tens of thousands of years human beings woke in the morning with a simple game plan: win today\u2019s wrestle with nature and tomorrow can take care of itself. Now that we have proved to\n  ourselves that we can temporarily beat nature in almost any game, we have been left with strange new challenges and quandaries. Or perhaps this environmental anxiety is nature\u2019s most recent\n  cunning ploy: to wrack humans with existential angst so severe that we are eventually pinned down by vines and creepers and then devoured by crows and worse. Time will tell.\n\nWe may find conflict unattractive as a concept, repellent even, but as a mechanism for helping us to connect with nature it is so powerful that it holds a beauty. It is not the conflict itself\n  that will draw us in, but the inevitability that we will find ourselves rooting for one side. Watching my dog walk around our back garden could get boring. Watching one of our chickens potter in\n  one corner of the garden is no more exciting. But running like a maniac to stop my dog from attacking a chicken that has escaped is far from boring.\n\nNews of a knife fight in a distant town is less interesting to the average person than hearing that there has been a squabble between two close relatives. It is likely that a ripple in our own\n  pond will be more significant to us than a great wave in the wider ocean. The knife fight makes the news, because the news is a collection of intense conflict stories. Even the good news tends to\n  be moderated conflict, for instance someone triumphing in a sporting event by thrashing everyone else.\n\nThe variable element that will decide whether a tussle draws us in and encourages us to form a connection will be our level of interest in the individuals or teams concerned. The great\n  naturalist Aldo Leopold summed this concept up concisely and with a breathtaking political incorrectness, even for 1949: \u2018A dead Chinaman is of little import to us whose awareness of things\n  Chinese is bounded by an occasional dish of chow mein.\u2019\n\nThe nature stories that become best known are the conflicts that resonate most strongly and widely.\n\nImagine standing at a window in a town and seeing a squirrel climbing a tree. No connection so far. But then you notice that it is unusually red, and this reminds you of one of the best-known\n  nature conflicts of our islands.\n\nThe grey squirrel was introduced to Britain in 1876. In the early days, they were a rare and welcome sight and they earned lots of fans. Signs appeared in parks with the words, \u2018The public\n  are earnestly requested not to molest the grey squirrels.\u2019\n\nLeaving to one side for a moment the arresting image of what a squirrel-molester might look like, we move on only forty years to find a very different official stance. Grey squirrels had rapidly\n  outcompeted the home side of red squirrels and bred with such vigour that 4,000 were killed in Kew Gardens and the species was deterred from Royal Parks.\n\nThe battle for resources continued through the twentieth century. In 1955, reds were spotted in thirty-three parks in Sheffield. By 1965 they were counted in only four, and 1970 was the last\n  recorded instance of an urban red-squirrel sighting.\n\nSo now . . . imagine you see a red-coloured squirrel climbing a tree from your town window.\n\nThere are other recent big nature stories that are also steeped in conflict. Think of the elms that have been whittled away by Dutch elm disease in recent decades and, at the time of writing,\n  the fear that the ash trees may be about to go the same way at the hands of the fungal disease that is believed to have come from the continent. We live in interesting times if you are a Europhobic\n  arborphile.\n\nThe red squirrels and elms have suffered a drastic decline, because they have been confronted with survival challenges and they are yet to arrive at a solution. Evolution is the sadistic\n  headmaster of the Succeed-or-Die School of Invention, motto: Disce aut consumere! \u2013 \u2018learn or get eaten!\u2019.\n\nIt is sad and sometimes ugly when a species fails in this school, especially ugly if the change they are confronted with is caused by human thoughtlessness. Sometimes the two happen in tandem\n  and ugliness can create unexpected beauty.\n\nNew railway lines are notorious for the havoc and destruction they can bring to a landscape, impacting both natural and artificial environments. However, the need to keep general human traffic\n  away from the iron dragons that pass along these new lines has created a new habitat and led to a renaissance in rare wildflowers in some areas. But perhaps the most surreal and ironic example of\n  this is the fact that many naturalists now support the military\u2019s habit of firing big explosive shells at landscapes. Exploding ordnance falling from the sky has the dependable effect of\n  keeping humans away and, consequently, firing ranges from Devon to Scotland have accidentally created some of the most healthy ecosystems in Britain. Naturalists and the military are now working\n  more closely, and this unlikely partnership is becoming less accidental and more deliberate.\n\nDanger for humans can spell good news for the rest of nature.\n\nNothing intensifies our interest in nature like the subject of human influence: for example, economic growth and planning permission versus ancient woodlands and protected birds. Roll up, roll\n  up, ringside seats available . . . Be warned, by the second round you will probably want to climb between the ropes and give one side a broken nose. Try thinking of your favourite open space and\n  saying the following words dispassionately: \u2018My favourite place to go for a walk may not be ideally suited to a new supermarket.\u2019\n\nSome of nature\u2019s most intriguing displays come when a species prevails in the face of an evolutionary challenge. The carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes\n  pervillei, lures insects into a fluid-filled cup. There they die in an acid bath. Grotesque, effective and simple, so far, but evolution never stands still. Large insects cause the plant\n  problems and foul up its digestive system. There is only one ant that can survive this heinous environment, and it is also the only ant that can swim, the Colobopsis ant. This ant feeds on\n  those larger insects that would otherwise cause problems for the plant. Evolution is exquisite: it creates one ant that can not only swim, but chooses to do its lengths in an acid bath that kills\n  pretty much everything else its size. Here, the ant serenely eats lunch in the shade provided by its gruesome, murderous host.\n\nLettuces form a good lunch for many aphids, but once the lettuces realize they are being attacked by the bingeing aphids, they begin to manufacture a poison to deter them. Thus evolution has\n  devised a cunning counterattack method for the lettuce. This is great, but wouldn\u2019t it be so much better if the plants could detect an attack by an animal before it was launched?\n  Yes, of course, but how could that be possible? The genius of evolution is best seen when it solves problems that humans might struggle with. Think for a moment how you would give a plant a system\n  that allowed it to predict that an animal attack was imminent. Bear in mind that plants have no brain.\n\nScientists have worked out that many plants are able to protect themselves from animal attack by staying finely tuned to the chemicals being produced by other plants. Incredibly, we now know\n  that a plant can pre-empt an attack by an animal, long before it has been attacked itself, by \u2018chemical eavesdropping\u2019. If a poplar tree picks up the scent of other trees being\n  attacked by insects, it produces more of the toxic compounds that inhibit the growth of its enemy, the caterpillar, long before the creatures launch their offensive on that particular tree.\n\nIn any closely matched battle, an arms race of ingenuity is likely. One of the most fun examples of this can be found in the tussle between a giant mammal and a tree. Giraffes in Botswana eat\n  the leaves of acacia trees. The acacia tree is not keen on being completely devoured, and so releases tannins to deter the giraffes. This chemical messenger is picked up by other trees, which\n  pre-empt attack and produce the chemical in anticipation. How do you think the giraffes beat this system?\n\nThe giraffes have learned to eat the acacias starting at the downwind end of a group of acacias. What will the acacias \u2018think\u2019 of next?\n\nConflict in the natural world is not limited to organism versus organism. Life for many creatures and plants is a regular battle against the elements, and many animals find particular seasons\n  precarious. If, during the lean months, the smallest birds encounter a source of food, they must regulate their intake: too little and they will starve, too much and they lose agility and are\n  likely to fall prey.\n\nWhat will the acacias \u2018think\u2019 of next?\n\nThe changing seasons mark a constant shift in opportunities and challenges for most species. It is not as simple as \u2018summer good, winter bad\u2019. While winter means depleted food and\n  harsher weather, many parasites and diseases flourish in the warmth and humidity of summer. Predators and prey find their odds alter with changes in temperature, foliage, food-scarcity, water\n  levels, light levels and their own populations. There is a tendency for us to back the underdog when the going is tough, which is probably why it is so exciting to watch prey escaping during such\n  times. A fall of snow will make it harder for prey like rabbits to hide; who wouldn\u2019t cheer for a rabbit running over snow ahead of a dog? Not everyone would; that\u2019s what makes it\n  interesting.\n\nAnimals have numerous systems for warning them of attack by other animals \u2013 from the neighbourhood-watch system of birds, who make others of their kind aware of danger with their alarm\n  calls, to the small mammals that beat the ground as a warning drum. Nor should we be surprised to find animals and plants communicating with each other about impending battles with the weather.\n  Scientists have noted that pine and oak trees emit ultrasonic vibrations during a drought, as their water-bearing vessels respond to the decrease in available water, and it has even been suggested\n  that other trees are picking up on these signals somehow.\n\nAn appreciation that conflict is an inevitable part of nature can help us to notice and then connect with the supersensitive balance in an area. Any tweak to any variable will tip some species\n  into the ascendant and others into trouble.\n\nThe constant challenge of survival, the same one our not-so-distant ancestors struggled with, might also be the reason why we abhor excessive violence. There is a difference between the demands\n  of survival and gratuitous killing. The fox that systematically slaughters all the chickens and leaves most of them dead, instead of killing and taking just one, makes few friends. The writer Roger\n  Deakin was incensed by the squirrels that laid waste to an excessive number of his walnuts, likening them to the thieves that vandalize a home after burgling it: \u2018Grow up, act your age. Just\n  take what you need and bugger off.\u2019\n\nNoticing the mass conflict around us and finding ourselves taking sides in small battles is an integral part of forming a connection with nature. Anyone who denies this is still waiting to form\n  a connection. We can remain impartial from a distance, but the sight of abundant death has a way of triggering a measure of empathy which grows into a connection, and with this comes a strong\n  interest in the wellbeing of certain animals or plants. The further away the battles take place, the bigger they need to be for most people to become connected. This is why we hear stories about\n  local species, but distant ecosystems.\n\nWe may feel moved by the plight of the whole Amazon rainforest or the single rare bird that visited our back yard once. Scale and proximity will have a bearing on which conflicts trigger our\n  emotions, but once we take sides it is inevitable that we will feel a connection.",

      "content": "# 1. Hidden Calendars\n\n\u2018The Sun, with all those planets revolving around it and dependent on it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else to do.\u2019\n\n(GALILEO GALILEI)\n\nFive hundred years ago, a young girl called Pepita lived in a small village in Mexico. On Christmas Eve, Pepita made her way to church with the other children from the village.\n  She could see that all the others were carrying beautiful gifts for the baby Jesus. Pepita was sad as she did not have enough money to buy even the smallest of gifts for Jesus. Pepita\u2019s\n  cousin, Pedro, put his arm around her shoulders as they walked together,\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Pepita, even the most humble gift, if given in love, will be acceptable in the Lord\u2019s eyes.\u2019\n\nPepita bent down and gathered a small bunch of the green weeds that lined the lane. At the church she placed the green plants at the altar and said her prayers. The other children laughed at\n  her.\n\n\u2018Do you think Jesus wants your weeds, Pepita?\u2019\n\nPepita cried and ran out of the church. She sat on her own and wept, listening to her friends singing inside. Then she walked home all alone.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Pepita and Pedro walked to the church together again, but Pepita refused to go in.\n\n\u2018You go, Pedro, the others will just laugh at me because I am so poor.\u2019\n\nPedro could not persuade his cousin to join him in the church and he went inside, leaving Pepita sitting all alone outside once more.\n\nThen Pedro rushed out.\n\n\u2018Come, Pepita, come! Quick!\u2019\n\nPedro led his cousin back inside the church and pointed towards the altar. The green plants had turned a vibrant red and the whole congregation stood in silence. They were staring in\n  amazement.\n\nThe legend of the poinsettia miracle, like all good legends, contains kernels of truth and insight. Poinsettias are \u2018short-day\u2019 plants, which means they are very\n  sensitive to the number of hours of consecutive darkness they are exposed to.\n\nAs the nights lengthen towards the end of the year, poinsettias turn red. It is actually the leaves of the plant that change colour, although the effect is so vivid that they are regularly\n  confused with flowers.\n\nThe poinsettia has become a plant that is symbolic of Christmas in many parts of the world, and in their native Mexico poinsettias are known as \u2018Flores de Noche Buena\u2019,\n  \u2018Flowers of Christmas Eve\u2019. Commercial growers will manipulate the time at which the plants turn red by controlling the length of night artificially. Home growers can accelerate the\n  change in a similar way, by placing the plants in a dark place \u2013 a church, in Pepita\u2019s case.\n\nContained within this legend are the keys that help make some sense of time. What is time? What is a year? Is it 365 days, or twelve months or a financial-accounting period? Or is it a\n  succession of changes that surround us: frosts followed by snowdrops, primroses, bluebells, leaves on the trees, cuckoos, swallows, wildflowers, berries, fungi, turning leaves, gales and another\n  frost?\n\nOr is a year closer to this: central heating, flood warnings, flu, treacherous roads, clocks going forward, Easter eggs, the football season ending, a beach holiday, the football season starting\n  again, clocks going back, kids playing conkers (in magazines but nowhere else), time to buy a new coat, Christmas?\n\nThe way we view a year is a good measure of our connection with nature, because a failure to notice dramatic change is symptomatic of a relationship that is on weak ground. Think of the person\n  who goes on a health drive, loses a stone, changes their hairstyle, gets a spray-on tan one morning and buys a whole new wardrobe that afternoon. If this scale of change goes unnoticed by their\n  other half, this is a relationship that may be in some peril.\n\nOne annoying mistake that a lot of nature enthusiasts make is to cajole people to appreciate the changing seasons. What a waste of everybody\u2019s time that sort of sentiment is. Yes,\n  nature\u2019s seasonal displays are the greatest shows on earth, but we can only come to love and understand them by getting to know the minor characters. Trying to take in the whole show in one\n  go is the sort of challenge that God might find entertaining, but even He would probably feel the need for a sit down with a cup of tea and a biscuit afterwards.\n\nAs we saw in the previous chapters, we can start to make sense of the vast canvas around us by moving from the big relationships, the broad brushstrokes of habitat-knowledge, to the finer\n  connections, the species within those habitats. This narrowing from broad to fine focus is what allows us to make sense of our natural surroundings in the moment. This approach helps us to make\n  decisions about the aspects of the nature matrix that we find most intriguing. The area we end up taking most interest in comes down to a personal decision \u2013 birds are no better than bees,\n  bass or buddleias \u2013 but once made, it is this interest in a particular area that allows us to begin to unravel the melees of change that are the seasons.\n\nEvery meaningful gauge of time will find its roots in the daily revolution of the earth, the annual orbit of the earth around the sun and the regular changes in weather, plant\n  and animal life patterns that follow as a consequence. While nobody is oblivious to the broadest changes in their environment \u2013 those that occur between summer and winter \u2013 almost\n  everybody has lost contact with the subtler patterns of change that surround us. It does not matter whether we look at the habits of the sun, the night sky or the smallest of plants, we can\n  rediscover lost calendars.\n\nSky Calendars\n\nNecessity led our ancestors to a very practical relationship with the stars. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and the ancient Egyptians used its appearance to\n  predict the annual flood of the Nile. Early cultures across the world found their patterns of life tied to what they saw above them: aboriginal Australians traditionally began cultivation when the\n  Pleiades, or the \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019, appeared.\n\nIf we are keen to regain this lost connection with time in the night sky, then language can help. Sometimes the clues in the names of shapes in the sky are obvious, like the Summer and Winter\n  Triangles; sometimes they require a little more thought and cultural immersion. Virgo is usually depicted holding an ear of corn, symbolizing summer. Aries is the ram, ancient symbol of fertility\n  and hence a spring constellation.\n\nNatural navigators have to learn quickly that the sun rises and sets in a slightly different place each day and this direction varies massively over the course of a year. In midwinter in the UK,\n  the sun rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest, but in midsummer the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. When it comes to sunrise and sunset, time and direction are two\n  sides of the same coin; if you know one then you can deduce the other. The ancients approached this relationship from the opposite side to the navigator. If you wish to learn how to use the sun as\n  a calendar, then it is a good idea to emulate the ancients in their approach.\n\nIf you mark the point where the sun rises over the course of a year using stones viewed from a fixed point, then you have a calendar. We can find these calendars still standing, both in places\n  with names that are familiar, like Stonehenge, and in less familiar locations spread across the Bronze Age landscape. If you can see either sunrise or sunset from the same place over the course of\n  half a year or more, then this is something it is well worth trying yourself. There is no need to haul giant stones to the summit of a hill; marks on a windowsill can create the same effect, and an\n  equally accurate calendar.\n\nThe Ring of Brodgar at sunset, Orkney, Scotland. Any structures that line up with the sunrise or sunset like this, however modest, create a calendar.\n\nGround Time\n\nEven the shortest walk can be a tour of wondrous natural calendars, clocks and thermometers. Most plants stop growing below about 6\u00b0c, but each plant and animal will\n  respond to light and temperature in a unique way, which can be read with practice.\n\nAt its simplest level this process begins with the realization that there are windows of opportunity whatever our interests are. Flowers, fish, fungi and fowl will make it quite clear to us\n  early on that they have a calendar and a schedule. Part of becoming a nature-lover is a reconciling of diaries. Sometimes this can be done casually \u2013 we look out for the first swallows each\n  year in a laid-back way \u2013 but occasionally, a more formal arrangement is needed. The reindeer in Lapland begin their summer migration with an eerie punctiliousness: they set off on 29 July\n  each year.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a scientist on earth who could possibly offer insight into even 10 per cent of the natural global change that takes place during the course of one year, and yet every single\n  person who develops a connection with nature will be able to relate some of the annual narrative within their area of interest. And these stories will get more detailed with each passing year.\n\nIf, for example, we develop an interest in trees, this will inevitably start with an awareness of the most dramatic patterns: spring leaf growth and autumnal shedding. Before long, curiosity\n  will have revealed that plants are sensitive to the length of night, and that it is this that gives them an \u2018awareness\u2019 of season. (Commercial strawberry growers like to put the light\n  on in the middle of the night; five minutes is all it takes to turn one long night into two short ones for the plants. Winter becomes summer at the flick of a switch.)\n\nDuring the following year of tree-watching, the golds and reds of falling leaves may reveal yet more interest behind the beauty, because we have learned that the trees use this time to filter\n  out toxins, and that any poisonous metals that they have drawn up from the soil during the course of the previous year will be urgently ushered into these falling leaves and sent on their way. The\n  golden leaves take on a fresh metallic sheen in our minds.\n\nMy passion for natural navigation means that I have become well versed in the dark and light arts that are phototropism, gravitropism and thigmomorphogenesis (the way plants grow in response to\n  light, gravity and touch respectively). I love using trees as a compass, and this practical curiosity led quickly to a more academic curiosity, because the only way I could answer the questions I\n  had was to learn about the way trees respond to sunlight, gravity, wind and time. (You know you\u2019ve got the nature bug pretty bad when you\u2019re spending evenings reading academic research\n  papers about the weight of tree roots in another country . . . for fun.) This has in turn led me to understand many annual changes in trees, allowing me to connect with time in a deeper and more\n  intriguing way each time I take a walk. At its simplest level, I notice things like the way you can estimate the age of a young conifer tree by counting the number of lateral branch whorls. At a\n  deeper level, I recognize late autumn as the time when I can first read direction from the shape of tree branches at a distance. (Tree branches on the southern side are more horizontal than the\n  northern side, because of phototropism.)\n\nSimilarly, an interest in birds will lead to an awareness of the way sensors in a bird\u2019s brain respond to varying light levels and times. The migratory habits of birds stimulate our\n  interest in seasonal change like nothing else. They come and they go. And in that sentence lie joys and mysteries that have filled a thousand books or more.\n\nHow old is this conifer? The levels of branch whorls reveal all.\n\nAnglers will take great pleasure in knowing the seasonal habits of trout or salmon in a way that might surprise the fish themselves, should a frank discussion between the two camps ever take\n  place.\n\nEach autumn, red admiral butterflies depart our shores for the second-home, sherry-steeped brochure-land of Andalucia in Spain. Here they lay their eggs and die. No species is immune to the\n  rhythms beat out by the sun. We certainly aren\u2019t: have you ever tried driving to Cornwall at the start of the summer holidays?\n\nThe Rebels\n\nSpecies that rebel against seasonal norms are loved for their courage. The mistle thrush that can be heard to sing when all other birds have turned shy, even during winter\n  gales, earns our respect, and his nickname, \u2018stormcock\u2019, comes alive on the wind. The red berries and dark-green leaves of holly have found their way onto Christmas cards and earned a\n  little fondness, despite their prickles, because they refuse to let their colours be bowed by a decrease in daylight or a blanket of snow. Gorse will flower at any time of year, and our love of\n  this resilience can be found in the old saying, \u2018Gorse is out of bloom when kissing\u2019s out of fashion\u2019.\n\nIf we love the natural rebels, then there are some very mixed feelings about species that have been made to rebel artificially. People might feel differently about the availability of tomatoes\n  in winter if they knew that their ripeness has been achieved by the introduction of cold-resistant genes taken from fish.\n\nIt is not only the plants and animals that can rebel. We can, too, by doing things that gently shock the senses. A cold winter night walk can reset the senses and introduce new joys to a\n  landscape that we thought we knew too well.\n\nThe things that mark time for us can reveal our interests and, since our interests go some way to defining us, we can learn a lot about a person by asking the question,\n  \u2018What does spring mean to you?\u2019\n\nTry it on someone if you don\u2019t believe me. When they ask what you mean by your question, do not be deterred. Lean forward and repeat your question, speaking clearly and slowly. Now smile\n  and whisper in their ear, \u2018Spring has come when you can cover seven daisies with one foot.\u2019\n\nAnd then do a traditional spring fertility dance. This is all essential.\n\nSpring has come when your foot can cover seven daisies.",

Fast Change\n\n\u2018How can that nasty little machine possibly know what the great golden Sun is up to?\u2019\n\n(OSCAR WILDE)\n\nThe writer Jay Griffiths spent six months living with the Karen tribe in Northern Thailand. She was the only one wearing a watch, but bizarrely, she felt she was the only one\n  who could never really tell what the time was. The Karen were sensitive to the shifts in light, temperature and sound, and this gave them a more fundamental understanding of time than a watch\n  could: \u2018the forest over the course of a day supplied a symphony of time, provided you knew the score.\u2019\n\nThis is a beautiful idea, but knowing the score is a bigger challenge than those three words might suggest. I would guess that the Karen themselves don\u2019t know the\n  \u2018score\u2019. They have most likely amassed enough experience for their understanding of time to lie deeper in their minds than \u2018knowledge\u2019, which sits closer to the surface.\n  This is a concept that I encounter regularly in navigation: if, from memory, you try to make a list of all the twists and turns you take on a regular long journey, you will almost certainly miss\n  one or two. And yet if you undertake the journey, you do not get lost. Our experience and understanding of many aspects of our surroundings is contextual. This book has the words\n  \u2018How to\u2019 at the start of the title, so it is my job to try to shortcut this process of long-term accumulation of experience. Advice like \u2018go native for five years\u2019 would be\n  a lazy and unhelpful solution to this problem. How can we learn to appreciate time like the Karen without turning our lives upside down? Fortunately some practical techniques are available.\n\nIn my natural navigation courses I try to make sure that everyone leaves with one question added to their daily routine: \u2018Which way am I looking?\u2019 Answering this question using\n  nature alone will take you on a mental adventure. Time and navigation are very closely related, and my other favourite question is: \u2018What time is it?\u2019 If you attempt to answer these two\n  questions as accurately as possible without using any man-made devices, you will find yourself on a journey, one that takes you from the plants by your feet out into the solar system and beyond.\n  The key is to ask yourself those questions. The value lies not in the accuracy of your answers, but in the attempt you make to reach them.\n\nWe are all familiar with loose natural time concepts like the well-worn \u2018dawn chorus\u2019 of the birds, but birders develop a way of tuning into this clock more\n  finely. They note the skylark that stops at dusk and starts at dawn, and the progression of early risers that pre-empt even the more famous alarm call of the cockerel.\n\nToday we may develop natural time-telling skills out of desire, but the roots of it lie in practical necessity. The dairy farmers that get up at five every morning do not do it out of a\n  masochistic love of the Shipping Forecast. Their wellingtons tread in the footsteps of ancient, universal traditions. From Rajasthan to Central Africa, pastoral people see time through the rhythms\n  of their animals: the Konso of Central Africa describe the period we know as 5\u20136 p.m. as kakalseema \u2013 \u2018when the cattle return home\u2019. But what are the cattle tuned\n  into? It is not the atomic clock in Teddington, which counts 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a caesium atom before declaring a second to have passed. The Konso and the cattle\u2019s clock is the\n  sun.\n\nEvery clock, watch, calendar and diary ever invented by humans does a simple job imperfectly. They each track the earth\u2019s daily revolution and its orbit around the sun. They are all wrong\n  most of the time. Midday on a watch is rarely midday. Midday is the middle of the day, the moment that the sun is highest in the sky, not twelve o\u2019clock on a watch. Timepieces can track time\n  and some do a better job than others, but they don\u2019t create, define or discover it. Dava Sobel put it well: \u2018A clock or watch may keep time, but only a sundial can find\n  time.\u2019\n\nA watch that disagrees strongly with the sun becomes worthless. The most powerful people on earth will look like fools if they declare it morning before the sun has given permission. For time to\n  have any objective meaning, we must look to the sky. Time is measured by our relationship with the sky, but the word \u2018our\u2019 is important. It is not just how we relate to the sky as\n  individuals or even as a species: in this instance, \u2018our\u2019 refers to all living things. Animals each follow their own daily rhythm, and plants such as Arctic poppies, snow buttercups and\n  many others turn to face towards the sun over the course of each day.\n\nThe stars, animals, flowers and sun beat out time with varying degrees of meticulousness. There are also many time clues that are less exact. In many mountainous tropical parts of the world,\n  moist maritime air reaches the hills at midday every day, obscuring the summits in cloud. Or is it ten to twelve? Domestic flights in Sarawak, Borneo are scheduled in the mornings to beat the\n  dependable afternoon fogs. Fog-, flower- and star-clocks tick around the world.\n\nEven a nature neophyte will be able to tell summer from winter, by assessing the temperature and looking at tree leaves. A nature enthusiast will be able to tell which month it is by observing\n  the birds or the flowers. And a nature zealot may be able to tell the time of day from the opening and closing of a daisy (so named because its petals open and close at dawn and dusk, forming a\n  \u2018day\u2019s eye\u2019). But the most important thing, however deep your commitment, is to try to make a true connection with nature. A sensitivity to the way we can read time in nature\n  leads to an understanding that no two moments are ever repeated. We never see, smell, hear, feel or taste the same thing in exactly the same way twice. This is true in any context, but the\n  importance of it is overlooked by most people outdoors.\n\nMost of us would appreciate that a journey on the Indian Pacific Railway or to see Persepolis would represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Far fewer recognize that the sight of, for\n  example, a crow flying over a field will never be repeated exactly. There are too many variables. Even if the same crow flew in exactly the same way, the sky, light, colours, plants, scents,\n  temperature and sounds we experienced would all be different. Each time we notice anything outdoors it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We have truly learned to read time when we have discovered\n  that nature itself allows us to distinguish each moment from those that come before and after it.\n\nBefore Charles I was executed in 1649, his parting gift to his son was the silver sundial he carried with him. For the king, a lump of silver this size was not a significant part of his estate,\n  but the message he meant to pass with it might have been.",

      "content": "# 1. The Clocks Within\n\n\u2018I was out early before breakfast this morning bathing from the sands. There was a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked\n      to the sea, where the waves were curling white with foam and the red morning sunshine glowed upon the naked limbs of the bathers.\u2019\n\n(FRANCIS KILVERT,1872)\n\nWe have looked at some of the practical ways of immersing ourselves in nature, but so far we have managed to keep ourselves \u2013 the subject of this book \u2013 largely\n  away from the lower end of the microscope. No longer.\n\nPhysiology students at Imperial College London are taught about circadian rhythms with the help of a rectal thermometer. By measuring their own temperatures over the course of a day, the\n  students learn that our body temperature follows a cycle. From a trough very early in the morning, at about 5 a.m., it rises to a peak about twelve hours later. There is typically a variation\n  between peaks and troughs of 1\u00b0c, and although that may not sound massive on first reading, bear in mind that a rise of 1\u00b0c is a symptom of influenza.\n\nA fluctuation in body temperature is one of the few straightforward indicators that scientists have been able to use to monitor the roller-coaster of wakefulness and sleepiness that we all\n  experience every day. One thing we all know from our own experience, and which science has confirmed, is that we do not all get on the same ride. Each of us experiences different peaks and troughs\n  of wakefulness each day.\n\nBy the time the animal kingdom and plant kingdoms divorced, early in the evolution of life on earth, the genes that enable a sensitivity to the daily cycle of light and dark were already\n  established. They can be found in human DNA, and we share them with other animals and most basic plants to this day. Each time we see the sun set, changes are triggered within us and every living\n  thing around us.\n\nSleepiness and wakefulness are parts of the physiological ride, but they are not the only things that fluctuate throughout the day. Our individual alertness, mood and energy levels will be\n  influenced by blood sugar, insulin response, allergies, exercise, smells, colours and temperature \u2013 and that is before we consider any of the stimulants or sedatives, like caffeine or\n  alcohol, we tend to lob into the system for good measure. In short, the way we feel, and therefore our experience of our surroundings, is shaped by the nature within us.\n\nWe are subject to hormonal tides, ones that rise and fall daily, monthly and yearly. Women pick up pheromone cues from other women in their perspiration, and it is this that leads to a\n  synchronization of menstrual cycles in women who live together. With the variations of the hormone cycle, the individual\u2019s sense of alertness, wellbeing and mood also changes. There are many\n  women who will assert that a flower does not look equally beautiful at all times of the month. But men will also be fighting upheavals, not least in tidal surges of testosterone. A man who is\n  trying to admire a wildflower with a woman he finds very attractive may have to focus more consciously than the woman. And they might both find a wildflower hard to appreciate at 10 p.m., even\n  under torchlight, as this is the most common time for lovemaking \u2013 a consequence of circadian rhythms leading to a particular cultural convention.\n\nWe are only keeping step with the rest of the animal kingdom in these habits. Black cats are not lucky between March and May, because this is when mature toms go for a wander in search of a mate\n  and are most likely to be killed crossing a road. Hedgehog road-deaths also peak at this time, with male deaths outnumbering females by a ratio of 2 to 1. Most animals mate at the time of year\n  (indicated by day length) that will lead to birth at a time when food is most prevalent. So the male human testosterone level peaks in October, and the fact foragers are busy in late summer is\n  related \u2013 nature has ensured that more babies are born in the late summer months when there is more food around.\n\nBoth the man and the woman will find the same species of flower appears subtly different with each passing year, as age shapes us, both through the accumulation of experiences and the natural\n  ageing process. It becomes harder to smell the flower after middle age, and harder to hear the birds around it. Ageing is not all downhill, however, and the Owl of Minerva comes late: wisdom, that\n  hard-to-define quality, gives us an ability to appreciate smaller things with time. The half-scent of a rose may offer a richer experience to an eighty-year-old than the full scent would to a\n  twenty-year-old.\n\nPsychological cycles ride on top of our physiological ones. Our financial or emotional security will influence our experience of the world, and this is true regardless of our situation. The\n  wealthiest person in the world can still hate the world, while the Weyemba people of Sumba in Indonesia feel that their own economic progress has impacted on astronomy: \u2018the moon rises\n  differently and the sun sets differently now\u2019, they believe.\n\nExercise 14\n\nImagine a scene: you are looking from halfway up a hill, across a valley, with sunlight reflecting off a meandering river. There are cattle in the fields, and patches of\n      mixed woodland breaking up the pasture. A pink rock stands at the corner of one field. Add a few elements of your own, allow your imagination to fill some blanks. Now hold onto that view.\n\nYou are feeling triumphant from a successful walk, and your walking companion has just suggested something that promises an interesting afternoon and possibly evening. You are alert, it is\n      mid-morning, the coffee at breakfast was good and the breakfast was better. You slept well on sheets that had surely been ironed, and you\u2019re looking forward to another four days of\n      similar pleasures, during this short walking holiday. Take in the view before you. Pick out each detail. Use the sun to work out the time and the direction you are looking in.\n\nUnfortunately the evening did not go at all as you had hoped. You find yourself walking back up the hill the following morning, alone and on an empty stomach. You need to wash away a\n      sleepless night with fresh air, but you must hurry as you need to head back home much sooner than expected because of serious problems at work. You feel the first annoying heat in your nostrils\n      of a cold coming on. Your muscles are stiff from the day before and one calf muscle feels torn. You reach the same spot and pause. Take in the view before you. How little could you care for the\n      detail? Turn away from the sun and its irritating cheer.",

He to whom this emotion is a stranger . . . is as good\n      as dead.\u2019\n\n(ALBERT EINSTEIN)\n\nSo far, we have taken the following steps to reconnect with nature:\n\n1. Applied new skills to the natural world, and tried doing new things.\n\n2. Flexed our senses and given them a workout.\n\n3. Grown comfortable with landscapes, habitats and the broadest of nature\u2019s brushstrokes.\n\n4. Investigated a few of the finer connections to be found.\n\n5. Allowed ourselves to be allured by conflict.\n\n6. Appreciated the role of time in nature, and that we will never get a chance to witness anything in exactly the same way twice.\n\n7. Stepped into the landscape and made ourselves part of the nature experience.\n\nIf we do not take the simple steps above, we are gambling a lot on there being another life like this one; if, on the other hand, we do take these steps, then a series of\n  positive consequences follows. Changes occur in how we perceive things, how we think, how we feel and how we act. At this point, the subject becomes a willing object. Nature begins to change us.\n  This positive change encourages us to invest more in the process. The cycle strengthens.\n\nGrowing numbers of studies are revealing simple correlations between our exposure to nature, or lack of it, and our wellbeing. Research in the US has shown that the more green\n  spaces in a neighbourhood, the lower the average body mass index of the children who live there.\n\nMany of the health impacts are less well understood, but this is changing. Patients recovering from surgery have been found to need one day less in hospital if trees can be seen from their\n  window instead of just bricks. If pharmaceutical companies could put this effect in a pill, they would do so and they would make billions. But they can\u2019t. Nature can\u2019t be packaged or\n  marketed easily; we cannot rely on others to sell us a solution.\n\nA recent study has shown that people become more generous after they have seen pictures of nature. Academics like to measure generosity with a basic experimental test called the \u2018dictator\n  game\u2019. It is very simple: person A is given a sum of money and asked if they would like to give any of it to person B. Studies have shown that if people are being watched, they become more\n  generous, because that is how they wish to be perceived. This effect can even be achieved by putting an image of a pair of eyes on a wall. Amazingly, a picture of flowers has recently been shown to\n  have an even greater impact on human generosity in these experiments than a pair of eyes.\n\nTime spent in nature has been shown to improve self-esteem and conflict resolution. It also reduces absenteeism, and one hour spent in nature can improve memory and attention span by 20 per\n  cent. Nature can calm us, it can help us focus and, for many, it works as an antidepressant. The author Richard Louv has made a convincing case for the power of time spent in nature to improve our\n  relationships with family and friends. Just as families can bond over mutual interests in sport or work, nature can become a shared interest \u2013 but it has a particular advantage when it comes\n  to forming bonds: time spent in nature takes us away from impatient and interrupting technology.\n\nBoth technology and nature have an allure, and we can find ourselves mesmerized by either. This means that we sometimes have to tug ourselves from one to the other, but once we make the shift\n  there is little or no sense of loss. When we\u2019re indoors, such mind-neutral activities as watching TV or checking social media can feel more enticing than putting on a coat and stepping\n  outside. However, after ten minutes in the fresh air these electronic mind-traps lose any magnetism they may once have held.\n\nInstead of castigating computer games as all bad, we might do better to accept that they obviously appeal very strongly to many people, especially the young, and look for lessons within that.\n  One cool sunny October morning following a day of heavy rain, I knew it was a prime time for admiring autumnal fungi in our local woods, and I was very keen to share this with my young sons. They\n  seemed distracted by a computer game at the time, so I decided to fight fire with fire by appealing to their sense of competition and scores. I told them that the record for the greatest number of\n  fungus specimens I\u2019d ever found in one walk was fourteen. We returned two hours later with big grins and a new top score. The boys ran up to their mum and proudly declared that they had found\n  114 fungi, 100 more than Dad could find on his own. For me that morning also set a different top score: it was among my top ten life experiences to date.\n\nAside from the relatively easy-to-identify physiological and philosophical benefits, a connection with nature offers something bigger and more mysterious. When we stop to look at something and\n  trace the connection between that organism and ourselves, we invest time in a form of contemplation.\n\nYou are walking on limestone hills and you stop to retie your shoelaces. A blister on one foot is rubbing against the sock. You notice beside your foot a plant called a prickly lettuce, and\n  struggle, for fun, to remember the things you have read about it. And then its Latin name comes back to you, Lactuca serriola, because this is the plant with serrated edges, which lactates\n  a milky sap if broken. You pause.\n\nThe prickly lettuce is absorbing the morning sun. Your eyes are drawn to the sun and it tinkers with your body-clock, making you feel more awake and energetic. The lettuce is thriving in the\n  soil above the limestone. You are thriving by walking on the limestone hills. In a month the flower will be gone; soon you will have left that spot. When you return, the flower may not be there;\n  even if it is, all will be different. The light, colours, scents and temperature will be different. Your feelings, levels of alertness and energy, thoughts, mood and memories will be different. The\n  earth will have revolved a few more times.\n\nThere will come a time when the earth continues to turn, the sun rises once more over the limestone hills, but there is no prickly lettuce and there is no you. What little there was of you\n  \u2013 beyond a collection of carbon-based chemicals \u2013 are the things you have sensed and your reactions to them. And so you stop and look at the lettuce. You glance once more at its leaves\n  and then at the sun. And then you let the lettuce ask you some questions.\n\n\u2018Which direction are you looking in, and what time is it?\u2019\n\nIn taking the time to answer these questions you realize that the search takes you to the horizon and then beyond to the earth revolving and orbiting at 19 miles per second. The questions bring\n  you back to the plant, it whispers a suggestion to look at its fellow prickly lettuces. They are all aligned. The prickly lettuce, you remember, has leaves that align north\u2013south. It is\n  flowering, which means it is late summer, and this means the sun has risen north of east. Whilst you are thinking about this, a sundial appears on the dry soil, as the leaves cast a shadow. The sun\n  and flowers give you the understanding that you are looking south on a late summer morning, and invest that understanding with a meaningfulness that would be entirely absent if you were using a\n  watch and compass. A weak sense of connection with time and place begins to form. You feel a surprising joy at this reaction, which fuels a slightly greater curiosity.\n\nThen, to your shock, the lettuce whispers two new questions:\n\n\u2018How are you and who are you?\u2019\n\nYou pause, unsure how to answer. Then the plant suggests that the answer to the question will be found in how you perceive your surroundings and how you react to them.\n\nThe more we perceive, the greater our chances of discovering something that triggers a reaction. The more connections we notice between the nature we observe, our surroundings\n  and ourselves, the profounder these reactions become. There is a strong correlation between the number of profound reactions we have to the things we notice in life, and the richness of life.\n\nIf someone or something surprises, delights, amazes or confounds you, then that is an encounter you will remember. The prickly lettuce, for instance, may be shy at first, but it will do all of\n  these things, if you are curious enough. The harder it is to form a connection with a part of nature, the greater the reward we receive when we finally make that connection.\n\nIf our life is made up of perceptions and reactions, then the way we notice and react to a plant or animal helps define who we are. There is nothing original in making a billion dollars or\n  ruling a nation; both have been done a thousand times before by others. The chances are that nobody has ever taken the time to solve the puzzle of how one particular straggly specimen of wild\n  lettuce connects to them as an individual. This unusual line of enquiry will inevitably lead to changes in thought patterns, which will lead to noticing new things, which will subtly alter the way\n  we think and then behave. The result will be originality.\n\nThere is a humility that comes with an interest in nature. If it does nothing else, nature can simultaneously excite us by hinting at what we can discover and humble us with our own ignorance.\n  With each passing year this sensation grows. It would be hard to find a record of a person whose deathbed regret was taking too great an interest in their surroundings, although the opposite\n  \u2013 regret for failing to fully engage with the world \u2013 is widespread and takes many forms.\n\nA combination of humility and aspiration is a trait found in the most interesting of people. Those who choose to reside purely in the practical or philosophical world tend to scorn the land that\n  lies between these two areas, the natural world. But those rare individuals who do things that change the way we think, or think in a way that changes how we behave, have, without exception,\n  understood the insight that a connection with nature can offer.\n\nInvestigate any individual who has achieved extraordinary things and a fascination with nature will be found. They will have sought to understand the way the things that fascinate them fit into\n  the broader network. The biggest and boldest ideas are still rooted alongside the plants and animals if we look hard enough. Einstein is best known for his mastery of the mathematical equations\n  that help describe the fundamental physics of the universe, but it should not surprise us that he liked to walk in the Princeton woods each day.\n\nWe are all likely to feel a calling at some time in our lives to do something that transcends the ordinary, that goes beyond eating, drinking, reproducing and not shivering. It does not matter\n  what lies at the top of our pyramid, whether it is creative, productive, cerebral, emotional or chaotic . . . Time spent considering nature will help. This is partly because a profound\n  contemplation of anything has been proven to help us psychologically, whether it is labelled meditation, prayer or om-shan-ti-ing. An appreciation of nature\n  enhances both a sense of humility and a fascination with the most ordinary of things. The words of Seneca call out to us from a different millennium: \u2018It is characteristic of a great soul to\n  scorn great things and prefer what is ordinary.\u2019\n\nSeneca is not alone in believing that people who find things interesting tend to be more interesting people.\n\nReconnecting with nature is not something that should be done. It is not something that we do because it is good in itself, or even because it is good for our health. It is a\n  way of finding life more interesting, becoming a more interesting person and then achieving more interesting things.\n\nTime spent considering a prickly lettuce might well help us to achieve the things that we currently consider more important than a lettuce. As you consider this, your mind may be dragged away by\n  a practical need, a hunger that takes you somewhere else. Hunger will take you to the first steps of Maslow\u2019s pyramid. What will happen if you bend down and pick some young leaves from the\n  prickly lettuce to eat?\n\nYour first reaction will be that the leaves taste quite bitter, but not wholly unpleasant. If your hunger drives you on to eat more, you may suddenly notice that the pain from your blister has\n  evaporated and you have begun to feel relaxed and even a little sleepy. The plant contains lactucarium, which is a mild sedative and painkiller and has been used as an alternative to opium. As you\n  lie down in your weak opiate daze, it occurs to you that this weed that few would notice has been your compass, your calendar, your clock, your grocer, your etymological teaser, your pharmacist and\n  now your quiet companion.\n\nWe are what we eat, but nature offers us more than just food for our stomachs. It feeds us thoughts and ideas that help take us wherever we want to go. Nature suggests fascinating new paths for\n  each of us \u2013 sometimes after a good sleep in the sun.",

They had not ceased this afternoon when I walked into the wood and got into bright, miraculous\n      sunshine, in shelter from the roaring wind.\u2019\n\n(RALPH WALDO EMERSON)\n\nAnyone who follows the steps set out in this book will begin to reconnect with nature. This will lead to experiences that surprise and delight in small and then bigger ways.\n  These experiences feed a desire to invest more in the process. New skills are learned, new knowledge gained, senses are heightened, awareness grows, new connections are discovered and experiences\n  become more profound. The cycle strengthens further.\n\nEnriching our experience of the outdoors will make us appreciate how unaware most of us are, most of the time. This is both worrying and exciting, and leads to a parting between the connected\n  person and the disconnected. To the aware, there is no point in occupying a middle ground, as it merely offers a weaker, less satisfying version of what is available. The gulf grows as the aware\n  person takes more delight in the process, and their sense of connection flourishes.\n\nIt does not take long before it is possible to look back at your former self \u2013 the person who did not connect with nature \u2013 and find a strange creature you barely recognize. Instead\n  of pitying this poor mole, one that has never taken the time to sniff above the ground, you will want to encourage others to explore, to poke their snouts into the air and not to fear the million\n  scents they find there.\n\nA Final Exercise\n\nOnce you have read this book and tried the exercises, return to a spot you knew before reading the book. Ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. What time is it?\n\n2. What direction am I looking?\n\nUse nature to answer these questions. Then ask yourself two more:\n\n3. Is this place the same place I stood in before?\n\n4. Am I the same person who was here earlier?\n\nThere are no right answers to questions three and four, and it is the process of trying to reach an answer of any kind that is of value. Even if there were correct answers,\n      they would have changed by the time you arrived at them.\n\nA Final Thought\n\nIt should be expected that we will find wonder in a vast mountain landscape, but it is a more serious challenge to find wonder in a hill. It is a great achievement to find it\n  in a molehill.",

      "content": "## Introduction\n\nSome of what may be subtly yet importantly wrong with our lives can be traced back to the lack of a quality that could sound a little na\u00efve or even unserious, but that is critically important to our flourishing: excitement.\n\nWhen we lack excitement, it isn\u2019t that things are terrible: we may have work, friends, family and some options. It is just that, in a multitude of areas, life lacks flavour. Things feel repetitive, routine and devoid of intensity, as though we are merely going through the motions; as though we are there but are not properly present. Not much profoundly satisfies us; we fulfil obligations, we are dutiful and responsible, yet our deep selves are unquenched. Without meaning anything melodramatic by this, we are in a sort of cage. Or, to use another metaphor, we\u2019re crouching; our limbs aren\u2019t free. We are drained by varieties of shyness, numbness and inhibition.\n\nTypically, we are invited to address the absence of excitement with outward manoeuvres: we are encouraged to travel, parachute out of aeroplanes or learn a foreign language. This is a book of psychology, however, and it holds that a lack of a sense of excitement primarily comes down to aspects of our minds \u2013 in particular, to difficulties we have first identifying and then feeling legitimate around our own desires and aspirations. Somewhere along the path of our development, we resigned ourselves too early to things that deserve to be protested against; we have felt too constricted (and perhaps unloved and unloveable) to communicate our truth to others; the proper expansion of our characters has been sacrificed for the sake of a now-stifling compliance.\n\nThis is a guide to recovering some of our spirit, and to becoming the sort of people who, thanks to a range of psychological reorientations, are connected to the intensity, beauty and mystery of life and to the richness of their own possibilities. The English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott (1896\u20131971) once remarked that what mattered less than whether someone was happy or not was whether they felt as if they were leading their own lives. This suggests how often we fall into leading the lives that other people (some of them well-meaning) want us to lead, adjusting ourselves to their needs more than is wise and bowing to socially sanctioned but incomplete ideas of what is \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nThis is a book about freedom. We know the word in its political context, but it exists, and achieves its full resonance and majesty, in a psychological form. An exciting life of freedom is different from a merely good or wise or calm life: it is one that can feature novelty, tension, eros, ambition and appreciation. It encompasses a capacity to take risks, to trust and to know how to communicate one\u2019s perspective to others. It means allowing oneself to be a little more forthright, joyful, irreverent and unfrightened. This is a book for people who, although living, are only intermittently liberated enough to feel alive, but who are now ready to make meaningful changes.",

We strive not to admit to what we really do like: staying in; eating strange things in a disgusting way alone in the kitchen late at night; plotting revenge; seeing no one; wasting time; buying gadgets; and looking up the fate of ex-lovers and colleagues from long ago.\n\nIn the process, without meaning to, we perpetuate a world in which everyone else has to lie along with us. Because everyone refrains from uttering their truths, the price of breaking cover remains impossibly high. We collude in a mass conspiracy to suggest that love, sex, work, family life, friends and holidays unfold in a way we know in our hearts they simply don\u2019t. We remain at the dawn of any collective capacity to acknowledge what fundamental parts of life are actually like.\n\nA lack of love holds us back. We are emotional liars because, somewhere during our upbringing, we failed to imbibe a robust sense that we might be acceptable in and of our essence. No one said with enough conviction that we were allowed just to be. We were given convincing lessons in how not to speak our more dangerous thoughts clearly. We became experts at complying. We came to associate being good and normal with being someone else.\n\nHow much more interesting it might be if we dared to be a little braver, and conceived of many encounters as opportunities to risk the sharing of new truths. We might realise that our picture of what might happen if we are honest derives from outdated or irrelevant contexts: childhood, the company of narrow-minded schoolmates, obvious bullies, social media \u2026 Learning not to lie would not only be of egoistic benefit; our vulnerability would invite, and rehabilitate, that of others. Every confession we could muster would allow our companions to let go of a part of their own loneliness. Every move towards greater honesty would edge us towards a less needlessly isolated and painfully shame-filled world.",

      "content": "### Leaning into vulnerability\n\nFor many of us, whenever we feel scared, sad, anxious or lonely, the last thing we would think of doing is sharing our distress; a confession threatens to make an already difficult situation untenable. We assume that our best chance of defending ourselves and recovering our self-possession is to say nothing. When we are sad at a gathering of friends, we smile. When we are terrified before a speech, we try to change the subject. When we\u2019re asked how we\u2019re coping, we say, \u2018Very well indeed, thank you.\u2019 We aren\u2019t deliberately out to deceive; we are practising the only manoeuvre we know and trust in response to our vulnerability.\n\nWhat we fear above all is judgement. We are social creatures who have come to equate being accepted with appearing poised. We assume that we could not explain what is really going on inside us and survive unblemished. In our eyes, the price of safety is the maintenance of a permanent semblance of composure.\n\nHowever, there might be an alternative to this punishing and isolating philosophy: rather than insisting on our well-being at moments of fear, sadness, anxiety and loneliness, we might actually reveal that things aren\u2019t perfect for us; that we\u2019re pretty scared right now; that we\u2019re finding it hard to talk to people or maintain faith in the future; that we feel anxious and in need of company.\n\nAlthough we might be alarmed at the prospect of divulging such sentiments, it might help us arrive at some surprising discoveries. We might immediately feel lighter and less oppressed; our connection with those around us might become significantly deeper by sharing more of the turmoil of our inner lives; and, most unexpectedly of all, the revelation of our vulnerability could make us appear stronger rather than weaker in the eyes of others.\n\nSome of our regrettable furtiveness comes from imagining that all disclosures of fear, sadness, anxiety and loneliness must be the same. But this is to ignore a critical difference between a revelation that comes across as an insistent, desperate demand for rescue, and one that frames a problem with an attitude of sober, sad dignity. There is a distinction between begging never to be left alone again and revealing that one has been finding one\u2019s evenings a bit quiet of late. There can be a firm and dependable barrier between neediness and vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, rather than merely not threatening our dignity, revelation may be the very ingredient that enhances it. However impressive it may superficially be never to show weakness, it is much more impressive to have the courage, psychological insight and self-discipline to talk about one\u2019s weaknesses in a boundaried and contained way. It is the mark of a real adult to be able to disclose, with a mixture of aplomb and tact, aspects of one\u2019s childlike self: that one has been going through a dreadful time; that one really doesn\u2019t want to be here; or that one is very worried about seeming like an idiot. True toughness isn\u2019t about maintaining a facade of military robustness, but about an artful negotiation with, and unfrightened acceptance of, one\u2019s regressive, dependent aspects.\n\nThe ability to pull this off relies on a further piece of maturity: the knowledge that everyone is, at heart, as scared, sad, lonely and anxious as we are. Even if they choose not to reveal this, we can make an empathetic leap of faith that they do so, not because they are fundamentally different and more robustly constituted than us, but because they are scared.\n\nWe are all hemmed in by an image of what it means to be a serious adult that doesn\u2019t allow us to share our vulnerable reality, and thereby makes us all sick and alienated from ourselves and from one another. We should accept that it is normal to be lonely, even though everyone is meant to have all the friends they need; that it is normal to be sick with worry, even though we\u2019re meant to have faith in the future.\n\nIn revealing our weaknesses, we are proving we are like our audiences in their true, but hitherto needlessly hidden, reality: we are somersaulting over a social barrier and generously creating a space in which others too may come to feel safe enough to show their fragility and humanity. We can lean into our fears rather than treating them as shameful enemies. Every confession, ably executed, alleviates rather than enforces our burdens. Rather than seeing the world as an entity that we must constantly impress, and our reality as something we must perpetually hide, we can dare to imagine that others would not mind us showing more of our true selves. There might be nothing more generous or impressive we could offer our neighbours than a tranquil disclosure of our feelings of sadness, isolation, worry and existential despair.",

      "content": "### Self-assertion\n\nOne of the reasons why our lives are harder than they might be is that most of us do not have a firm handle on the art of mature self-assertion; that is, the ability to put forward our interests in a way that seems credible, dignified, serene and effective. Daily we are confronted by challenges to our positions that require us to find a voice: a partner who subtly denies us affection; a colleague who malignly undermines our proposals; a parent who treads on our aspirations.\n\nIn response, we tend to behave in two equally unfortunate ways:\n\n1. We say nothing. After all, who are we to speak; why would anyone listen; how dare we? None of which stops us hating and cursing inside.\n\n2. We bottle up the toxins until they have built up a head of steam, then let rip a tirade of insults, florid accusations and sulphurous vindictiveness that, at a stroke, destroys the credibility of anything we might be trying to convey and ensures that we can be put in a box labelled \u2018tyrannical and unhinged\u2019.\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), the first systematic Western explorer of human emotions, suggested that maturity often lies midway between two extremes. His Nicomachean Ethics advances a tripartite table outlining ideal forms of behaviour, along with their two characteristically deficient or excessive departures.\n\nTo follow the model in the case of the topic at hand, we might add:\n\nAt the root of our failures lies one woefully familiar psychological problem: self-hatred. It is because we haven\u2019t learnt to love and respect ourselves that we say nothing, believing that we have no right to take our own positions seriously. Associated with this is despair at the possibility of any form of advanced intrahuman understanding. We have no experience of dialogue working out, of someone clearing their throat, apologising for being a nuisance and then calmly and eloquently articulating a point, only for their interlocutor to concede, to thank them for speaking up and to promise to look at things differently in the future. Our inner world is instead populated by shadow images of powerful tyrants who don\u2019t listen, and meek serfs with no fair right to exist. Or else, from an associated form of self-suspicion, we rush our lesson and, by making a doomed assault on the integrity of our opponent, essentially prove to ourselves that we knew it would never work out.\n\nIt can be exhausting constantly to assert oneself. In the course of a typical day, we will face many moments in which we should speak up properly: politely yet firmly, determinedly yet respectfully. It might have helped if we had received early training, as in one of those childhoods read about in psychology manuals, where a parent gently asks the upset three-year-old: \u2018Darling, how do you feel about that?\u2019 and listens to the answer, rather than telling the child to stop being so silly or attacking them for being inconsiderate after a hard day at the office.\n\nWe should see the challenge of mastering assertion as one of the great psychological hurdles. To learn how to assert oneself steadily and graciously might be ranked as a feat no less worthy of celebration (and much more useful) than climbing a mountain or making a fortune.\n\nWe should assert ourselves not because it will always work. Indeed, a bit of pessimism can be handy; when we know that people might not understand us, we no longer feel so desperate that they must. We should assert ourselves irrespective of results because it will lend us an important sense of our own agency and strength \u2013 and we\u2019ll twitch less.\n\nTo get us going, right now, we might consider where we are being gently but punishingly trodden on by those around us: people who conveniently and cleverly tell us that it\u2019s all our fault, or expect us to do the heavy lifting, or rely on us to smile and put up with their ill temper. Unusually for us, we might properly take on board that life won\u2019t go on forever, that we have a right to be here and that there is a small but fair chance of being understood.\n\nFor once, rather than saying nothing or shouting, we might wait until we are rested and feeling kind to ourselves and take up a piece of very unfamiliar Aristotelian middle ground, patiently uttering some magical words: I\u2019d love it if we might have a quick chat at some point, whenever it\u2019s convenient. There\u2019s something it would feel great to discuss \u2026",

      "content": "### What everybody really wants\n\nWe are often in situations of wanting to help and be kind to others, but of not knowing what they might need. We would like to deepen our connection to them and be of service, yet we lack a real grasp of what we could plausibly offer them. Their minds seem impenetrable; their problems opaque.\n\nAt such moments, we would do well to remember that we all possess a superpower \u2013 a capacity to give people something we can be sure they require \u2013 founded on a primordial and basic insight into human nature: everyone is in deep need of reassurance. Life is a more or less ongoing emergency for everyone. We are invariably haunted by doubts about our value, concerns for our future, shapeless anxiety and dread about things we\u2019ve done, and feelings of guilt and embarrassment about ourselves. Every day brings new threats to our integrity and, except for very rare moments when we and the world feel solid, there is almost always a background throb of unwellness in our minds. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they are old or young, accomplished or starting out, at the top of the tree or struggling to get by, we can count on one thing about anyone we meet: they will be beset by a sense of insecurity and, beneath some excellent camouflage, of desperation. Perhaps even more than they realise, they will be longing for someone to say something soothing to them; a word to make them feel that they have a right to exist; that we have faith in them; that we know things aren\u2019t always easy for them and that \u2013 in a vague but real way \u2013 we are on their side. It could be a small and barely perceptible remark, but its effect might be critical: that something fascinating they said sticks in our minds; that we know the past few months have not been easy for them; that we\u2019ve found ourselves thinking of them since our last meeting; that we\u2019ve noticed and admire the way they go about things; that they deserve a break and are, we can see, carrying so much.\n\nIt is easy to mistake reassurance for flattery. But flattery involves a lie to gain advantage, whereas reassurance involves revealing genuine affection \u2013 which we normally leave out from embarrassment \u2013 in order to bolster someone\u2019s ability to endure. We flatter in order to extract benefit; we reassure in order to help. Furthermore, the flatterer tells their prey about their strengths, whereas the reassurer does something infinitely more valuable: they hint that they have seen the weaknesses, but have only tolerance and compassion for them on the basis of sharing fully in comparable examples.\n\n\u2018I think you\u2019re going to be fine\u2019; \u2018Everyone goes through things like these\u2019; \u2018You have nothing to be ashamed of \u2026\u2019 The words we need to say to reassure aren\u2019t new \u2013 they can be the most apparently banal of sentences \u2013 but we need to keep hearing them because our minds are bad at holding on to their nourishing truths. They are, furthermore, lines that are much more valuable and inclined to stick if someone else addresses them to us than if we try to rehearse them by ourselves.\n\nIn 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio (1401\u20131428) painted a rendition of Adam and Eve\u2019s expulsion from the Garden of Eden on the walls of Florence\u2019s Church of Santa Maria del Carmine. We need not believe in any of the supernatural aspects of Genesis to be profoundly moved by the horror-stricken faces of the banished couple. If we are moved, it is because we see a version of an agony that is essentially universal \u2013 for all of us have effectively been cast out of the realm of comfort and plenty and obliged to dwell in the lands of uncertainty, humiliation and grief. All of us are beset by woes; all of us are worried to the core, longing for rest and in urgent need of forbearance and gentleness.\n\nPart of the responsibility of living in a time in which few people still believe in divine reassurance is that each of us can play a part in delivering that reassurance ourselves, to our fellow sufferers, in ordinary moments of our ordinary lives. We do not generally know the details of other people\u2019s travails, but we can often be sure of a few things: that they are at some level in a mood of pain and self-suspicion; that certain very significant things will not have gone right; that there will be loneliness, anxiety and shame at play; and that it could therefore make a big difference if we said something, however modest and unoriginal, to bring a little reassurance into their day.\n\nMasaccio, The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, c. 1425",

      "content": "### Getting expectations right\n\nIn 1905, the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848\u20131923) noticed a telling detail about the peas in his garden: 20% of the pea pods seemed to be responsible for yielding 80% of the peas. This struck Pareto because his research into economic productivity had concurrently shown him that 20% of Italians were responsible for generating 80% of the nation\u2019s wealth \u2013 a figure that later matched what he found to be true in France, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nThe surprisingly widespread applicability of this principle led to the coining of what we now know as the Pareto distribution or, more casually, the 80/20 rule. This can be observed throughout economics and business and states that 80% of effects will come from 20% of causes. For example, in a publishing house, 20% of books will generate 80% of profits; in banking, 80% of profits will come from 20% of clients, and so on.\n\nHowever salient the 80/20 rule might be in the economic (or horticultural) realm, we remain reluctant to apply it to an area where it might help us most: our personal lives. Here, too, we see a principle akin to the Pareto distribution: 80% of positive elements can be traced back to 20% of causes. Or, to put it more negatively, 80% of all inputs are likely to be partly or substantially suboptimal.\n\nThe reason why we might need to get this principle clear in our minds is that, in practical terms, we live as if the opposite is true. We assume that most of what we will meet with will be pleasant, formative, cheering and redemptive, and that we should budget for disappointment in only a small and exceptional number of cases. Then, when the opposite invariably emerges \u2013 when we encounter the frustrating and imperfect nature of existence \u2013 we howl with frustration, bitterness and surprise.\n\nTo proceed with greater statistical verve and therefore more grace, appreciation and calm, we would be wise to embed the 80/20 rule firmly in our worldview at the dawn of every new day. Some of its principles will look like this:\n\n\u2022 Most parts of every city will be ugly, dispiriting and an insult to our longing for order and optimism.\n\n\u2022 Most conversations with most people will leave us feeling misunderstood and desolate.\n\n\u2022 Most sexual opportunities will not come off.\n\n\u2022 Most projects will go wrong.\n\n\u2022 Most governments will be corrupt and unimaginative.\n\n\u2022 Most of our natural habitats will be destroyed.\n\n\u2022 Most days will be sad.\n\n\u2022 Most marriages will be intolerable.\n\n\u2022 Most glances in the mirror will be a catastrophe.\n\n\u2022 Most interactions with our children will be maddening.\n\n\u2022 Most books are terrible.\n\n\u2022 Most of life will be a waste of time.\n\nSuch is the true applicability of the Pareto principle. Far from being a recipe for gloom, heeding it will guarantee that we will not so regularly collide with one of the sharp edges of reality. Of course our work is for the most part wrong; of course our love lives are unhappy; naturally most of the sex we\u2019ve had has been regrettable; inevitably most people are a waste of our time. Demagogues, advertisers and peddlers of sentimental bromides will constantly urge us to hold out for more, or incite us to be furious that we haven\u2019t yet been given it. We should turn away from their aggravating counsel. We have not been singled out for unusual punishment; our lives are following a course that can be observed as much in the operations of a widget factory as in the fertility of plants or the profitability of nations. We need not question our relationships, our employment or our membership of the species. Most of it is no good \u2013 and that is exactly as it should be.\n\nBut this disgusting truth, once digested, only makes the rare 20% all the more worthy of reverence: those few friends who do open up properly; those occasional nights when it works out; those family members who are undefended and interesting; those days when we feel strong and purposeful. These aren\u2019t anything like the norm \u2013 nor were they ever meant to be. They are the succulent morsels of the otherwise ineluctably thin harvest we must subsist on, and therefore the parts that we must treasure and draw hope from before darkness returns.\n\nWe would be wise to embed the 80/20 rule firmly in our worldview at the dawn of every new day.",

      "content": "### Learning to be angry\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that one of the dominant problems in the world today is an excess of anger. We know all about the very shouty and their antics: their tantrums, their lack of reason, their unwillingness to compromise. Furthermore, this threatens to get a lot worse. We seem locked into a set of dynamics (political, technological, environmental) that promises an ever less patient, ever less serene and ever less forgiving future.\n\nHowever, it may be more realistic, albeit odd-sounding, to insist on the opposite: that whatever the impression generated by a publicly vocal angry cohort, the far more common problem is a widespread inability to get angry: a failure to know how to effectively mount a complaint; an inarticulate swallowing of frustration; and the bitterness, subterranean acting out and low-level depression that follow from not expressing our rightful sorrows. For every one person who shouts too loudly, there are at least twenty who have unfairly lost their voices.\n\nWe are not talking here of delirious rage \u2013 the sort that injures innocents and leads nowhere. The point is not to rehabilitate barbarism; it is to make a case for an occasional capacity to speak up, with dignity and poise, in order to correct a reasoned sense that something isn\u2019t right and that those around us need to take our opposing perspective on board.\n\nAs a rule, we are hopeless at being angry, and from the very nicest of motives. In part this stems from a belief in the complexity of situations and the minds of other people, which undercuts enthusiasm for anything that smacks of self-righteousness or pride. We tell ourselves, in relationships or at work, that others must have good reasons for behaving as they do, that they must be essentially kind and good, and that it would be an insult to their efforts to raise our hand about a problem that we surely don\u2019t understand entirely.\n\nWe tend to import our modesty from childhood. It is a privilege to allow a child to manifest their frustration \u2013 and not all parents are game. Some are keen on having a \u2018good\u2019 baby. They let the infant know that being \u2018naughty\u2019 isn\u2019t funny and that this isn\u2019t a family where children are allowed to run rings around the adults. Difficult moods and tantrums, complaints and rages are not to be part of the story. This certainly ensures short-term compliance; however, paradoxically, preternaturally good behaviour is often a precursor to bad feelings and, in extremes, mental unwellness in adulthood. Feeling loved enough that one can tell parental figures to sod off and occasionally fling something (soft) across the room belongs to health; truly mature parents have rules and allow their children (sometimes) to break them.\n\nOtherwise, there is a species of inner deadness that comes from having been forced to be too good too soon and to resign one\u2019s point of view without a flicker of self-defence. In relationships, this might mean a tendency to get taken for a ride for many years \u2013 not in terms of outright abuse (though that too), but the kind of low-level humiliation that seems the lot of people who can\u2019t make a fuss. At work, an unwavering concern for politeness, empathy and gentleness may end up providing the perfect preconditions for being walked all over.\n\nWe should try to relearn the neglected art of politely being a pain. The danger of those who have never shouted is that they might, in compensation, end up screaming. That isn\u2019t the point either. The goal is a firm but self-possessed protest: \u2018Excuse me, but you are ruining what\u2019s left of my life\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, but you are cauterising my chances of happiness\u2019; \u2018I beg your pardon, but this is enough \u2026\u2019\n\nWe think a lot about going on holiday and trying new activities. There is a lot of enthusiasm for learning other languages and attempting foreign dishes. But true exoticism and adventure may lie closer to home: in the emotional sphere, and in the courage and originality required to give contained anger a go, perhaps tonight, after supper. We have the speeches written in our heads already. There is likely to be a spouse, a parent, a colleague or a child who hasn\u2019t heard enough from us for far too long, and with whom it would be of incalculable benefit to our heart rate and our emotional and physical constitution to have a word. The timid always imagine that anger might destroy everything good. Because their childhoods encouraged them to, they overlook the fact that anger can also be a fertiliser from which something a lot less bitter and a lot more alive can emerge.",

      "content": "### Escaping the shadow of a parent\n\nWhen we think about children living under the shadow of a parent, we tend to imagine the offspring of especially distinguished, notorious or wealthy people. Whatever they might go on to do by their own initiative, these children will always interest the world primarily as the son or daughter of X or Y. Far into their lives, their own personalities and aspirations will pale next to the key fact about them: that they are the child of John Lennon or Charles Darwin, that Mum was Marie Curie or Dad the inventor of the telephone.\n\nJohn Lennon and his son Julian Lennon, c. 1960\n\nHowever, such high-profile cases should not distract us from the universality of the theme in question: our parents need not have written \u2018Imagine\u2019 or discovered the theory of evolution in order to cast some very large shadows across our lives. These shadows might not be generated by money or fame, but by the strength and complexity of their personalities, which threaten to derail the sane and autonomous emergence of our own.\n\nIt is not only being the child of Elvis Presley or the Duke of Wellington that is problematic; it could be being the son or daughter of anyone with an immovable story in their head about who we need to be in order to deserve their love; any parent who leaves us longing for their approval through their inconsistent and unreliable affection; any parent who leaves us a legacy of guilt around sex or a worry that we have abandoned them by getting on with our lives; any parent who subtly signals that it would be better if we didn\u2019t succeed in love or could accept that our sibling is truly the worthwhile and good one.\n\nAn emotional shadow comprises a panoply of (normally secret) commands about what will be required of a child to warrant affection and, metaphysically speaking, a place on Earth. Rather than a kingdom or a fortune, the parent hands down a set of invisible rules: you should never rival your mother or father\u2019s achievements; you must never be happier than I was; you must love people who will deny you security; you should not think of yourself as a man or woman in the true sense; you must worry perpetually about money; you must forever feel that what you\u2019ve done isn\u2019t enough \u2026 Such are the hidden commandments that one generation slips unnoticed into the psyches of the next.\n\nAs a result, without fully seeing the contours of the shadow we operate under, in one relationship after another, we may be taken advantage of or wind up unable to feel comfortable receiving affection. At work, we may take early retirement from our real ambitions, telling ourselves, despite objective evidence to the contrary, that we don\u2019t have the talent required. Getting angry is impossible. We don\u2019t allow ourselves to be too amusing or too excited. We feel guilty every time we spend money on ourselves. We\u2019re living half the life that should be our due.\n\nAt the same time, typically, we think a lot more about our parents than we should. We are still scared of their anger, even though they might have been dead for twenty years. We fret about their well-being, as if they were in effect the child. We worry constantly that they might be sad or feeling rejected without us. We long for their approval and have them as our implicit audience for all our efforts. Our memory of their value system hampers us whenever we try to enjoy ourselves. Being mildly depressed feels safer and more respectful.\n\nAn emotional shadow is always, ultimately, created by blackmail. The deal is as follows: do as we want, or we will quietly choke off a supply of love; follow our way, or you must suffer and fail. There may be a lot of love from the shadow-throwing parent, but not of the sort that has the recipient\u2019s authentic autonomy at heart. Of course, it shouldn\u2019t matter who the child chooses to marry, what job they go for or how they bring up their own child in turn. To be a good parent is willingly to cede control, to let oneself be forgotten, never to loom too large in the child\u2019s imagination; not to present a massive obstacle to growth or achievement; not to become an object of worry or pity; not to be a source of fear or alarm; not to be the patron of self-esteem; to realise that offering someone protection never means having the right to control their identity and psychic functioning. The greatest gift of a parent is that they should be kind enough to give us the right to forget them.\n\nTo liberate ourselves at last, we need an adolescence. The full grandeur and seriousness of the concept of adolescence is too often obscured by its association with grumpiness and acne. But something very serious is at stake in this phase: permission to define oneself afresh and get far out of the shadow. Many of us, unknown to ourselves, managed not to have an adolescence at fifteen. There wasn\u2019t enough love to dare to. Not every parent is mature enough to allow themselves to be hated and belittled. We may be close to menopause or past retirement before we have the courage finally to dip a toe into adolescence.\n\nIn this process, it helps to talk to someone else about our family. The one thing about shadows is that they don\u2019t like attention. They would prefer if no one got to hear the story and the secret rules; these start to seem ridiculous and questionable once one puts them into words with an unbiased and kindly observer (it can help if he or she is about the same age as one\u2019s parents).\n\nTricky parents function as ghosts who can only be laid to rest by illumination. Our growth requires that we confront something abysmally sad: that we weren\u2019t loved as we might have been and that, as a result, we are far from properly free. We might have wasted a big part of our lives in a straitjacket not of our own making. Parents can expect a lot from us, but they don\u2019t have a right to our identities. At the same time, more clearly than ever, we can see that the point of true parental love is not to produce a clone, but to give encouragement to an autonomous new member of the human race \u2013 something we may now slowly be on the way to becoming.",

      "content": "### On friendliness to strangers\n\nMany of us, even the very kind ones, have a habit of walking through the world wearing a distinctly uncongenial and surly expression. If someone secretly photographed us on our way to the station or back from the shops, we might wince at our appearance: how stern our resting face is; how guarded we look; how misanthropic we seem. This could pain us in part because we know this is not the whole story. Our outward manner is at odds with a warmer, kinder, more vulnerable and sociable self that we know also exists and that seeks \u2013 largely in vain and often rather clumsily \u2013 to find expression. We are curmudgeons who harbour thwarted longings for new friendships.\n\nHowever, it should not be surprising that we have ended up so walled off and uninclined to share ourselves with strangers. Without realising it, we have been given long training in our attitudes. We have been told a lot about the world outside our insulated, predictable routines. We know that the stranger is, as a rule, pretty dangerous, has little to teach us, is likely to be sinister and may well be demented. Admittedly, we have generally not done our own research; we have let others find out for us. On this score, the media\u2019s conclusions are refreshed on our screens every hour of every day: others are to be feared; the unknown is to be avoided; the world (outside our close-knit circle) is mad.\n\nHowever, the reality is that, despite the surface evidence, strangers are always likely to resemble someone we already know well: us. Beneath the unfamiliar exterior, the distinctive accent, the alien occupation, the unexplored age or social bracket, the stranger is often merely a version of ourselves, the same essential human matter squeezed through a slightly different social and psychological mould:\n\n\u2022 The stranger is pained by regrets.\n\n\u2022 The stranger is wracked by longings.\n\n\u2022 The stranger, despite their impassive appearance, craves love and fellowship.\n\n\u2022 The stranger is lonely.\n\n\u2022 The stranger loves to laugh, but hasn\u2019t been silly and playful in a long time.\n\n\u2022 The stranger was once a baby.\n\n\u2022 The stranger might want to say hello.\n\nThe places where we most often see strangers \u2013 crowded shopping streets, airless subway carriages, airport concourses \u2013 tend not to lend plausibility to the above suggestions; they reinforce a message that others must be unfathomable and eerie. Yet feeling at home in the world relies to some extent on going beyond or to the side of the available evidence, refusing to be cowed by surface details and insisting on a theoretical capacity to locate the humanity of all beneath the outer casing.\n\nThis is the trick of that guileless artist of the everyday we call the friendly person. They take an attitude of basic goodwill out into unknown spaces. They assume that the stranger will be open to a smile, a reflection on the season, a supportive glance or an unobtrusive greeting. They will suspect that beneath a surly manner, the assistant might be aching to share something of themselves; that, even when there are only a few minutes available, it will be possible to say something heart-warming to a colleague or an official; that one can empathise across the barriers of age, class and profession.\n\nShyness has its insightful dimensions: it is infused with an awareness that we might be bothering someone with our presence; it is based upon an acute sense that a stranger could be dissatisfied or discomfited by us. The shy person is touchingly alive to the dangers of being a nuisance. Someone with no capacity for shyness is a scary possibility; they operate with a dismaying attitude of entitlement. They are friendly only because they haven\u2019t considered the possibility that the other person might have a disenchanted view of them.\n\nHowever, we often pay a heavy price for our reserve around people who might have opened their hearts to us, if only we had known how to manifest our own benevolence. We cling too jealously to our province. The pimply boy doesn\u2019t discover that he and the high school beauty share a taste in humour and similarly painful relationships with their fathers; the middle-aged lawyer never unearths a shared love of rockets with the neighbour\u2019s eight-year-old son. Races and ages continue not to mingle, to their collective detriments. Shyness is a touching yet ultimately excessive and unwarranted way of feeling unique.\n\nShyness is a touching yet ultimately excessive and unwarranted way of feeling unique.\n\nGuessing what might be going on in the hearts of strangers is a fundamental move of the artist. Without being able to know for sure, these characters bravely and beautifully presume that they might know a key secret bit of you \u2013 because they know the key secret bits of themselves. The American poet E.E. Cummings (1894\u20131962) didn\u2019t wait to be introduced and didn\u2019t worry about all the ways in which you and he were not going to be identical. He assumed that you would understand one or two important things \u2013 and he more or less got it right, which is why his poem \u2018since feeling is first\u2019 (1926) continues to resonate:\n\nsince feeling is first\n\nwho pays any attention\n\nto the syntax of things\n\nwill never wholly kiss you;\n\nwholly to be a fool\n\nwhile Spring is in the world\n\nCummings\u2019 talent was a species of confidence; a way of imagining a commonality between your deep self and his.\n\nWith some of that same confidence, we should dare more often to guess at the contents of the hearts of strangers. Without being presumptuous, we might offer a new person some of the reassurance we long for. We might show them a vulnerable part of ourselves; we could express warmth and curiosity; we might go out into the world and share a few tentative thoughts with a stranger and trust that they might one day be a friend.",

      "content": "### Dealing with depression\n\nAlmost half of us will suffer from depression at some point in our lives, but the condition remains badly misunderstood and therefore often poorly treated. At the heart of our collective difficulty with depression is a confusion about what it actually is \u2013 in particular, how it can be distinguished from a state all of us know very well and with which it shares a number of similarities: sadness. We often unwittingly apply to cases of depression assumptions drawn from an understanding of sadness, and therefore end up suffering far more than we should.\n\nOn the surface, there are similarities between those who are sad and those who are depressed. Both groups cry; both withdraw from the world; both complain of listlessness and a sense of alienation from their normal lives. But there is one categorical difference between depression and sadness: the sad person knows what they are sad about; the depressed person doesn\u2019t.\n\nSad people can, without difficulty, tell us what is troubling them. They are sad that their pet died, or that they lost their job, or that their friends are unkind. The depressed person is not capable of doing this. They may be tearful, but they cannot conclusively identify what has drained life of meaning for them: they simply say it has no meaning per se. They aren\u2019t depressed about X or Y as one might be sad about X or Y. They are simply depressed.\n\nThe inability of the depressed person to account for their mood can lay them open to unwarranted charges of faking, malingering or exaggerating. Friends looking for a solvable problem can end up frustrated by lack of progress. When pushed, the depressed person might latch on to rather odd or minor-sounding issues to account for their state: they might complain that there is no point going to work because the Earth is due to be absorbed by the Sun in 7.5 billion years. Or they might insist that life lacks all meaning because they\u2019ve broken a glass and everything is now completely hopeless.\n\nOne often hears that if depression has no obvious psychological causes, the problem must be bound up with an imbalance in brain chemistry, which can be treated with pills. This is an idea that greatly appeals to the pharmaceutical industry, but also to worried families, schools and employers who crave rapid and cost-effective solutions.\n\nHowever, there is another approach to depression that, although slower and more arduous, may be much more effective in the long term. This stems from insights drawn from psychotherapy, the discipline that arguably has been able to understand depression better than any other. The basic premise of psychotherapy is that the depressed person is not depressed for no reason; there is a reason. They are distressed about something, but that something is proving difficult to take on board, and has therefore been pushed into the outer zones of consciousness, from where it wreaks havoc on the whole person, prompting boundless feelings of nihilism.\n\nFor depressives, realising what they are concretely upset about would be too devastating. Therefore, they unconsciously choose to remain dead to everything as opposed to very distraught about something. Depression is sadness that has forgotten its true causes \u2013 forgotten because remembering may generate overwhelming, untenable feelings of pain and loss.\n\nWhat might these true causes be? Perhaps that we have married the wrong person, or that our sexuality isn\u2019t what we once believed, or that we are furious with a parent for their lack of care in childhood. In order to preserve a fragile peace of mind, one then \u2018chooses\u2019 (although that may sound more willed than it is in reality) to be depressed rather than to have a realisation. We pick unceasing numbness as protection against dreadful insight.\n\nTo make things even more difficult, the depressed person typically does not consciously feel that they are lacking insight. They are not aware of a gap in their self-understanding. Furthermore, they are often taught to assume that they are \u2018just depressed\u2019, as one might just be physically ill \u2013 a verdict that can appeal as much to the pharmaceutical industry as to certain people close to the depressed person with an interest in insights remaining buried.\n\nThere is another key difference between sadness and depression. Sad people are grief-stricken about something out in the world, but they aren\u2019t necessarily sad about themselves; their self-esteem is unaffected by their grief. Conversely, depressed people characteristically feel wretched about themselves and are full of self-recrimination, guilt, shame and self-loathing paranoia that may, at tragic extremes, culminate in suicidal thoughts.\n\nFor psychotherapy, the origins of this self-hatred lie in anger due for, but unable to be directed towards, someone else in the world, which has then turned against the sufferer. Wrathful feelings that should have gone outwards \u2013 towards a partner who is relentlessly defensive and denies one sex, or a parent who humiliated one in childhood \u2013 are driven back onto the sufferer and start to attack them. The feeling \u2018X has let me down horribly\u2019 turns into the unpleasant but in some ways more bearable \u2018I\u2019m an unworthy and unbearable wretch.\u2019 One becomes self-hating as a defence against the risks of hating someone else.\n\nAlso worth noting is that, in many cases, depression is associated with an apparently opposite mood, a euphoric state termed \u2018mania\u2019; hence the term \u2018manic depressive\u2019. The mania in question looks, from a distance, something like happiness, just as depression can resemble sadness. But in one area, the relationship between mania and happiness is identical to that between depression and sadness. The common element is a disavowed self-knowledge. In mania, one is euphoric but cannot go into one\u2019s own deep mind and discover its bitter truths. This explains one of the leading characteristics of manic people: their habit of being in flight from themselves, talking too fast about nothing, over-exercising, working continuously or spending too much \u2013 all as an escape from a submerged grief, rage and loss.\n\nIt is from this kind of diagnosis that a suggested cure emerges. What people in depression need above all is a chance to arrive at insight. For this, they will tend to need a supportive and patient listener. They may also benefit from temporary use of medication, if used appropriately, to lift their mood just enough so that they can endure a conversation. However, the assumption is not that brain chemistry is where the problem either begins or ends; the despair is caused by an undigested, unknown and unresolved trauma. Far from needing to be taken through reasons to trust that life is beautiful, depressives must be allowed to feel and to remember specific damage, and to be granted a fundamental sense of the legitimacy of their emotions. They need to be allowed to be angry, and for the anger to settle on the right, awkward targets.\n\nThe goal in treating depression is to move a sufferer from feeling limitlessly despairing to mourning the loss of something in particular: the last twenty years, a marriage, a hope that one would be loved by one\u2019s father, a career \u2026 However agonising the insight and mourning might be, these must always be preferable to allowing loss to contaminate the totality of one\u2019s perspective. There are plenty of dreadful things in every life, which is why it is normal to feel sad on a regular basis. But there are also a sufficient number of things that remain beautiful and hopeful, so long as one has been allowed to understand and know one\u2019s pain and anger and adequately mourn one\u2019s losses.",

      "content": "### Arguing more nakedly\n\nIn long-term relationships, we are likely to spend up to 10% of our time in the intoxicating and all-consuming business of arguing. Each argument will seem to be uniquely about itself. It will have its distinct flashpoint, features, injustices, stupidities and what to us appear to be self-evident truths that the partner is blithely resisting: the absurdity of proposing to leave at 7.23 p.m. when we had both agreed \u2013 only two hours ago \u2013 that we would leave no later than 7.10 p.m.; the idiocy of telling a younger son he could have extra screen time when we\u2019d already explained to him that he\u2019d breached his limit; the insult of the partner laughing aloud at our sister-in-law\u2019s cheap jibe against us at the family reunion \u2026\n\nFaced with such offences, we dig in like eager and wellpaid lawyers, crash investigators or detectives. We marshal evidence. We say that on the basis of this or that, they are obviously going to have to rethink their line and surrender to our perspective. The first round may begin peacefully enough, but the urgency and annoyance stand to increase as the second and third rounds unfold, each team adding a little vengeance and irritation to their proclamations. Sometimes, with the logic of the argument so stubbornly resisted by the other party, voices will be raised, faces will flush, someone (whom we have named in our will and to whom we have otherwise given our lives) may be called a c*** or a b******, a door might be slammed and a gloom could descend that will take a good two days to clear.\n\nSuch rigmaroles are so shameful and dispiriting that we tend not to mention their entrails to others \u2013 and others in turn keep quiet about their squabbles to us, deepening our feelings of isolation and embarrassment. We say that \u2018we\u2019ve had a bit of a tiff\u2019 or are \u2018going through a bad patch\u2019 in lieu of confessing openly that the person we love appears (sometimes at least) to have substantially ruined our lives.\n\nThe great error we make is to assume that the way to fix an argument is to attempt to reach an objective truth that, once brought out into the open, can neutralise the force of the fierce offence we feel. However, there is an unfortunate and somewhat paradoxical aspect of arguments in relationships: it doesn\u2019t really matter what the truth is; it\u2019s by the by who has the stronger case; it\u2019s irrelevant who can \u2018win\u2019.\n\nBehind, or beneath, an argument, there is only ever one thing we really want from our partners: to know we are loved. We are arguing so bitterly not because a client has hired us in a courtroom, but because we are emotionally in pain, because the relationship has forced us to make ourselves vulnerable in front of another person on whom we depend. Beneath our furious eloquence, we are longing for reassurance. We are calling them a c*** in lieu of asking them tearfully if they still love us and why, in that case, they have hurt us so much.\n\nRather than dwell tirelessly on the surface complaints, we might learn to cut straight to the emotional substratum of the situation and raise one of six possible objections to the partner:\n\n1. I feel you don\u2019t value me.\n\n2. I feel abandoned.\n\n3. I feel not good enough.\n\n4. I feel you are trying to control me.\n\n5. I feel you\u2019re not accepting who I really am.\n\n6. I feel unseen and unheard.\n\nIf the words seem too hard to utter, we might simply paste the list to the fridge door and point mutely to it at the height of a dispute. Rather than try to win a proxy managerial battle over scheduling or bedtimes, we might immediately disclose the emotional explanation for our upset: \u2018When you are late for something we\u2019d agreed on, I feel unseen and unheard\u2019; \u2018When you contradict me in front of my family, I feel abandoned.\u2019\n\nBy a grievous logic, it often seems that the only way to feel safe is to punch back, when in love we will be much safer (that is, much more likely to be a recipient of affection and atonement) if we manage calmly to reveal our wound to its (usually unwitting) perpetrator. The best response is not to make ourselves more impregnable, but to dare to be a little less defended.\n\nDifferences of opinion between partners may crop up over anything, but arguments \u2013 the sort of heated matches that end in slammed doors and insults \u2013 are only ever about one thing: the anxiety of being excessively vulnerable before someone we adore and can\u2019t control. It may look like a fight over scheduling or childcare, but really it\u2019s a fight about the terror of emotional abandonment. If we kept this idea in mind, we might save ourselves so much time in legalistic point scoring \u2013 possibly four hours a week or more that could be put to use gardening, helping the aged or learning a foreign language. There would be so much less to shout about, and so many more exciting things to get on with.",

      "content": "### The stranger you\u2019ve been living alongside for years\n\nAfter we have been living alongside a partner for a few years, there is no more common response than a feeling of intense (though normally very privately held) boredom. However intriguing they might have been at the start, and however accomplished they remain in theory, we tend to end up in the unfortunate position of knowing most of their anecdotes, of being able to predict their responses, of having seen them from every angle and of being left to smile wanly at their now awkwardly familiar set of jokes. Without meaning to be disloyal, our eyes develop a tendency to drift. We can fall for faces we glimpse momentarily on the subway or in the grocery store, and that seem to harbour all the charm and depths of the unknown. Haunted by an impression of mesmerising but unattainable mystery, we become irritable and ungrateful towards the one person who has opted to spend their life in our company.\n\nIt is understandable that we should seek novelty in love; our characteristic error is to believe that this must mean we should seek out a new partner. Restless, we miss out on a critically redemptive idea: that the person we have been with for so long, perhaps for many years, is in fact a stranger. Paradoxically, they are a stranger precisely because our physical proximity and familiar joint routines have lulled us into assuming that we know them thoroughly already, and that dissuades us from continuing to bring to bear on them the kind of searching intelligence we might apply to someone new. It is our assumption of knowledge that deals our curiosity a fatal blow and encourages us to feel listless and dissatisfied where we should more fairly remain inquisitive and enchanted.\n\nIn the early days, we are helped by the obviousness of our ignorance. We understand that we need to get to know the basics: the structure of their family; their educational and career trajectories; their friendships and travels; their cultural tastes and domestic habits. But at a certain point, astonishingly, we stop. We believe we have done enough; we trust that it might be possible to understand someone in the course of 150 hours or so of chat. And then we shift to practicalities, to reflections on the news, the latest things at work and when someone might be coming to check the boiler. We no longer expect big disclosures and cease to prepare or hunt for them. Our partial knowledge functions as a dispiriting reason not to ask for more. We fail to extend to our partner the basic insight we all know from within: that we are never quite done with understanding the mind; that only a tiny portion of its endless canyons is ever illuminated by reason (and therefore available to oneself, let alone another person); and that we can orbit consciousness for years without ever grasping more than a fraction of its content. We confuse seeing our lover every day with understanding their soul.\n\nOur neglect of the complexities of our partner mirrors our jaded attitude to the world around us more generally. We are no less lacking in curiosity about our country, our city or our own home. In these cases too we look around and see only banality and the mundane, and are prone to long for the obviously exotic and foreign instead.\n\nOne counter to this settled ingratitude lies in certain works of art that contain coded pleas for us to notice the intricacy and beauty of overlooked aspects of the everyday. Over the centuries, artists have used their talents to say what in effect amounts to: \u2018Notice the astonishing sunlight as it hits the top of the trees, the delicacy of the water rippling by the shore, the solemnity of the fog hugging the landscape at dusk \u2026\u2019 They challenge us to notice afresh what we think we have already seen.\n\nFor example, the Impressionist artist \u00c9douard Manet in 1880 looked afresh at a bunch of asparagus, looking at the spring vegetable with the appreciative sensitivity of a young child or a Martian newly landed on the planet. Where we might have been prepared to recognise only dull white stalks, the artist observed and then reproduced vigour, colour and individuality, recasting this humble foodstuff as a sacramental object through which we might recover faith in life more broadly.\n\n\u00c9douard Manet, A Bunch of Asparagus, 1880\n\nIn the spirit of Manet, we might turn to consider our partner as if they too were an alien, wondrous object worthy of sustained appreciation and study. We might begin by inviting them out on a date and talk to them as if we knew almost nothing about them \u2013 which, it turns out, we don\u2019t. With newfound modesty, we could consider all the topics that we had skated over far too quickly at the start and then never bothered to return to. What was their relationship with their mother like? What did their parents fail to understand about them? In what ways were they misunderstood as a child? Over the main course we might turn to their careers: what gives their work purpose? In what areas do they lack confidence? Where do they see their essential strengths? We could then move on to their aspirations: what remains exciting for them? What would they be sad if they never achieved? What are their hopes for the future? What, in their eyes, is the meaning of their life?\n\nLater in the evening, in a similar vein, we could remember that we know next to nothing about them sexually, even if we have made love to them hundreds of times and slept many thousands of nights with them: where do they most like to be touched? What turns them on? What are their most intense fantasies? We could put aside the veil of partial knowledge that has prevented us from seeing them and unclothe them properly as if for the very first time. And we might do this not once, but as a regular exercise to remind us of the ongoing mystery of someone we could only ever think of as familiar by error and hubris.\n\nWith such techniques in mind, we stand to recognise something at once alarming and relieving: we don\u2019t need to go out and find a new lover in order to recover a sense of excitement. We don\u2019t need to learn to look at new people with jaded eyes; we need new eyes to look afresh at the familiar world around us \u2013 and, in particular, the total stranger in the bed beside us.",

      "content": "### Learning to lay down boundaries\n\nOne of the reasons why our lives might be less than they could be is that we have missed out on an awkward-sounding but critical art, whose absence we may never even have noticed: that of laying down boundaries.\n\nLaying down a boundary involves informing those around us \u2013 colleagues, parents, children, lovers \u2013 of a given set of objectively reasonable things that we are going to require in order to feel respected and happy, while doing so in a way that conveys confidence, self-possession, warmth and a mixture of kindness and strength.\n\nThose who can successfully lay down boundaries will tell their small child that, even though they love them very much, once this game is over, Mummy or Daddy is not going to play another round and it will be time to go upstairs for hair washing, and biting or kicking is not the answer, as we\u2019ve discussed before. The good boundary-builder will wait until everyone is well rested to tell their partner that, although they appreciate them taking the initiative in many areas, when it comes to their own family, they want to be left in charge, and therefore don\u2019t think it was right for the partner to call up their mother-in-law without warning in order to arrange the forthcoming holidays. At work, the boundaried manager will tell their new hire that, although they want to be supportive where possible, it simply is not their role to complete schedules or manage budgets for others.\n\nHowever, because most of us have not been educated in this byway of emotional maturity, the boundaries are either non-existent or else get thrown up in a jerky and destructive manner; as the technical language has it, we are either too compliant or too rigid. Therefore, Mummy or Daddy might never say that they\u2019ve had enough of the game and, even when wilting, will play on late into the night, ensuring that their child will be exhausted and cross the next day, as well as craving the security that comes from knowing that their grown-up is \u2018grown up\u2019 enough to say no. (If there\u2019s one thing we crave more than that our wishes are granted, it\u2019s someone responsible enough to resist granting them all.) In a relationship, we might never explain what we require in order to feel content, and therefore either store up our resentments (and may therefore grow unable to have sex) or else burst into unexplained rages that exhaust our partner\u2019s capacity for love. At work, meanwhile, we might develop a reputation as a friendly pushover or as an unreasonable tyrant who it becomes fun to try to evade.\n\nThose who can\u2019t lay down boundaries have invariably not had their own boundaries respected in their early lives. Someone didn\u2019t allow them to say when they were unhappy with a genuinely difficult situation; someone didn\u2019t care much about their hurt feelings or distinctive hopes. Someone insinuated that being good meant falling in line, always and immediately. No one modelled the skill of winning, graceful objection. Now, when the time comes to make a request of others, three powerful anxieties bedevil the boundary-less person:\n\n\u2022 If I speak up, they will hate me.\n\n\u2022 If I speak up, I will become a target for retribution.\n\n\u2022 If I speak up, I will feel like a horrible person.\n\nAlthough such fears manifest themselves as unquestionable certainties, they are amenable to gentle probing. People almost never hate those who make polite and reasonably framed demands; in fact, they tend to respect and like them a little more. They feel they are in the presence of a mature and kindly authority that appears worthy of their time, as well as seeming rare and somewhat thrilling. Frustrating someone\u2019s wishes does not have to be evidence of selfishness; it may signal a noble concern for another\u2019s long-term well-being and flourishing. One can adore someone, wish them the very best, have the kindest intentions towards them and still, diplomatically yet decisively, tell them no.\n\nAn alternative response to building boundaries is the habit of throwing up walls topped with razor wire ringed by machine gun turrets, or a tendency to become swiftly and gratingly defensive. The manically defensive person too is labouring under a set of unfortunate misapprehensions:\n\n\u2022 Everyone is trying to hurt them.\n\n\u2022 No one will listen unless they hit back with immense force.\n\n\u2022 Their needs can never truly be met.\n\nHowever, the alternative to lacking boundaries is not violent defensiveness. We should not let boundary building be undermined by its most zealous practitioners; there is always a means to make a sound case without reaching for a weapon.\n\nIt is notable that the problem of boundary building is particularly acute not so much around strangers but in intimate life. We may be able to fight our corner with people we care little about (the person at the car rental desk, the tax official), but the problem comes when we are dealing with someone who we know loves us and who we have allowed into our emotional inner sanctum. It is as if, in a deep part of our minds, we cannot reconcile the notion that someone might at once be genuinely caring and capable of betraying our best interests. We find it hard to be simultaneously intimate and, always, a touch vigilant. What should help us to absorb that eventuality is to remember that, just as we can say no and still be kind, so another can have harmed us and yet remain, in their essence, good.\n\nIt takes a little self-confidence and courage to be able to notice just how bad we may be at the art of boundarylaying. We may have spent a large chunk of our lives already in an essentially passive relationship to everyday infringements by people close to us. But we are not a piece of helpless flotsam on the river of others\u2019 wishes; we have agency, direction and \u2013 as it were \u2013 a rudder. The price to pay for affection is not compliance. We can gradually take on board an implausible-sounding but redemptive notion: we can prove loveable and worthy of respect and, at the same time, when the occasion demands it, utter a warm but definitive \u2018no\u2019.",

      "content": "### The benefits of insecurity\n\nWe tend to assume that the best foundations for a good shared life for a couple lie in making an explicit commitment (probably in front of 200 guests and a large cake) to staying together for the very long term: the more we are guaranteed that someone is going to stay with us pretty much indefinitely, the more we can mobilise our best sides and bring our virtues into play.\n\nHowever, it might pay to consider an alternative and more paradoxical truth: that a healthy dose of insecurity, of wondering whether the other person truly is duty-bound to stay with us forever and vice versa, might be the ingredient that helps us to be better people, to curtail our more self-indulgent sides and to conduct a more flourishing and valuable relationship. Rather than drowning in insecurity, might we not benefit from emphasising and embracing the fragility of our alliance? Rather than a solemn promise that this is forever, might not the most romantic move (in the sense of what is most likely to enhance and sustain love) be a gentle reminder that we might not be an item by next month?\n\nInsecurity sounds unromantic, but one of its major consequences is the possibility of appreciating why we remain together. So long as we believe that we are irrevocably attached, there is no need to feel grateful for a partner\u2019s positive sides or to notice their contributions to our welfare. All these are merely a given, part of the fabric of our emotional reality.\n\nIt tells us something of the importance of remembering endings that, for centuries, the most fitting piece of interior decoration for a prosperous person\u2019s study was thought to be a skull: a real skull, with ghoulish eye sockets and anguished-looking rotten teeth, so that, as merchants or politicians went about their business, they would never be far from a reminder that every second was of value.\n\nPhilippe de Champaigne, Still-Life with a Skull vanitas, c. 1671\n\nWe should have our own skulls around love. For much of our romantic lives, however much the intellectual idea is in place, the reality of love\u2019s demise remains only in shadow. It is not a concrete, powerful conviction that courses through us every hour. And although this allows us to bring a reassuring degree of innocence to our plans, it is also the breeding ground for emotional complacency. We may not experience ourselves as inured to our partners, but in the lackadaisical way we often approach them, we implicitly behave as if waking up every day next to them has privately been guaranteed to us by an all-knowing god, rather than as a gift daily offered to us by a fellow option-rich mortal.\n\nAnother paradoxical-sounding result of good insecurity is that it reduces the dangers of bitterness and suppressed irritation. So long as we have no option but to stay, a lot of what we are unhappy about may end up hidden, because our complaints have nowhere to go. We can lose the right to have our needs listened to and respected because both sides know that there is no alternative. Our threats have no ammunition in them; we can stamp our feet like impotent emperors. However, when the relationship is fruitfully insecure, we can confidently state our problems with how things are, both sides knowing that our words mean something. And, of course, our partner can in turn make their dissatisfactions plain to us with equal force. We are importing into the depths of our relationships some of the qualities that attended their fragile beginnings: the empathy, the care and the effort to be pleasant. In a state of constant insecurity, the important focus becomes on why it might be exciting or helpful or interesting to stay together; it turns the decision to remain in a couple into a loving, authentic choice rather than a prison to which no one has the key.\n\nIt may sound kind, but we are doing another person, and ourselves, a disservice when we promise that we will never leave them. There is nothing more likely to usher in the death of love than the whispered words:I will always be with you. We can appreciate the touching sentiment, but we should never let ourselves become trapped in its many asphyxiating consequences.\n\nAlong the way, insecurity is also sexually enticing. There is nothing more devastating to sexual self-confidence than our knowledge that we could never appeal to anyone but our partner, or that they have themselves grown invisible to the rest of humanity. We want what others want \u2013 which might include slipping our hand inside our momentarily intriguingly distant partner\u2019s top. It is when our lover spots us flirting with an unknown person at a party, or when we are forced to note how appealing they are to an audience of strangers that sex will once again be more than a chore. It is not for nothing that the most intense sex that long-established couples ever have is right after a furious argument; that is, after a vivid encounter with the independence and fiery competence of someone they had for too long mistaken for furniture. Feeling jealous is simultaneously the most abhorrent emotion and the one most necessary to galvanise us back into erotic life.\n\nTo get the benefits of insecurity, leaving has to be a real possibility. Our readiness to quit can\u2019t be uttered as a hollow threat blurted out when we are fed up or angry, if both sides know that we would in reality struggle to pack our own suitcase or operate our bank account. It has to be built upon a mature realisation that it would be plausible for us to be on our own; that we could manage our own finances, construct a decent social life and do the grocery shopping by ourselves.\n\nIf there are children involved, it is sometimes argued that they need to know that we will never part in order to have the security to develop without anxiety. But this is a misreading of the benefits of eternal promises. Maintaining insecurity in a couple is not about trying not to be together; it is about understanding the best preconditions for staying. Therefore, one of the most constructive things we might do in the pursuit of a more fulfilling relationship is to look in an estate agent\u2019s window and work out, realistically, how we could get an apartment for one. With a secure, positive sense of our own capacity for independence, we would learn to see our relationship not as the union of two desperate, option-less people, unable and too frightened to face life alone, but of two creative, independent, sexually alluring individuals who could have an interesting time apart but have chosen to take real pleasure in being with one another to enrich themselves and grow \u2013 at least for the time being \u2026",

      "content": "### Untragic endings\n\nNews of the end of relationships tends to be greeted with deep solemnity in our societies; it is hard not to think of a break-up except in terms of a minor tragedy. People will offer condolences as they might at a funeral. This in turn reflects an underlying philosophy of love: we are taught that the natural and successful outcome of any love story should be to seek to remain with a person until their death or our own, and, by implication, that any break-up must be interpreted as a failure governed by overwhelming hostility on one or both sides.\n\nHowever, there is another scenario in which we understand that we are separating not because our relationship has gone badly but because it has gone well; it is ending because it has succeeded. Rather than breaking up with feelings of hurt, bitterness, regret and guilt, we are parting with a sense of mutual gratitude and joint accomplishment.\n\nThis counter-intuitive but real possibility comes from having kept a crucial question in mind throughout our time together: what is this relationship for? The enquiry may feel negative; we imagine it being asked in a disillusioned tone of voice. But it can, and should, be asked positively and eagerly, with the aim of finding a good answer that goes to the heart of love.\n\nNormally, we imagine love as a kind of ownership: full of admiration, two people agree to buy one another as they might a static, beguiling object. But there is another, more dynamic and less hidebound way to interpret love: as a particular kind of education. In this view, a relationship comprises a mutual attempt to learn from and teach something to another person. We are drawn to our partners because we want to be educated by them and vice versa; we love them because we see in them things that we long for but that are missing in us; we aspire to grow under the tutelage of love.\n\nFor example, a partner might at the outset have been confident but gentle \u2013 a combination that, until we met them, seemed impossible. Or they knew how to laugh at themselves, while we were too withheld and solemn to do so. Or they had a practical competence that we found delightful and moving precisely because it was lacking in us. We could accurately say in such cases that the purpose of the relationship was to teach us confidence, or gentleness, or how to laugh at our own idiocy, or how to become more dexterous \u2013 or a thousand other qualities depending on who we both are. The point is that there will be some specific and important things we need to do together that define what the relationship is for.\n\nBy being with the partner, by intertwining our lives, by listening to them, even by being criticised or nagged by them, we will gradually be able to internalise what they have to teach us. But there may come a point where we have absorbed as much from them as we can. Thanks to our partner, we are more mature beings than we were when we got together. We\u2019re more balanced and wiser; they\u2019ve helped us to become a little more like the people we always wished to be.\n\nPrecisely because our relationship has had a great, intimate, loving purpose, it can be completed. It can be finished in the sense in which a novel can be finished \u2013 not because the writer got fed up of the trials of writing, but because they have, through plenty of difficulties, brought the project to a good resolution. Or \u2013 more poignantly, perhaps \u2013 a relationship can be finished in the way that childhood can be finished. Thanks to the devotion of their parents, a child arrives at the point at which, in order to progress further, they need to leave home. They are not being kicked out in anger or running away in despair; they are leaving because the work of childhood has been done. This is not a rejection of love; it is love\u2019s good consequence. Finishing is not a sign of failure, but of background success.\n\nThe difference in these cases is that we have clearly understood what all our efforts were for. There was a goal in mind: the writing should not go on forever; the child should leave home. But because we have not asked what our relationship is for, we can\u2019t normally achieve this sense of having reached a proper ending. Or else we are refusing to ask because the only motive for the relationship is to ensure that we are not alone \u2013 which is never a good enough reason to monopolise someone else\u2019s life.\n\nIn an ideal relationship, the sense of completion would be mutual. The painful reality, however, is that we may sometimes want to leave while our partner wants us to stay together. But the idea of love as education can still apply: our unbearable conflicts mean that we have stopped being able to teach one another anything. We may know important qualities they should learn, but we\u2019re not the right teacher; we currently lack the patience, skill, charm or self-confidence to transmit insights in a way that will work for them. We have done all we can. Our task is complete not because our partner has nothing left to learn, but because we aren\u2019t the right person to guide them; we are entitled to leave without feeling we are abandoning anyone. We can avoid feeling devastated by a break-up by knowing that there are still many other ways in which we need to develop. We may have learnt so much, but we are still far from complete. It is just that the lessons we now have to take on board are going to come from someone else \u2013 or from the always educative experience of being on our own for a while.",

There exists a cataclysmically painful but little-known type who we might describe as the hardest person in the world to break up with.\n\nA relationship with this type begins like this: you are very drawn to them. Perhaps you are attracted to them physically, and their personality is compelling as well. You admire them and, in areas, feel sympathy for them too; there is probably something in their past that really interests and touches you. You have no desire to break up; in fact, you\u2019d love this to last till the end.\n\nFor their part, they seem to be keen on you. They show no interest in leaving you. They want this to be for the long term; perhaps forever.\n\nThere is a problem, however, so grave yet so hidden, so damaging yet so hard to grasp, that you can only face up to it slowly. You realise that the partner whom you love and who says they love you is having a grievously detrimental effect on your mental or physical well-being.\n\nWhat wrong might the partner be perpetrating? It is a spectrum. At one extreme, they might be physically abusive. But the spectrum is long and contains all sorts of insidious ways in which, without ever raising a hand, one human can badly damage another. They might be having affairs, or spending too much money. They might be addicted to something. Or \u2013 and this can be hard to get a grip on \u2013 they may be constantly \u2018absent\u2019. They show no reliable warmth towards you; they never initiate any touch; they may never hug. They are present but not really there.\n\nProbably, as soon as these problems first arose, you started to complain. But you did so softly, or sarcastically, or bitterly. Not head-on. After all, you love them and you\u2019re a good boy or girl. It can take a long time \u2013 years, decades \u2013 before you find your voice and feel able to raise an adult objection. What then happens when you ask these types to face up to the harm they are doing to you? There are two main responses.",

If they don\u2019t raise their game, you will leave (even though of course that\u2019s the last thing you really want; you love this person!).\n\nYou may be shaking and flushed after you have spoken. You\u2019re feeling you might be crazy (surely it\u2019s crazy to threaten to leave someone you love and who says they love you). You had expected all sorts of dark responses on their part. But something that appears lovely now happens. They admit it! They confess! They say, \u2018My goodness you\u2019re right!

This is one with the same dynamics, but with one extra twist. When you finally confront them with the problem, they don\u2019t confess; they deny it. They tell you you\u2019re dreaming. You\u2019re imagining it; the problem lies with you, they say. At the same time, they become incensed and offended at the suggestion you\u2019re making. \u2018You\u2019re so cynical about me. Don\u2019t you trust me?! How rude you are about me! Why don\u2019t you have more faith in me and in us?\u2019 And they push back: \u2018you\u2019re just as neurotic as you say I am. The problem is with you and not me \u2026\u2019\n\nThis is minefield territory. Relationships and their interactions are generally not filmed, so it\u2019s hard for you to back up your claims or even be sure of your verdicts when they are relentlessly challenged. Is the loved one spending too much money, or am I just nagging? Are they actually flirting, or am I just jealous? Are they failing to initiate sex, or am I just insecure?\n\nThe partner whom you love and really don\u2019t want to leave, and who says they love you, adds to the difficulty by telling you, with authority, that you\u2019re crazy; that you\u2019re seeing things; that you\u2019re too demanding; that there\u2019s something wrong with you \u2026\n\nYou are probably an open-minded, nice, intelligent person \u2013 and open-minded, nice, intelligent people tend to give others the benefit of the doubt. After all, such types know they aren\u2019t perfect. They\u2019re aware of everything they get wrong; they don\u2019t feel they are brilliant in every way. Perhaps it\u2019s plausible that here, too, you may be seeing things that aren\u2019t really there. Why insist, especially when you love your partner and want to be with them? Here is a nice person telling you that you\u2019re a bit mad and imagining things. It\u2019s a dispiriting message, but if disregarding your impulses (and your emotional needs) is the price you pay for keeping a relationship aloft, maybe it\u2019s worth thinking of yourself as a bit insane. At least you\u2019ll still have a partner.\n\nSo, more time passes, and you stay put. In that time, probably there are more children, more entanglements and less of life left for you to build on afterwards. There is also likely to be a destruction of your sense of reality. You will probably start to feel as mad as you\u2019re being subtly told you are. You might have a breakdown \u2013 which isn\u2019t an ideal backdrop against which to leave anyone.\n\nAll that said, in both of the above cases, you will have to leave eventually. Your long-term mental well-being depends on it. You will feel extremely alone with this decision. You will be left to wrestle either with feelings that you are nasty (for leaving someone who promises again and again to change) or that you are mad (for leaving someone who tells you that you\u2019re demented to doubt their sincerity). You will have to destroy a relationship on the basis of an inner sense that your partner is doing something detrimental to your well-being and cannot stop themselves from doing it, despite telling you they love you.\n\nIn order to leave, you will need to think: \u2018I am in love with someone who is damaged. They cannot realistically change and may even be using me as a reason not to change. Or they are in denial and are abusing my credulity and self-doubt not to look more honestly into themselves.\u2019 You will have to think: \u2018there is probably something in my past, a history of putting up with intolerable situations, that makes me a long-term sucker for this sort of suffering.\u2019\n\nMountain climbers know that certain peaks cannot be climbed alone; you need a climbing buddy. In this context, let\u2019s call them a psychotherapist or a very good friend \u2013 the sort who can reassure you of your sanity and who can be there for you when you feel as if you\u2019re making the worst choice in the world, even though you are making the very best decision of your life.",

The word derives (somewhat unfairly for him and his family) from the 19th-century Austrian aristocrat and writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836\u20131895).\n\nAs a young man, Leopold made a conventional marriage to a fellow member of the nobility, Aurora von R\u00fcmelin, but he discovered that his sexual tastes could not be accommodated within the relationship. When he was contacted by an admiring reader, Baroness Fanny Pistor, ostensibly seeking help with her writing, he was able to discover a new aspect to his sexual identity. What he wanted was for Fanny to dress in a fur coat, flog him, dominate him and treat him with haughty cruelty. He wanted Fanny to call him \u2018Gregor\u2019 (a popular servant\u2019s name at that time) and, when they travelled, despite being far wealthier than her, he insisted on being forced to sit in third class while she took her place in first.\n\nLeopold\u2019s proclivities, which he wrote up in a lightly disguised novella called Venus in Furs, caught the interest of the Austrian psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840\u20131902). Despite protestations from Leopold\u2019s family, he included them in his landmark compendium of kinks, Psychopathology of Sex (1890), thereby introducing the world to the term \u2018masochist\u2019: a person sexually aroused by receiving pain.\n\nWe now understand a sexual masochist as somebody who might want to be called obscenities, have their hair pulled or their skin scratched, or be ordered to describe themselves in derogatory and humiliating terms (with consent, it must be stressed; anything else would merely be abusive). The mystery is why this could prove so appealing, to which psychotherapy has an answer. For the masochist, cruel treatment in sex play is experienced as relief from the inauthenticity and alienating sentimentality that can otherwise flow from being treated with generous respect. At a deep and compartmentalised level masochists tend not to think too highly of themselves. They harbour intense suspicions of their own characters and nature, believing themselves to be at least in part wicked and impure, and therefore unworthy of unconflicted gentleness and good manners. If others insist on handling them with kid gloves, they cannot feel seen and understood. It only starts to seem properly real and hence properly exciting when a special partner spots the very deep secret about them: that they are (at least for a time and in a certain way) a little shit who deserves a severe beating.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon of masochism began with and has remained most fully connected to sex, it exists no less powerfully in the emotional realm. Indeed, there may be many more emotional masochists at large than there are sexual ones \u2013 and certainly many more of us who are unaware of our own proclivities in this area.\n\nAs with sexual masochism, emotional masochism is rooted in self-suspicion. Emotional masochists do not deep down feel as if they are loveable people worthy of careful appreciation and kindness. A powerful aspect of them suspects that they might be stupid pieces of shit. If someone were to enter their orbit and tell them otherwise, if they were to revere and praise them, flatter and stroke them, the emotional masochist might choke on an instinctive sense of disgust at a suitor who seemed not to understand the truth about them, and would soon dismiss them as needy and deluded. Why would anyone feel better about them than they feel about themselves? The emotional masochist will instead direct their energies towards relationships with people whose behaviour will accord much more tightly and reassuringly with their own self-assessments: those who can be guaranteed to act sarcastically, unfaithfully or frigidly.\n\nIt is an innocent enough error to fall into a relationship with an unsatisfactory person \u2013 the healthiest among us do so all the time. What marks out the masochist is their inability to exit a grim union. They can\u2019t imagine life without the person who makes life intolerable.\n\nIn the end, the difference between sexual and emotional masochists is that the former tend to know that this is what they are. In order to stop being an emotional masochist, it is vital to start to imagine that one might be an emotional masochist; to see \u2013 perhaps for the first time \u2013 the ways in which one is engaged in self-sabotage and has made an unconscious commitment to loneliness and frustration. The task is also to see that the origins of all this lie, as ever, in early life. The masochist is liable to have relied on the affections of a parental figure who exhibited, alongside love, a high degree of cruelty, neglect or violence, leading the child to a conviction that their destiny lies in suffering rather than fulfilment.\n\nThe most relevant difference between sexual and emotional masochism is that the former will, in the right circumstances, be a lot of fun, whereas the latter is only ever bitter hell. We owe it to ourselves to see the myriad ways in which we may have been holding ourselves back, not out of any kink or necessity, but because our past has unfairly imbued us with a sense that a terrible life is all we deserve.",

He not only spoke a great deal about love, but also advocated that we love some surprising people.\n\nAt one point (described in chapter 7 of Luke\u2019s Gospel), he goes to a dinner party and a local prostitute turns up, much to the disgust of the hosts. But Jesus is friendly and kind and defends her against everyone else\u2019s criticism. In a way that shocks the other guests, he insists that she is a good person at heart.\n\nIn another story (in Matthew, chapter 8), Jesus is approached by a man affected with leprosy. He\u2019s in a terrible state. But Jesus isn\u2019t shocked and does not shy away from him; instead he reaches out his hand and touches the man. Despite the man\u2019s horrendous appearance, here is someone (in Jesus\u2019s eyes) that is deserving of closeness and kindness. In a similar vein, at other times, Jesus argues that tax collectors, thieves and adulterers are not to be thought of as outside the circle of love.\n\nMany centuries after Jesus\u2019s death, the medieval thinker Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274) defined what Jesus was getting at in this way of talking about love: the person who truly understands love could love anyone. In other words, true love is not specific in its target; it doesn\u2019t fixate on particular qualities; it is open to all of humanity, even (and in a way especially) its less appealing examples.\n\nToday this can sound like a strange notion of what love is, because our background ideas about love tend to be closely tied to a dramatic experience: that of falling in love; that is, finding one very specific person immensely attractive, exciting and free of any failings or drawbacks. Love is, we feel, a response to the overt perfection of another person.\n\nHowever \u2013 via some admittedly extreme examples \u2013 a very important aspect of love is pushed to the fore in Jesus\u2019s vision \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to be a Christian to benefit from it.\n\nAt the heart of this kind of love is an effort to see beyond the outwardly unappealing surface of another human, in search of the tender, interesting, scared and vulnerable person inside.\n\nWhat we know as the \u2018work\u2019 of love is the emotional, imaginative labour that is required to peer behind an off-putting facade. Our minds tend to resist such a move. They follow well-worn grooves that feel at once familiar and justified. For instance, if someone has hurt us, we naturally see them as horrible. The thought that they might themselves be hurting inside feels weird. If a person looks odd, we find it difficult to recognise that there might be many touching things about them deep down.\n\nIf unpleasant events happen in someone\u2019s life \u2013 if they lose their job, or start drinking too much, or even develop a serious illness \u2013 we might be tempted to hold them responsible for their misfortunes. It takes quite a deliberate, taxing effort of the mind to move away from these established responses. To do so might mean taking an unappealing-looking person and trying to imagine them as a young child, joyfully playing on their bedroom floor. We might try to picture their mother, not long after their birth, holding them in their arms, overcome by passionate love for this new little life. Or perhaps drunk and passed out, ignoring their desperate cries.\n\nWe might see a furious person in a restaurant violently complaining that the tomato sauce is on the wrong place on their plate, but imagine how unequipped they are to understand, let alone patiently explain their own needs to others, and how powerless they must feel in a world that has frustrated them to the core.\n\nThe more energy we expend on thinking like this, the more we stand to discover a very surprising truth: that we could potentially see the loveable aspects of pretty much anyone.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we should give up all criteria when searching for a partner. It\u2019s a way of saying that the nicest person will eventually require us to look at them with imagination as we try to negotiate around some of their gravely dispiriting facets.\n\nOf course, the traffic isn\u2019t all one way. We too are challenging to be around and therefore in need of a constantly imaginative tender gaze to rescue us from being dismissed as just another everyday monster or leper.",

      "content": "### Intimacy and closeness\n\nOne of the frequent and painful paradoxes of romantic life is that the more we get to know and love someone, the harder it can be to summon up any wish to sleep with them. Intimacy and closeness, far from fostering deeper sexual desire, can be the ingredients that destroy excitement, whereas having only recently met a person and not feeling too much for them can set up awkward yet compelling preconditions for wanting to take them to bed.\n\nThe conundrum is sometimes colloquially referred to as the \u2018Madonna/whore complex\u2019. It can sound offensive and reactionary phrased like this, as if the problem applied to only one gender and might condone or even promote the dynamic that it describes. Yet the phrase circles something significant, always contemporary and of relevance to every gender (it might, for heterosexual women, be known as the \u2018saint/brute complex\u2019).\n\nSigmund Freud first drew attention to our difficulties connecting love with desire in the essay \u2018On the Universal Tendency to Debasement in the Sphere of Love\u2019 (1912). Of many of his patients, he wrote: \u2018Where they love, they have no desire, and where they desire, they cannot love.\u2019\n\nIn seeking to explain the division, Freud pointed to two facts connected to our upbringing: first, in childhood, we are generally brought up by people we love deeply and yet towards whom we cannot express sexual feelings (dissuaded as we are by a strict incest taboo); second, as adults, we tend to choose lovers who in certain powerful (though unconscious) ways resemble those whom we loved most dearly as children.\n\nTogether, these influences set up a devilish conundrum whereby the more deeply we come to love someone outside of our family, the more strongly we are reminded of the intimacy of our early familial bonds, and hence the less free we instinctively are to express our sexual desires without fear or reservation. An incest taboo originally designed to limit the genetic dangers of inbreeding can thus inhibit and eventually ruin our chances of enjoying intercourse with someone to whom we are not related.\n\nThe likelihood of the incest taboo\u2019s re-emergence with a partner increases greatly after the arrival of children. Until then, reminders of the parental prototypes on which our choice of lovers is subconsciously based can just about be kept at bay. But once there is a pram in the hallway and a sweet infant referring to the person we once tied up or explored with a sex toy as \u2018Mummy\u2019 or \u2018Daddy\u2019, both parties may start to take fright, complain of feeling tired and turn in early.\n\nA dichotomy grows between the \u2018pure\u2019 things one can do with a partner one loves and the \u2018dirty\u2019 things one still longs to do but can only imagine being free enough to do with a near stranger. It can feel untenably disrespectful to want to make love to or (to put the matter at its sharpest) fuck the kind person who will later be preparing lunch boxes and arranging the school rota.\n\nTo overcome the problem, it pays to observe that not all childhoods are equal in their tendencies to generate sexual difficulties for people in later life. A parent who is uncomfortable with their body may send out covert signals that sex is dirty, bad and dangerous, and thereby give their child the impression that sex can\u2019t belong within a loving relationship. A more integrated and mature parent, on the other hand, may suggest that they are reconciled to their desires and relaxed about some of the proto-sexual things that small children naturally and innocently do: make a lot of noise and mess, take an interest in their bodies and (at a certain age) talk endlessly about poo.\n\nA lot of the work to repair the love/sex dichotomy can, strangely for something so physical, be done in the mind. We can conceptually start to rehabilitate sex as a serious and, in its way, respectable topic in which good people who love their children and their jobs and are invested in an upstanding life can be profoundly interested; that there need be no conflict between a longing to be filthy and depraved at some points and decorous and respectable at others. We can contain multitudes: the person who wants to flog or be debased and the person who wants to advise, nurture and counsel. One can be whore and Madonna, brute and saint. Rather than seeking out different partners, we might settle, less disruptively, on merely adopting different roles.\n\nA child cannot express love and sexuality to a parent, and vice versa. But it is one of the privileges of adulthood that we no longer have to be hampered by such paradigms. Our lovers need not be only cosy co-parents and responsible, sweet friends; they can also be something else that is important to our well-being and the survival of our relationships: partners in crime.",

      "content": "### Accepting ourselves sexually\n\nTheoretically, we live in sexually liberated times. Officially, modern societies have become open-minded about what consenting adults get up to in private. However, this has not removed the likelihood of being beset by profound feelings of shame. As individuals, we tend to remain grievously constrained about what we can admit to liking or wanting in bed. It is hard not to consider our true sexual appetites with embarrassment, and to be either very restricted or outright mute with our partners about who we really are in sexual terms. Rather than sex being the exciting, playful adventure we might have imagined, it often ends up a minefield of disappointment, compromise and caution.\n\nIronically, the main obstacle to accepting and then explaining the more complicated parts of our sexual nature to other people is that we don\u2019t have a reasonable or kindly view of it ourselves. We fear that others will find us weird or confusing because, secretly, that\u2019s how we appear to ourselves.\n\nThe sense that we need to hide, deny and bury away key elements of who we are is not good for us. When we repress things that are important, they make themselves heard in other ways. As psychoanalysis has revealed, the \u2018dirty\u2019 parts of ourselves can show up disguised as greed, harsh opinions, bad temper, the longing to boss other people about, alcoholism or other forms of risky, damaging behaviour. There is a high price for disavowing powerful parts of ourselves.\n\nThe core skill for a more properly liberated sexuality is a richer, more enlightened vision of what sexual desire actually aims at. It is easy to become disgusted with ourselves because our desires seem so opposed to our more caring or intelligent sides. But properly understood, the most apparently \u2018dirty\u2019 or peculiar practices reveal a logic that is far more connected than we might have imagined to our standard self-image and sense of dignity.\n\nFor example, if we want to be aggressive and forceful in sex and maybe handcuff a lover or whip them hard, we have not taken leave of our senses. This can be an exciting prospect because it carries with it the promise that our aggression may not always be destructive. It can be allied to an underlying feeling of love, and therefore suggests that we can unite our powerful and our tender sides in a single act. The fantasy is that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint; no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate and very real problem of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person. In the sexual game, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety \u2013 because one might be mistaken about another\u2019s wishes, because there might be resentment, because one might hurt someone \u2013 the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.\n\nOr suppose we want to be humiliated and shouted at in a sexual scenario. We may be turned on by the idea of passivity and submission as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. Being a \u2018slave\u2019 means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won\u2019t have our best interests at heart. They won\u2019t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission. But the deep hope in the erotic scenario is that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion.\n\nThe essence of sexual liberation should be mental.\n\nIt is a common feature of all sexual fantasies that they do not \u2013 of course \u2013 genuinely solve the problems from which they draw their excitement. But we shouldn\u2019t worry if the fantasy fails to solve the problem in reality. What we\u2019re looking for is simply a way of explaining and sympathising with a desire.\n\nOur sexual imagination can seem frightening at times when it advances scenarios that would be problematic in reality. But we already know how to juggle fantasy in other areas of our lives. For instance, we might enjoy reading a novel in which the central character is interrogated by the secret police; it\u2019s a thrilling episode in the book, although it would be traumatic to undergo such an ordeal in real life. The fact that we enjoy a chapter says little about our views on reality.\n\nSexual excitement is fairly easy to understand and not contrary to reason. It is continuous with many of the things we want in other areas. Although our erotic enthusiasms might sometimes sound odd or off-putting, they are motivated by a search for the good; a search for a life marked by understanding, sympathy, trust, unity, generosity and kindness. The things that turn us on are almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we\u2019d like things to be. The essence of sexual liberation should be mental: in our own heads we can properly articulate the legitimacy and sanity of our interests and excitements. And if we can first explain something calmly and clearly to ourselves, we have a much greater chance of being able subsequently to explain it to a lover.\n\nThe experience of erotic liberation does not depend on being able to locate a special person who understands us; it\u2019s to do with feeling that we can offer a proper explanation of ourselves to other people. They might or might not be interested in the things that interest us, but we\u2019re freed from caring so much about their approval because we already have approval from a source that matters much more: ourselves.",

      "content": "### An attractive mindset\n\nOur societies pay vast attention to the idea of \u2018sexiness\u2019. Far more questionably, they tempt us to believe that it might be easy to understand what this quality consists of. The leading suggestion takes its starting point from the biological sciences: we learn that sex aims at successful reproduction and genetic fitness in the coming generation. Therefore, \u2018sexiness\u2019 must logically comprise a host of semi-conscious signals of fertility and of resistance to disease: bilateral facial symmetry; large, bright pupils; full lips; youthful skin and thick hair.\n\nBut this analysis too quickly assumes that it might be simple to know what sex really aims at. Unlike most other living beings, our biological drives sit alongside, and at points take second place to, a range of emotional priorities. Chief among these is the desire to overcome loneliness and share our vulnerability within the arms of a safe and intimate other. We seek, through a physical act, to overcome our customary psychological alienation and a host of painful barriers to being known and accepted. Viewed through such a lens, the erotic is not so much a promise of reproductive health as a suggestion of a redemptive capacity for closeness, connection and understanding, and an end to shame and isolation.\n\nIt is this emotional mission that explains the conundrum sometimes generated by people whom one would expect, by standard biological criteria, to possess an exemplary sexual aura, but who leave us cold \u2013 just as it may shed light on the associated puzzle of those physically more challenged candidates who nevertheless have a rare power that far outstrips the quality of their hair or the lustre of their eyes.\n\nThe people whom we call \u2018sexy\u2019 despite, or aside from, the raw facts of their appearance are those whose features and manner suggest an unusual ability to fulfil the underlying emotional purpose of lovemaking. The way they respond to a joke, the curve of an eyebrow, the characteristic motion of their forehead, the way of holding their hands all convey that one is in the presence of a kindly being who may understand our broken and confused aspects. They may help us over our loneliness and submerged sadness and reassure us of our basic legitimacy and worth; they are someone with whom we can reduce our normal suspicions, cast aside our armour and feel safe, playful and accepted. Whatever the quality of their skin or balance of their proportions, it is these aspects that have a true power to excite us; in a melancholy and avoidant world, this is the real turn-on.\n\nWe hear so much about what we might need to do to increase our physical appeal. But by getting more detailed about the psychological traits that drive desire, we could learn to pay as much, if not more, attention to the foundations of an exciting mindset. Armed with a broader understanding of the aims of sexuality, some of the following might also deserve to be counted as valuable sources of sexiness.",

Yet, despite appearances, many of us don\u2019t manage to leave school at that point at all. In a deep part of our minds, we may still be there, deep into adulthood, not sitting in a classroom precisely, but in terms of how our minds work, as much stuck within the confines of a school-based worldview as if we were showing up for assembly every day.

There is a desire to please teachers and win prizes, cups and ribbons.\n\n\u2022 A sense that there is an implicit curriculum out there \u2013 an externally mandated map of what one needs to do to succeed \u2013 and that a wise person must dutifully subscribe to its demands.\n\n\u2022 A feeling that when it\u2019s going well, work should feel irksome, dull and somewhat pointless.

They subtly train us in intellectual masochism.\n\n\u2022 You\u2019re doing it for someone else; an audience; your teachers, your parents and their substitutes in adult life. Make us proud. You have to shine. We\u2019ve given you so much. What matters is the performance, not any inner sense of satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Authority is benign. They want what is good for you and they speak on behalf of your long-term interests. Don\u2019t think you could ever know better; distrust your instincts. We\u2019ll look after you. If you follow our rules, you will thrive.\n\n\u2022 The exam (and all its successors) are fundamentally accurate. Those who know have worked out the ultimate test of your value. You are what you score.\n\n\u2022 Every school is a miniature society, equipped with a strong sense of what values to revere and codes to follow. Bullies lurk, ready to mock and identify any departures from the norm. You can\u2019t escape them; they are next to you in class every day. They will spot and persecute the weirdos; they can ruin your life. You learn to cower and adjust your attitudes. Following the herd is paramount.\n\nThese ways of thinking don\u2019t require us to be sitting in a geography class. We might be in an office selling garden furniture to the Belgian market and thinking like this; we might have children of our own and by all appearances be an adult, yet still be living as though there were \u2018exams\u2019 to pass and cups to be won.\n\nWhat would it mean to break the mould? What would it mean finally to leave school? It would involve knowing some of the following:\n\n\u2022 There is no one way, no one set path to fulfilment laid out by authority figures. \u2018They\u2019 don\u2019t know. No one knows.\n\n\u2022 The safe path may be dangerous to our flourishing.\n\n\u2022 Our boredom is a vital tool. It tells us what is slowly killing us, and reminds us that time is monstrously short.\n\n\u2022 Authority is not by definition benign. The teachers and their substitutes have no real plan for you except in so far as it suits their own advancement. It might look as if they want your supreme good, but in reality they want you to play their game for their own benefit. At the end, they have no proper prize to offer you. They will give you a colourful card and send you to the golf course and the grave and you will have wasted your life.\n\n\u2022 It doesn\u2019t matter what the bullies think. No one is normal. You can dare to make enemies; indeed, you must do so as the price to pay for having developed a character and found something to believe in.\n\nWe should not be tough on ourselves for lingering so long. School is an immensely impressive system. We start there when we are not much bigger than a chair. For more than a decade, it is all we know. It is the outside world, and those who love us most tell us we should respect it. It speaks with immense authority not just about itself, but about life in general. It is sold to us as a preparation for the whole of existence. But the main thing it does is to prepare us for yet more school; it is an education in how to thrive within its own profoundly peculiar rules, with only a tenuous connection to the world beyond.\n\nKnowing all this, we might finally work up the courage to leave our inner school \u2013 be it at 28, 45 or 62 \u2013 and enter the wider, boundless world we have been in flight from for too long.",

      "content": "### Overcoming thepressure to be exceptional\n\nIt\u2019s a simple question that gets to the core of someone\u2019s sense of well-being and legitimacy: did your childhood leave you feeling that you were, on balance, OK as you were, or did you derive the impression that you needed to be extraordinary in order to deserve a place on Earth? To raise an associated question: are you now relaxed about your status, or else a manic overachiever \u2013 or filled with shame at your so-called mediocrity?\n\nAround one-fifth of us will be in the uncomfortable cohort, alternately refusing to believe that anything could ever be enough or cursing ourselves as \u2018failures\u2019 (by which we in essence mean that we have not managed to beat insane statistical odds). At school, we probably worked very hard, not because we were drawn to the topics, but because we felt compelled for reasons that were not clear at the time; we just knew we had to come close to the top of the class and revise every evening. We may not be exceptional right now, but we are seldom without an acute sense of pressure to be so.\n\nIn childhood, the story might have gone like this. A parent needed us to be special \u2013 by virtue of intelligence, looks or popularity \u2013 in order to shore up a floundering sense of their own self. The child needed to achieve and could not, therefore, just be; their own motives and tastes were not to be part of the picture. The parent was privately in pain, unable to value themselves, battling an unnamed depression, furious with the course of their own lives, perhaps covertly tortured by their spouse. The child\u2019s mission, for which there was no option but to volunteer, was to make it all better.\n\nIt seems odd to look at achievement through this lens \u2013 not as the thing the newspapers tell us it is, but very often as a species of mental illness. Those who put up the skyscrapers, write the bestselling books, perform on stage or make partner may in fact be the unwell ones. Conversely, the characters who, without agony, can bear an ordinary life, the so-called contented \u2018mediocrities\u2019, may be the emotional superstars, the aristocrats of the spirit, the captains of the heart. The world divides into the privileged who can be ordinary and the damned who are compelled to be remarkable.\n\nThe best possible outcome for the latter is to have a breakdown. Suddenly, after years of achievement, they can \u2013 if they are lucky \u2013 no longer get out of bed. They fall into a profound depression. They develop all-consuming social anxiety. They refuse to eat. They babble incoherently. They in some way poke a very large stick in the wheels of day-to-day life and are allowed to stay home for a while. A breakdown is not merely a random piece of madness or malfunction, it can be a very real \u2013 albeit inarticulate and inconvenient \u2013 bid for health. It is an attempt by one part of our minds to force the other into a process of growth, self-understanding and self-development that it has hitherto been too cowed to undertake. If we can put it paradoxically, it is an attempt to jump-start a process of getting well \u2013 properly well \u2013 through a stage of falling very ill.\n\nIn an apparently ill state, we might cleverly be seeking to destroy all the building blocks of our previous driven yet unhappy careers. We may be trying to reduce our commitments and our outgoings. We may be trying to throw off the cruelty of others\u2019 expectations.\n\nOur societies \u2013 which are often unwell at a collective and not just an individual level \u2013 are predictably lacking in inspiring images of good-enough ordinary lives. They tend to associate these with being a loser. We imagine that a quiet life is something that only a failed person without options would ever seek. We relentlessly identify goodness with being at the centre, in the metropolis, on the stage. We don\u2019t like autumn mellowness or the peace that comes once we are past the meridian of our hopes. But there is, of course, no centre; or rather, the centre is oneself.\n\nOccasionally an artist will bring such bathetic wisdom home. Here is the French writer and philosopher Michel de Montaigne (1533\u20131592), capturing the point in the third volume of his Essays, written a few years before his death:\n\n\u2018Storming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household \u2013 and with yourself \u2013 not getting slack nor belying yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.\u2019\n\nIn the late 1650s, the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632\u20131675) painted a picture called The Little Street which continues to challenge our value system to this day.\n\nJohannes Vermeer, The Little Street, c. 1657\u20131658\n\nSuccess might in fact be nothing more than a quiet afternoon with the children, at home, in a modest street. A similar point is made in certain stories by Chekhov or Raymond Carver; in Bob Dylan\u2019s Time Out of Mind; in the films of Eric Rohmer, in particular Le Rayon Vert (1982); and in Thomas Jones\u2019s study of A Wall in Naples (1782).\n\nThomas Jones, A Wall in Naples, c. 1782\n\nMost movies, adverts, songs and articles, however, do not tend to go this way. They continually explain to us the appeal of sports cars, tropical islands, fame, an exalted destiny, first-class air travel and being very busy. The attractions are sometimes perfectly real, but the cumulative effect is to instil in us the idea that our own lives must be close to worthless.\n\nHowever, there may be immense skill, joy and nobility involved in what we are up to: in bringing up a child to be fairly independent and balanced; in maintaining a good-enough relationship with a partner over many years despite areas of extreme difficulty; in keeping a home in reasonable order; in getting a lot of early nights; in doing a not very exciting or well-paid job responsibly and cheerfully; in listening properly to other people; and, in general, in not succumbing to madness or rage at the paradox and compromises involved in being alive.\n\nThere is already a treasury to appreciate in our circumstances when we learn to see these without prejudice or self-hatred. As we may discover once we are beyond others\u2019 expectations, life\u2019s true luxuries might comprise nothing more or less than simplicity, quiet friendship based on vulnerability, creativity without an audience, love without too much hope or despair, hot baths and dried fruits, walnuts and the odd sliver of very dark chocolate.",

      "content": "### The hard work of laziness\n\nAt times, perhaps without knowing why, we slip into a resolutely \u2018lazy\u2019 mood. We\u2019re simply not able to write anything new or we can\u2019t face setting up more meetings. We don\u2019t want to clean the fridge or go out to befriend prospective clients. All we have an appetite for, it seems, is to loll on the sofa and maybe dip randomly into a book, wander down to the shops and buy a packet of biscuits, or spend an hour or so soaking in the bath. We might, at an extreme, merely want to sit by the window and stare at the clouds. For a long time.\n\nIn such states of mind, we\u2019re liable to be stigmatised as \u2018lazy\u2019 by friends or \u2013 more painfully \u2013 by our own conscience. Laziness feels like a sin against the bustling activity of modernity; it seems to bar us from living successfully or from thinking well of ourselves. But, to consider the matter from another perspective, it might be that the real threat to our happiness and self-development lies not in our failure to be busy, but in the opposite scenario: in our inability to be \u2018lazy\u2019 enough.\n\nOutwardly idling does not have to mean that we are neglecting to be fruitful. It may look to the world as if we are accomplishing nothing, but, below the surface, a lot may be going on that is both important and, in its own way, very arduous. When we are busy with routines and administration, we are focused on the elements that sit at the front of our minds: we are executing plans rather than reflecting on their value and ultimate purpose. But it is to the deeper, less accessible zones of our inner lives that we have to turn in order to understand the foundations of our problems and arrive at decisions and conclusions that can govern our overall path. Yet these only emerge \u2013 shyly and tentatively \u2013 when we are brave enough to distance ourselves from immediate demands; when we can stare at clouds and do so-called nothing at all.\n\nWe need to distinguish between emotional and practical hard work. Someone who looks active, whose diary is filled from morning till night, who is always running to answer messages and meet clients, may appear the opposite of lazy. But, secretly, there may be a lot of avoidance going on beneath the outward frenzy. Busy people evade a different order of undertaking. They are always active, yet don\u2019t get round to working out their real feelings about their work. They constantly delay the investigation of their own direction. They are lazy when it comes to understanding particular emotions about a partner or friend. They go to every conference, but don\u2019t get around to thinking about what their status means to them.\n\nWe need to distinguish between emotional and practical hard work.\n\nThey regularly catch up with colleagues, but don\u2019t consider what the point of money might be. Their busyness is a subtle but powerful form of distraction.\n\nOur minds are, in general, a great deal readier to execute than to reflect. They can be rendered uncomfortable by so-called large questions: What am I really trying to do? What do I actually enjoy and who am I trying to please? How would I feel if what I\u2019m currently doing comes right? What will I regret in a decade\u2019s time? By contrast, the easy bit can be the running around, the never pausing to ask why, the repeatedly ensuring that there isn\u2019t a moment to have doubts or feel sad or searching. Busyness can mask a vicious form of laziness.\n\nOur lives might be a lot more balanced if we learnt to reallocate prestige, pulling it away from those with a full diary and towards those wise enough to allow for long afternoons of reflection. We should think that there is courage not just in travelling the world, but also in daring to sit at home with one\u2019s thoughts for a while, risking encounters with certain anxiety-inducing or melancholy but also necessary ideas. Without the shield of busyness, we might bump into the realisation that our relationship has reached an impasse, that our work no longer answers to any higher purpose or that we feel furious with a family member who is subtly exploiting our patience. The heroically hard worker isn\u2019t necessarily the one in the business lounge of the international airport; it might be the person gazing without expression out of the window and occasionally writing down one or two ideas on a pad of paper.\n\nThe point of \u2018doing nothing\u2019 is to clean up our inner lives. There is so much that happens to us every day, so many excitements, regrets, suggestions and emotions that we should, if we are living consciously, spend at least an hour a day processing. Most of us manage a few minutes at best and thereby let the marrow of life escape us. We do so not because we are forgetful or bad, but because our societies protect us from our responsibilities to ourselves through their cult of activity. We are granted every excuse not to undertake the truly difficult labour of leading more conscious, more searching and more intensely felt lives.\n\nThe next time we feel lazy, we should imagine that a deep part of us is preparing to give birth to a big thought. As with a pregnancy, there is no point hurrying the process. We need to lie still and let the idea gestate, sure that it may eventually prove its worth. We may need to risk being accused of gross laziness in order one day to put in motion projects and initiatives we can feel proud of.",

      "content": "### Learning to listen to your boredom\n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of small children is their militant aversion to boredom. With ruthless determination, they embark on one occupation after another, shifting their focus whenever an even marginally more attractive prospect comes into view. An average morning might involve taking out eight board games from the cupboard, then, just as it seemed it might be time for Snakes and Ladders, experimenting with turning the sofa into a ski slope, then trying to pull a toy rabbit\u2019s tail off, followed by exploring what happens to the chocolate biscuits when one pounds them with a hammer, before finally tipping up all the kitchen chairs and pretending they are ships engaged in a sea battle.\n\nWhat we call education is in large measure an attempt to bring order to this chaos; to teach the child to ignore the welter of their own spontaneous enthusiasms and instead to learn to sit with their boredom for a while in the name of getting something substantial done: listening to a lengthy speech about kindness by the head teacher without screaming; enduring a forty-five-minute maths lesson without getting up to dance; resisting the temptation to draw an imaginary world during an introductory French class. Becoming that most prized of things, a \u2018good child\u2019, means mastering the art of suppressing one\u2019s own boredom in the name of growing up.\n\nThe rationale for this pedagogical move is both solid and noble. There is clearly a great deal to be gained from not running away the moment a new fancy enters one\u2019s mind. Yet the problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re generally blind to this logic, but that we\u2019re far too good at submitting to it. Most of us grow fatefully proficient at bearing our own boredom.\n\nAlong the way, we forget that boredom has many important things to teach us. It is, at its best, a confused, inarticulate but genuine signal from a deep part of our minds that something is wrong. We may not know what, but the sensation of being bored frequently contains (especially for otherwise sensible adults) an apprehension of genuine danger. There are boring books that should be tossed aside. There are boring people we should refuse to see. There are boring films we should walk out of. And what should sharpen our courage to do so is an ongoing awareness that the fundamental currency of our lives is time, of which we are in desperately short supply, there being on average no more than 26,000 days or so in an entire existence on the planet.\n\nThe American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803\u20131882) once remarked: \u2018In the minds of geniuses, we find \u2013 once more \u2013 our own neglected thoughts.\u2019 This implies that most of us become mediocre not because we have failed to submit ourselves rigorously enough to the world\u2019s knowledge, but because we have grown too good at ignoring our inborn ideas and impulses. We have smothered our feelings of excitement and boredom for the sake of obedience to grand authorities and have paid a heavy price for our politeness. The people we call geniuses are, from this perspective, not in possession of any form of esoteric wisdom; they are simply unusually faithful towards aspects of their inner lives. They are those who have managed to hold on to things that the rest of us surrender out of an exaggerated fear of being weird or wilful.\n\nListening to our boredom has the chance to tug us back to our true concerns. We realise what our tastes in literature really are; what sort of entertainment we actually prefer; what properly enthuses us about other people. Boredom functions as the scalpel with which we can cut off all that is \u2018dead\u2019 and extraneous about our lives. The courage to admit to our boredom allows us, gradually, to develop a personality. Boredom is the inarticulate voice of a fundamental idea: that something has been oversold to us and needs to be discounted.\n\nIt is telling that, as they get older, many artists instinctively get better at listening to their boredom, and produce greatly superior work as a result. Critics commonly refer to this as a \u2018late style\u2019, marked by impatience, brevity, courage and intensity. One thinks of Bach\u2019s exceptional later choral works, the final short stories of Chekhov or the sublime paper cut-outs of the dying Matisse.\n\nPoignantly, an ageing Picasso, on a tour of a primary school, once remarked: \u2018It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.\u2019 What he meant was that it had taken him decades to shake off a compliant urge to paint \u2018well\u2019 and \u2018respectably\u2019 and to listen more closely to his own sense of fun (a serious business, not to be confused with its lesser sibling, frivolity). Pushed by mortality into a new respect for his own centres of pleasure, Picasso learnt how to overcome every trace of the mannered approach of his youth in order to focus on the joy of decorating a canvas with the loose brushstrokes, exuberance and bold colours well known to those natural artistic masters: five-year-old children.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be a towering figure of 20th-century art for the point to apply. All of us need to learn to develop a \u2018late style\u2019, and ideally as early on in our lives as possible. This is a way of being wherein we shake off the dead hand of habit and social fear and relearn to listen to what entertains us (and so we can stand the best chance of properly pleasing others too).\n\nPablo Picasso, Academic Study, 1895(Made when he was 14.)\n\nPablo Picasso, The Pigeons, 1957 (Made when he was 76.)Here is an artist who has remembered to listen to their boredom.\n\nThe results should apply not to works of art in a museum, but to aspects of our intimate lives: to the way we choose a career, host a dinner party, go on a holiday, have sex, tell an anecdote or act around our friends. Here too lie multiple opportunities to cut to the chase, to say what really matters and to express what we truly feel and want, while we yawn politely but defiantly at all that is slowly killing us.\n\nListening to our boredom has the chance to tug us back to our true concerns.",

      "content": "### Getting more serious about pleasure\n\nWhen it comes to work, we tend to be strategic and thorough in our approach. We think extensively about where our talents and opportunities lie; we spend years (and a fortune) on training; we devote extraordinary energy (and our most vigorous decades) to progressing up the ladder and we keep a vigilant and jealous eye on the progress of our rivals.\n\nBy contrast, our leisure hours promise to be easier. We don\u2019t expect there to be much complexity in this section of existence. We want to relax and have fun, and we tend to envisage that the only obstacles to such goals might be time and money. We adopt a welcoming, unsuspicious manner and readily take up others\u2019 suggestions without gimlet-eyed scrutiny. Sometimes, without thinking about it too much, we end up in a water park or at an aquarium or hosting a barbecue.\n\nWhat we may miss for many years is the real price of our negligence. We forget that our lives are so much less than they might be because we insist on being haphazard where we might be devotedly analytical. We stick to being guided by hearsay and muddled instinct when we should harness reason and independent reflection; we are a lot more miserable than we might be because we cannot take our own fun more seriously. And we don\u2019t because we are touchingly but ruinously lacking in vigilance about our individuality. We assume that what will work for others will work for us too. It doesn\u2019t readily occur to us to take our uniqueness into account.\n\nA corrective to this costly absence of mind comes from an unexpected quarter: the history of art. What we call a great artist is someone who has learnt to take their pleasure seriously. Most young artists don\u2019t. They like art, of course, but they don\u2019t drill too deeply into what they in particular, as unique beings with a highly individual history, sensory system and temperament, are inclined to like. That is why the chief characteristic of inexperienced artists is derivativeness. Their art reflects what everyone else around them tends to like and make in their particular era and circle. It\u2019s the art of people without a capacity to take their own pleasure seriously.\n\nConsider, for example, the career of the Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (1901\u20131966). Born in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden, he attended the Geneva School of Fine Arts, and his early work reflects the dominant influences of the times: the work of the Italian artist Giovanni Segantini and of the Impressionist school, especially \u00c9douard Manet and Henri Fantin-Latour. One thinks of Giacometti\u2019s paintings of the Swiss lakes and the surrounding mountains, or of his portraits of family members, such as his sister Ottilia. There is pleasure here, for sure, but not a pleasure with any deep roots in the personality of the creator.\n\nAlberto Giacometti, View on the Sils Lake Towards Piz Lizun, 1920\n\nAlberto Giacometti, Ottilia, c. 1920\n\nThen, in his early twenties, Giacometti left Switzerland for Paris. He broke with his family, thought very hard about who he really was and eventually re-emerged as the great artist we know today: the maker of unique, haunting, elongated figures that speak to us of a longing and a loneliness we may never have been able to identify in ourselves so clearly.\n\nAlberto Giacometti, Walking Man I, 1960\n\nTo become an artist in this sense is not about technical discovery; it\u2019s about the strength to discover and then stay faithful to one\u2019s self.\n\nMost of us are not making art. But we are involved in the business of getting to know and please ourselves, as any artist must. For too much of life, we assume that we may be like everyone else. Only gradually, if we are lucky, do we come to see that our characteristic way of drawing pleasure \u2013 from nature, books, films, dinner parties, clothes, travels, gardening \u2013 bears the imprint and distinctive timbre of our own individuality. To lean on an associated example, we learn how to become proper fetishists. The sexual fetishist is to the ordinary lover like the established artist to the novice: they are someone who has worked out what they really like, and how to hold on to it with rare fidelity and tenacity. While most of us go along with general suggestions of what good sex might consist of, the fetishist discerns their own proclivities. They realise that they might like a particular kind of floral material or a leather watch strap; the sound of water or the feel of a gold chain; a pair of socks or a black monogrammed briefcase. The fetishist is akin to the artist in having the stubborn presence of mind to defend their own tastes, even when these depart from the mainstream.\n\nOne thinks in this regard of the modernist architect Le Corbusier\u2019s attachment to including ramps in his buildings, whatever the design challenges or his clients\u2019 objections, or of a lover who dares to ask their partner to put on a pair of ankle-length white athletic socks before entering the bedroom. Great fetishists, like great artists, know the power of details to generate happiness.\n\nLe Corbusier, Villa Savoye, 1928\u20131931The power of details can make us happy.\n\nBy contrast, most of us are fatefully modest about what we enjoy. We don\u2019t dare to foreground our own discoveries. What we do with our leisure hours is therefore marked by a dispiriting uniformity. We go skiing because we hear so often that it\u2019s meant to be fun. We invite guests around for dinner and talk about what everyone else talks about and have melon for a starter because that\u2019s what one is meant to do. Our weekends unfold a bit like those of all our colleagues. We die with our particular appetites and intense sensations tragically unexplored.\n\nTo save ourselves, we need the equivalent of an artistic breakthrough. We should be prepared to be redemptively weird across the board in our leisure pursuits. If we were to use only ourselves as our lodestar and point of reference, what would a dinner party look like? What would we eat? What would we talk about? Where would we sit? What have we \u2013 the \u2018we\u2019 that will be dead in a few decades \u2013 enjoyed in the past and what might we recreate going forward? What might a holiday specifically geared to our tastes and proclivities be like? What bit of the standard tourist itinerary might we ditch? Which of our hitherto stray or guilty pleasures might we dare to bring into focus and anchor our days around? What might we learn to say no to and, in contrast, to emphasise going forward?\n\nIt is so often drummed into us that we may be selfish and should learn to relinquish our interests for the sake of the community that we fail to notice an even more horrific possibility: that in many areas, we\u2019re not selfish enough. We fail to pay appropriate attention to our fragile, extraordinary and scarce natures. We don\u2019t give outward expression to our true sensations. We don\u2019t give our weekends and our spare time the imprint of our own characters. We kill our uniqueness out of politeness and a fear of being odd. We spend far too much of our brief lives defending an impossible idea: that we are pretty much like anyone else.",

      "content": "### A more spontaneous life\n\nOne explanation for the low-level sadness that often dogs our spirits is a lack of spontaneity. Without necessarily being aware of the affliction, we can suffer from an excess of orderliness, caution and rigidity; we know pretty much exactly what we\u2019ll be doing a year from now; we rarely make a move without having planned it in detail; we seldom go anywhere new on the spur of the moment. Our limbs are tight, our words are measured, our interactions prescribed. Everything is under close surveillance, but not especially satisfying. We haven\u2019t danced in a long while.\n\nSo what might a more spontaneous life be like? It would be one in which we were able to act with less inhibition and fear in accordance with our true beliefs and values. Around friends, we might, in a rush of unfettered emotion, but without anything romantic being meant by it, tell someone that we love and admire them very much. Or, when upset by someone, we might allow ourselves to communicate hurt and disappointment directly. In company, we could feel free to outline what we actually thought about a political matter hedged in by groupthink. In bed, we might share one of our more intense and seldom-mentioned fantasies. In our work, we might embark on a bold and potentially life-changing initiative far sooner than we had imagined. In our leisure time, we might start writing a collection of recipes or poems, or else book a flight at the last minute and end up in a country we have never been to before, on an itinerary that we had made up only that morning.\n\nThe opposite of spontaneity is rigidity, an inability to allow too many of our own emotions into consciousness, and a corresponding reliance on hard work, manners and precise timetabling to prevent intimacy with the confusing, intense and unpredictable raw material of life itself. We are rigid because we are afraid. We stay rooted to our familiar spot because any movement is experienced as intensely dangerous. We ruminate excessively as a way of trying to exert control over a chaotic environment through our own thoughts. We seldom act, out of dread of making a terrible mistake.\n\nSpontaneity is almost always something that we have lost, rather than (mysteriously) failed to learn. It is a potential within all of us at birth, but it can be stripped from our characters. If we were to imagine a cruel experiment designed to rid someone of their capacity for spontaneity, one would probably need, at the age of one and a half or so, to frighten them rather a lot (be it over a wish to ruffle an adult\u2019s hair, explore a cupboard or sob uncontrollably). One would have to make the child feel that their emotions were too much to bear or illegal. One would shame them for any signs of exuberance or playfulness. And one might model for them behaviour marked by panic whenever something new appeared on the horizon: an unexpected ring at the door would be a crisis; a holiday a succession of possible catastrophes.\n\nIt is in the nature of our psychology that a pattern developed in relation to one particular set of circumstances in childhood becomes a feature of adult character, until and unless we remember and understand its dynamics. In other words, we\u2019ll continue not to be spontaneous until we can grasp how and why being so came to feel dangerous. The English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott spoke of a healthy upbringing being one in which a child was able to express their True Self without too much need, at first, for the compliance and hypocrisy of a False Self. Only when this True Self has had a chance to have its day can a person bear to submit to the demands of the world without too much loss of creativity or initiative. We need \u2013 with some urgency \u2013 to work out what happened to our True Self.\n\nWe should recognise along the way that many of our inhibitions are no longer warranted by the wide-open adult world; that whatever terrors we laboured under as children, we can afford now to relax our muscles, let our limbs hang more loosely from us and take a few risks to express our sexuality, our politics, our enthusiasms and our distastes. We might tell a friend we like them very much indeed; we might get stern with someone who keeps taking advantage of us; we might dare to make a move without a requirement to remove every last vestige of risk. We have for too long been clenched into place as if waiting for a blow that belongs to the past, not the future.\n\nWere we to admire the work of the artist Francis Bacon (1909\u20131992), it might in part be because it seems to contain a small morality tale about spontaneity. Bacon\u2019s canvases were, in their general layout, rigid and coolly formal, made up of sombre colours, symmetrical lines and stark perspectives. But in the middle of this austerity, Bacon typically allowed for a great deal of haphazardness and accident. He introduced figures composed with utmost serendipity, by throwing paint, and sometimes sponges, at the canvas, by pressing his brushes into swirling shapes in a frenzy of calculated disorder.\n\nWe might need to do a version of Bacon\u2019s experiments in our own lives: to prepare areas of great order and logic, but then allow for moments when we relax the shackles, safe in the knowledge that not everything is at stake and that the rewards may be decisive. We can throw paint and see how it lands; pay someone a compliment and see what happens; go to another country and be confident of somehow finding a bed for the night; turn our lives a little upside down and trust that they will be interesting at the very least. It may once have felt safe to avoid any risk, but the real risk today is to lead the remainder of our lives without ever giving expression to the spontaneous True Self, hiding inside its cage, terrified and clenched. We can at last (discreetly enough so that no one notices at first) try to dance a little.\n\nFrancis Bacon, Turning Figure, 1962",

      "content": "### Small luxuries\n\nAlthough it often \u2013 and sometimes fairly \u2013 gets confused with status seeking and showing off, at its best, luxury represents a concerted effort by one set of humans to provide carefully thought-out pleasure to another. It is, in the material realm, akin to the work of love.\n\nLuxury arises from the attempt to answer the question: if we didn\u2019t have to keep costs down, what would be the nicest, kindest and most generous possible version of something \u2013 a hotel, villa, car, restaurant or airline seat? Of course, this also means that, most of the time, major luxuries are unaffordable.\n\nBut what we too often forget, especially on our sadder, more restricted days, is that the core pleasures of luxury also exist in small forms that can be accessed at a far more manageable cost by pretty much anyone at any time. In certain categories, we can all have the privileges open to monarchs and potentates. We can walk into a fancy bakery and treat ourselves to the very finest brioche roll, wrapped for us with care by a dedicated and proud assistant. We can, when it comes to fruit juice, show maximal decadence and financial heedlessness.\n\nThe best way to identify the most suitable micro-luxuries lies in analysing what really appeals to us in the grand ones. For instance, if we think about a fabulous watch, it may turn out that \u2013 for us \u2013 a central attraction is the beautifully precise engineering of its springs and cogs. Once we have this in mind, we may find that a related and comparable pleasure is available to us when we purchase a high-quality, double-lever corkscrew. At a vastly more modest price point, it too has been superbly designed: its toothed wheels elegantly transform the downward pressure of our hands into an upward thrust; the action is smooth and reassuringly solid. We\u2019re accessing the same pleasure zone from an unexpected angle.\n\nSimilarly, the world\u2019s loveliest cars may be out of our reach, but we could quite easily purchase a box of some of the best pencils in the world. The pencil manufacturers have the same fundamental ambition as the car designers: to take a practical object and make it as pleasurable to use as possible. They have considered what kind of wood is best for sharpening; what surface texture gives the firmest grip; what the ideal weight and balance should be; and what lead gives the most satisfying line. They have aimed at perfection, and the resulting product does not need an exorbitant price tag. We can, on a very modest salary, buy the best pencil available.\n\nThe facade of a French chateau on the market for multiple millions may delight us with its refined proportions, but we can buy an equally refined plate and eat a slice of toast off it each morning. One thing that may appeal about a famous hotel is the attentive, discreet service. We can\u2019t spend a fortnight in a suite, but we could occasionally have a cocktail in the bar, mixed and served with polite panache.\n\nLuxury exists around all kinds of objects. There are exceptional Old Master paintings, but there is also exceptional olive oil. Someone else might have a bespoke cashmere coat, but we might have a pair of silk socks. In terms of escalating costs, the high point of socks is reached much sooner than the high point in coats. The world\u2019s best bread is within our grasp; the world\u2019s best caviar may not be.\n\nWe misunderstand luxury when we see it as the self-indulgence of the rich or as the stroking of the egos of those who already have inflated views of their own worth. Luxury objects have a power to reassure us and make us feel, for a time, loved and appreciated, and they are often needed precisely because we feel crushed by existence. Luxury can matter because, in other areas of our lives, much has gone wrong, for reasons too complex to correct in any brief timescale. Our child may no longer look up when we greet them at breakfast; our spouse may be filled with resentments; our work may leave us in no doubt as to our idiocy and foolishness.\n\nBut, with one loaf of sourdough bread from an artisanal bakery or a tiny bottle of lavender bath oil from a shop in Provence, we have \u2013 for a little while \u2013 a kind of compensation for our woes. We are in the presence of something truly delightful; a portion of the kindness and consideration we crave, but hardly ever receive and may not quite deserve. Money obviously cannot buy us everything we truly want, especially the warm regard of those we love. But it can put us in contact with a few symbols of consideration and tenderness, which might be the very best we can hope for, and that is realistically available to us, in the radically imperfect circumstances of our lives. We may not always have the inner resources to find luxury uninteresting, but fortunately, in very minor doses, it is continually and surprisingly available to us as a source of consolation and uplift.",

      "content": "### Learning to be more selfish\n\nFrom a young age, we are taught that one of the greatest risks to our integrity and flourishing is our own selfishness. Wherever possible, we must learn to think more of other people, keep in mind how often we fail to see things from their point of view, and be aware of the small and large ways in which we disadvantage and ignore collective interests. Being good means, at its most basic, putting other people more squarely at the centre of our lives.\n\nBut for some of us, the problem isn\u2019t so much that we are heedless to this advice, but that we take it too much to heart. So mindful are we of the risks of selfishness that we run into an opposite danger: an abnegation of the self; a modesty that borders on self-erasure; a shyness about pressing oneself forward and a manic inability to say \u2018no\u2019 or cause the slightest frustration to others.\n\nAs a result of our talent at \u2018selflessness\u2019, we fill our diaries with obligations to people who bore and drain us, we stick at jobs that neglect our true talents and we stay for far too long in relationships with people who deceive us, annoy us or take us for a ride. Then, one morning, we wake up and find that the bulk of our life is already behind us, that our best years are spent and that no one is especially grateful for our sacrifices, that there isn\u2019t a reward in heaven for our renunciations and that we are furious with ourselves for mistaking meekness and self-surrender for kindness.\n\nThe priority may then be to rediscover our latent reserves of selfishness. The very word may be frightening, because we aren\u2019t taught to distinguish between the bad and good versions of this trait. On the one hand, there is the kind of selfishness that viciously exploits and reduces others; that operates with no higher end in view; that disregards people out of meanness and negligence. On the other, there is the kind of selfishness that we require to get anything substantial done; that lends us the courage to prioritise our own concerns over the flotsam and jetsam of daily life; and that lends us the spirit to be more forthright about our interests with people who claim to love us. This type of selfishness can lead us to sidestep nagging demands, not in order to make people suffer, but so that we can husband our resources and, in time, be able to serve the world in the best way we can.\n\nWith a more fruitfully selfish philosophy in mind, we might fight to have an hour to ourselves each day. We may do something that could get us labelled as \u2018self-indulgent\u2019 (having psychotherapy three times a week, or writing a book), but that is vital to our spirit. We might go on a trip on our own, because so much has happened that we need to process in silence. We cannot be good to anyone else until we have serviced some of our own inner callings. A lack of selfishness may be the fastest route to turning us into ineffective, embittered and ultimately disagreeable people.\n\nHindu philosophy can be a useful guide here: it divides our lives into four stages, each with its distinctive roles and responsibilities. The first is that of the bachelor student (known as Brahmacharya); the second that of the householder and parent (Grihastha); and the third that of the grandparent and semi-retired advisor (Vanaprastha). But it\u2019s the fourth that is the really interesting age in this context: known as Sannyasa, this is the time when \u2013 after years of service to other people, to business, family and society \u2013 we finally throw off our worldly obligations and focus instead on the development of our psychological and spiritual sides. We might sell up our house, go travelling and wander the world to learn, talk to strangers, open our eyes and nourish our minds. In the period of Sannyasa, we live simply (perhaps by a beach or on the side of a mountain); we eat basic food and have few belongings; we cut our ties with everyone who has nothing spirit-related to tell us; anyone who is on the make and in too much of a hurry; anyone who doesn\u2019t spend a substantial amount of their time reflecting on the meaning of being alive.\n\nWhat feels insightful about this division of existence is that it acknowledges that a Sannyasa way of living can\u2019t be right for everyone at any time, yet, on the same score, that no good life can be complete without a version of it. There are years when we simply have to keep our heads down and study; years when we have to bring up children and accumulate some capital. But there are also, just as importantly, years when what we need to do above all is say \u2018enough\u2019 \u2013 enough to material and superficial demands; enough to sexual and romantic entanglements; enough to status and sociability \u2013 and instead turn our minds inwards and upwards.\n\nWithout having to don the orange robe favoured by Hindu Sannyasas, with perhaps few visible signs of our reorientation to speak of, it is open to all of us to make a psychological move into a more self-focused and inner age. We can convey to those around us that we aren\u2019t lazy, mad or callous; we just need to avoid doing the expected things for a while. We need to fulfil our real promise by casting aside an idea that is only ever superficially wise: putting other people first.\n\nWe cannot be good to anyone else until we have serviced some of our own inner callings.",

      "content": "### How to lengthen your life\n\nThe normal way we set about trying to extend our lives is by striving to add more years to them \u2013 maybe by eating more quinoa and broccoli, going to bed early and running in the rain. But this approach may turn out to be quixotic, not only because Death can\u2019t reliably be warded off with kale, but at a deeper level, because the best way to lengthen a life is not by attempting to stick more years onto its tail.\n\nOne of the most basic facts about time is that, even though we insist on measuring it as if it were an objective unit, it doesn\u2019t, in all conditions, feel as if it were moving at the same pace. Five minutes can feel like an hour; ten hours can feel like five minutes. A decade may pass like two years; two years may acquire the weight of half a century.\n\nIn other words, our subjective experience of time bears little relation to the way we like to measure it on a clock. Time moves more or less slowly according to the vagaries of the human mind: it may fly or it may drag. It may evaporate into airy nothing or achieve enduring density.\n\nIf the goal is to have a longer life, whatever the dieticians may urge, it seems like the priority should not be to add raw increments of time, but to ensure that whatever years remain feel appropriately substantial. The aim should be to densify time rather than to try to extract one or two more years from the grip of Death.\n\nWhy then does time have such different speeds, moving at certain points bewilderingly fast, at others with intricate moderation? The clue is to be found in childhood. The first ten years almost invariably feel longer than any other decade we have on Earth. The teens are a little faster but still crawl. Yet by our 40s, time will have started to trot; by our 60s, it will be unfolding at a bewildering gallop.\n\nThe difference in pace is not mysterious; it has to do with novelty. The more our days are filled with new, unpredictable and challenging experiences, the longer they will feel. Conversely, the more one day is exactly like another, the faster it will pass by in a blur. Childhood ends up feeling so long because it is the cauldron of novelty. Its most ordinary days are packed with extraordinary discoveries and sensations: these can be as apparently minor yet as significant as the first time we explore the zip on a cardigan or hold our nose underwater; the first time we look at the sun through the cotton of a beach towel or dig our fingers into the putty holding a window in its frame. Dense as it is with stimuli, the first decade can feel a thousand years long.\n\nChildhood ends up feeling so long because it is the cauldron of novelty.\n\nBy middle age, things can be counted upon to have grown a lot more familiar. We may have flown around the world a few times. We no longer get excited by the idea of eating a pineapple, owning a car or flipping a light switch. We know about relationships, earning money and telling others what to do. As a result, time runs away from us without mercy.\n\nOne solution often suggested is that we should put all our efforts into discovering fresh sources of novelty. We need to become explorers and adventurers. We must go to Machu Picchu or Angkor Wat, Astana or Montevideo; we need to find a way to swim with dolphins or order a thirteen-course meal at a world-famous restaurant in downtown Lima. That will finally slow down the cruel gallop of time.\n\nHowever, this is to labour under an unfair, expensive and ultimately impractical notion of novelty: that it must involve seeing new things when it should really involve seeing familiar things with new eyes. By middle age we may have seen a great many things in our neighbourhoods, but we are unlikely to have properly noticed most of them. We have probably taken a few cursory glances at the miracles of existence that lie to hand and assumed, quite unjustly, that we know all there is to know about them. We\u2019ve imagined we understand the city we live in, the people we interact with and, more or less, the point of it all.\n\nOf course, we have barely scratched the surface. We have grown bored of a world we haven\u2019t begun to study properly. And that, among other things, is why time is racing by.\n\nThe pioneers at making life feel longer in the way that counts are not dieticians, but artists. At its best, art is a tool that reminds us of how little we have fathomed and noticed. It reintroduces us to ordinary things and reopens our eyes to a latent beauty and interest in precisely those areas we had ceased to bother with. It helps us to recover some of the manic sensitivity we had as newborns. Opposite is the French artist Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839\u20131906), looking closely at apples, as if he had never seen one before, and below him is Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528), looking very closely at a clod of earth, as only children usually do.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to make art in order to learn the most valuable lesson of artists, which is about noticing properly, living with our eyes open \u2013 and thereby savouring time. Without any intention to create something that could be put in a gallery, we could, as part of a goal of living more deliberately, take a walk in an unfamiliar part of town; ask an old friend about a side of their life we\u2019d never dared to probe at; lie on our back in the garden and look up at the stars; or hold our partner in a way we never tried before. It takes a rabid lack of imagination to think we have to go to Machu Picchu to find something new to perceive.\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne, Apples, c. 1878\u20131879\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, The Great Piece of Turf, 1503\n\nIn Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s novel The Idiot (1869), a prisoner has suddenly been condemned to death and been told he has only a few minutes left to live. \u2018What if I were not to die!\u2019 he exclaims. \u2018What if life were given back to me \u2013 what infinity! \u2026 I\u2019d turn a whole minute into an age \u2026\u2019 Faced with losing his life, the poor wretch recognises that every minute could be turned into aeons of time, with sufficient imagination and appreciation.\n\nIt is sensible enough to try to live longer lives. But we are working with a false notion of what long really means. We might live to be a thousand years old and still complain that it had all rushed by too fast. We should be aiming to lead lives that feel long because we manage to imbue them with the right sort of open-hearted appreciation and unsnobbish receptivity \u2013 the kind that five-year-olds know naturally how to bring to bear. We need to pause and look at one another\u2019s faces, study the sky, wonder at the eddies and colours of the river and dare to ask the kind of questions that open others\u2019 souls. We don\u2019t need to add years; we need to densify the time we have left by ensuring that every day is lived consciously. We can do this via a manoeuvre as simple as it is momentous: by starting to notice all that we have as yet only seen.",

In our haste to secure the future, we fail to notice what has not yet failed us, what isn\u2019t actually out of reach, what is already very good.

      "content": "### Twenty signs of emotional maturity\n\nWe are never done with that most precious of goals: becoming a proper grown-up. For this mission, it could help to know what being grown-up might really involve. Here are twenty suggestions:\n\n1. You realise that most of the bad behaviour of other people really comes down to fear and anxiety, rather than (as it is generally easier to presume) nastiness or idiocy. You loosen your hold on self-righteousness and stop thinking of the world as populated by either monsters or fools. It makes things less black and white at first, but, in time, a great deal more interesting.\n\n2. You learn that what is in your head can\u2019t automatically be understood by other people. You realise that you will have to articulate your intentions and feelings with the use of words, and can\u2019t blame others for not getting what you mean until you\u2019ve spoken calmly and clearly.\n\n3. You learn that you do sometimes get things wrong. With courage, you take your first faltering steps towards apologising (once in a while).\n\n4. You learn to be confident not by realising that you\u2019re great, but by learning that everyone else is just as stupid, scared and lost as you are. We\u2019re all making it up as we go along, and that\u2019s fine.\n\n5. You forgive your parents because you realise that they didn\u2019t put you on this planet in order to insult you. They were just painfully out of their depth and struggling with demons of their own. Anger turns, at points, to pity and compassion.\n\n6. You learn the enormous influence of so-called \u2018small\u2019 things on mood: bedtimes, blood sugar and alcohol levels, degrees of background stress. As a result, you learn never to bring up an important, contentious issue with a loved one until everyone is well rested, no one is drunk, you\u2019ve had some food, nothing else is alarming you and you aren\u2019t rushing to catch a train.\n\n7. You give up sulking. If someone hurts you, you don\u2019t store up the hatred and the hurt for days. You remember you\u2019ll be dead soon. You don\u2019t expect others to know what\u2019s wrong. You tell them straight and if they get it, you forgive them. If they don\u2019t, you forgive them in a different way too.\n\n8. You cease to believe in perfection in pretty much every area. There aren\u2019t any perfect people, perfect jobs or perfect lives. Instead, you pivot towards an appreciation of what is (to use the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott\u2019s exemplary phrase) \u2018good enough\u2019. You realise that many things in your life are at once quite frustrating and yet, in many ways, eminently good enough.\n\n9. You learn the virtues of being a little more pessimistic about how things will turn out and, as a result, emerge as a calmer, more patient and more forgiving soul. You lose some of your idealism and become a far less maddening person \u2013 less impatient, less rigid, less angry.\n\n10. You learn to see that everyone\u2019s weaknesses of character are linked to counterbalancing strengths. Rather than isolating their weaknesses, you look at the whole picture. Yes, someone is pedantic, but they\u2019re also beautifully precise and a rock in times of turmoil. Yes, someone is a bit messy, but at the same time brilliantly creative and visionary. You realise that perfect people don\u2019t exist and that every strength will be tagged with a weakness.\n\n11. You fall in love a bit less easily. When you were less mature, you could develop a crush in an instant. Now, you\u2019re poignantly aware that everyone, however externally charming or accomplished, would be a bit of a pain from close up. You develop loyalty to what you already have.\n\n12. You learn that you are quite difficult to live with. You shed some of your earlier sentimentality towards yourself. You go into friendships and relationships offering others kindly warnings of how and when you might prove a challenge.\n\n13. You learn to forgive yourself for your errors and foolishness. You realise the unfruitful self-absorption involved in simply flogging yourself for past misdeeds. You become more of a friend to yourself. Of course you\u2019re an idiot, but you\u2019re still a loveable one, as we all are.\n\n14. You learn that part of what maturity involves is making peace with the stubbornly childlike bits of you that will always remain. You cease trying to be a grown-up at every occasion. You accept that we all have our regressive moments, and when the inner two-year-old you rears its head, you greet them generously and give them the attention they need.\n\n15. You cease to put too much hope in grand plans for the kind of happiness you expect can last for years. You celebrate the little things that go well. You realise that satisfaction comes in increments of minutes. You\u2019re delighted if one day passes by without too much bother. You take a greater interest in flowers and in the evening sky. You develop a taste for small pleasures.\n\n16. What people in general think of you ceases to be such a concern. You realise the minds of others are muddled places and you don\u2019t try so hard to polish your image in everyone else\u2019s eyes. What counts is that you and one or two others are OK with you being you. You give up on fame and start to rely on love.\n\n17. You get better at hearing feedback. Rather than assuming that anyone who criticises you is either trying to humiliate you or is making a mistake, you accept that maybe it would be an idea to take a few things on board. You start to see that you can listen to criticism and survive it, without having to put on your armour and deny that there was ever a problem.\n\n18. You realise the extent to which you tend to live, day by day, in too great a proximity to certain of your problems and issues. You remember that you need to get perspective on things that pain you. You take more walks in nature; you might get a pet (they don\u2019t fret like we do); and you appreciate the distant galaxies above us in the night sky.\n\n19. You recognise how your distinctive past colours your response to events, and learn to compensate for the distortions that result. You accept that, because of how your childhood went, you have a predisposition to exaggerate in certain areas. You become suspicious of your own first impulses around particular topics. You realise \u2013 sometimes \u2013 not to go with your feelings.\n\n20. When you start a friendship, you realise that other people don\u2019t principally want to know your good news so much as gain an insight into what troubles and worries you, so that they can in turn feel less lonely with the pains of their own hearts. You become a better friend because you see that what friendship is really about is sharing vulnerability.",

      "content": "### Taking it a day at a time\n\nPerhaps without us noticing, much of what we place our hopes in will be ready for us in a very long time indeed; in months or even decades from now (if ever): the successful completion of a novel; a sufficient sum of money to buy a house or begin a new career; the discovery of a suitable partner; a move to another country. In the list of our most intensely felt hopes, few entries stand to come to fruition this season or next, let alone by tonight.\n\nBut occasionally, life places us in a situation where our normal, long-range, hopeful way of thinking grows impossible. You\u2019ve been in a car accident; a very bad one. For weeks, it seemed as if you might not make it. You\u2019ve come out of a coma and are back home, but you still have multiple broken bones, serious bruises and constant migraines. It is unclear when you\u2019ll be going back to work, or whether you ever will. When someone asks how things are, one answer seem to fit above all: we\u2019re taking it one day at a time.\n\nOr imagine that a person is eighty-nine, mentally agile but very slow on their feet and often in pain. They had a fall last month and their left knee is arthritic. Yesterday they did some gardening. Today they may go to the shops for the first time in a while. You ask their carer how they are: we\u2019re taking it one day at a time.\n\nOr you\u2019re a new parent. It was a very difficult birth; the baby had jaundice and required a blood transfusion, but now, finally, mother and child are home. The baby cries a lot in the night and has to take some medicines that aggravate the stomach, but last night was good enough, and hopefully today, if the weather holds, there\u2019s a chance of taking a trip to the park to see the daffodils. How is it all going? We\u2019re taking it one day at a time.\n\nThese may be extreme scenarios, and a natural impulse is to hope that we will never encounter them, but they contain valuable teachings for anyone with a tendency to ignore their own advantages; that is, for all of us. One-day-at-a-time thinking reminds us that, in many cases, our greatest enemy is that otherwise critical nectar, hope, and the perplexing emotion it tends to bring with it, impatience. By limiting our horizons to tonight, we are girding ourselves for the long haul and remembering that an improvement may best be achieved when we manage not to await it too ardently. Our most productive mood may be a quiet melancholy, with which we can ward off the temptations of rage or mania and fully imbibe the moderate steadfastness required to do fiddly things: write a book, bring up a child, repair a marriage or work through a mental breakdown.\n\nTaking it day by day means reducing the degree of control we expect to be able to bring to bear on the uncertain future. It means recognising that we have no serious capacity to exercise our will on a span of years and should not therefore disdain a chance to secure one or two minor wins in the hours ahead of us. From a new perspective, we should count ourselves immensely grateful if, by nightfall, there have been no further arguments and no more seizures; if the rain has let off and we have found one or two interesting pages to read.\n\nAs life as a whole grows more complicated, we can remember to unclench and smile a little along the way, rather than jealously husbanding our reserves of joy for a finale somewhere in the nebulous distance. Given the scale of what we are up against, knowing that perfection may never occur, and that far worse may be coming our way, we can stoop to accept with fresh gratitude a few of the minor gifts that are already within our grasp.\n\nWe might look with fresh energy at a cloud, a duck, a butterfly or a flower. Aged twenty-two, we might scoff at such a suggestion, for there seem so many larger, grander things to hope for than these evanescent manifestations of nature: romantic love, career fulfilment or political change. But with time, almost all one\u2019s more revolutionary aspirations tend to take a hit, perhaps a very large one. One encounters some of the intractable problems of intimate relationships. One suffers the gap between one\u2019s professional hopes and the available realities. One has a chance to observe how slowly and fitfully the world ever alters in a positive direction. One is fully inducted into the extent of human wickedness and folly \u2013 and into one\u2019s own eccentricity, selfishness and madness. And so natural beauty may take on a different hue. It is no longer a petty distraction from a mighty destiny, no longer an insult to ambition, but a genuine pleasure amid a litany of troubles; an invitation to bracket anxieties and keep self-criticism at bay; a small resting place for hope in a sea of disappointment; a proper consolation for which one is finally ready, on an afternoon walk, to be appropriately grateful.\n\nVincent van Gogh (1853\u20131890) was admitted to the Saint-Paul mental asylum in Saint-Remy in southern France in May 1889, having lost his mind and tried to sever his ear. At the start of his stay, he mostly lay in bed in the dark. After a few months, he grew a little stronger and was able to go out into the garden. It was here that he noticed, in a legendary act of concentrated aesthetic absorption, the gnarled roots of a southern pine, the blossom on an apple tree, a caterpillar on its way across a leaf and \u2013 most famously \u2013 the bloom of a succession of purple irises. In his hands these became like the totemic symbols of a new religion oriented towards a celebration of the transcendent beauty of the everyday.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Irises, 1890\n\nHis painting Irises is no sentimental study of a common flower: it is the work of a pivotal figure in Western culture struggling to make it to the end of the day without doing himself in, and clinging on, very tightly indeed, with the hands of a genius, to a reason to live.\n\nIt\u2019s normal enough to hold out for all that we want. Why would we celebrate hobbling, when we wish to run? Why accept friendship, when we crave passion? But if we reach the end of the day and no one has died, no further limbs have been broken, a few lines have been written and one or two encouraging and pleasant things have been said, then that is already an achievement worthy of a place at the altar of sanity. How natural and tempting to put one\u2019s faith in the bountifulness of the years, but how much wiser it might be to bring all one\u2019s faculties of appreciation and love to bear on that most modest and easily dismissed of increments: the day already in hand.",

      "content": "# Introduction\n\nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the handbook that most psychiatrists and many psychotherapists use to define the types and shades of insanity, you will find numerous personality disorders described. Despite this huge variety, and despite the proliferation of defined disorders in successive editions, these definitions fall into just two main groups.1 In one group are the people who have strayed into chaos and whose lives lurch from crisis to crisis; in the other are those who have got themselves into a rut and operate from a limited set of outdated, rigid responses. Some of us manage to belong to both groups at once. So what is the solution to the problem of responding to the world in an over-rigid fashion, or being so affected by it that we exist in a continual state of chaos? I see it as a very broad path, with many forks and diversions, and no single \u2018right\u2019 way. From time to time we may stray too far to the over-rigid side, and feel stuck; few of us, on the other hand, will get through life without occasionally going too far to the other side, and experiencing ourselves as chaotic and out of control. This book is about how to stay on the path between those two extremes, how to remain stable and yet flexible, coherent and yet able to embrace complexity. In other words, this book is about How to Stay Sane.\n\nI cannot pretend that there is a simple set of instructions that can guarantee sanity. Each of us is the product of a distinctive combination of genes, and has experienced a unique set of formative relationships. For every one of us who needs to take the risk of being more open, there is another who needs to practise self-containment. For each person who needs to learn to trust more, there is another who needs to experiment with more discernment. What makes me happy might make you miserable; what I find useful you might find harmful. Specific instructions about how to think, feel and behave thus offer few answers. So instead I want to suggest a way of thinking about what goes on in our brains, how they have developed and continue to develop. I believe that if we can picture how our minds form, we will be better able to re-form the way we live. This practice of thinking about the brain has helped me and some of my clients to become more in charge of our lives; there is a chance, therefore, that it may resonate with you too.\n\nPlato compares the soul to a chariot being pulled by two horses. The driver is Reason, one horse is Spirit, the other horse is Appetite. The metaphors we have used throughout the ages to think about the mind have more or less followed this model. My approach is just such another version, and is influenced by neuroscience in conjunction with other therapeutic approaches.",

      "content": "# Three Brains in One\n\nIn recent years, scientists have developed a new theory of the brain. They have begun to understand that it is not composed of one single structure but of three different structures, which, over time, come to operate together but yet remain distinct.\n\nThe first of these structures is the brain stem, sometimes referred to as the reptilian brain. It is operational at birth and is responsible for our reflexes and involuntary muscles, such as the heart. At certain moments, it can save our lives. When we absentmindedly step into the path of a bus, it is our brain stem that makes us jump back onto the pavement before we have had time to realize what is going on. It is the brain stem that makes us blink our eyes when fingers are flicked in front of them. The brain stem will not help you do Sudoku but at a basic, essential level, it keeps you alive, allows you to function and keeps you safe from many kinds of danger.\n\nThe other two structures of the brain are the mammalian, or right, brain and the neo-mammalian, or left, brain. Although they continue to develop throughout our lives, both of these structures do most of their developing in our first five years. An individual brain cell does not work on its own. It needs to link with other brain cells in order to function. Our brain develops by linking individual brain cells to make neural pathways. This linking happens as a result of interaction with others, so how our brain develops has more to do with our earliest relationships than with genetics; with nurture rather than nature.\n\nThis means that many of the differences between us can be explained by what regularly happened to us when we were very little. Our experiences actually shape our brain matter. To cite an extreme case from legend, if we do not have a relationship with another person in the first years of life but are nurtured by, say, a wolf instead, then our behavioural patterns will be more wolf-like than human.\n\nIn our first two years, the right brain is very active while the left is quiescent and shows less activity. However, in the following few years development switches; the right brain\u2019s development slows and the left begins a period of remarkable activity. Our ways of bonding to others; how we trust; how comfortable we generally feel with ourselves; how quickly or slowly we can soothe ourselves after an upset have a firm foundation in the neural pathways laid down in the mammalian right brain in our early years. The right brain can therefore be thought of as the primary seat of most of our emotions and our instincts. It is the structure that in large part empathizes with, attunes to and relates to others. The right brain not only develops first, it also remains in charge. With one glance, one sniff, the right brain takes in and makes an assessment of any situation. As the Duke of Gloucester says in Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear, when he looks about him: \u2018I see it feelingly.\u2019\n\nWhat we call the left brain can be thought of as the primary language, logic and reasoning structure of our brain. We use our left brain for processing experience into language, to articulate our thoughts and ideas to ourselves and others and to carry out plans. Evidence-based science has been developed using the skills of the left brain, as have the sorting-and-ordering disciplines of taxonomy, philosophy and philology.\n\nAs I have said, in the first two years of life, left-brain development is much slower than in the right brain, which is why the foundations for our personalities are already laid down before the left brain, with its capacity for language and logic, has the ability to influence them. This could be why the right brain tends to remain dominant. You may be aware of the influence of both what I am calling the left and the right brains when you experience the familiar dilemma of having very good reasons to do the sensible thing, but find yourself doing the other thing all the same. The apparently sensible part of you (your left brain) has the language, but the other part (your right brain) often appears to have the power.\n\nWhen we are babies our brains develop in relationship with our earliest caregivers. Whatever feelings and thought processes they give to us are mirrored, reacted to and laid down in our growing brains. When things go well, our parents and caregivers also mirror and validate our moods and mental states, acknowledging and responding to what we are feeling. So around about the time we are two, our brains will already have distinct and individual patterns. It is then that our left brains mature sufficiently to be able to understand language. This dual development enables us to integrate our two brains, to some extent. We become able to begin to use the left brain to put into language the feelings of the right.\n\nHowever, if our caregivers ignore some of our moods, or knowingly or unknowingly punish us for them, we can have trouble later, because we will be less able to process these same feelings when they arise and less able to make sense of them with language.\n\nSo if our relationships with early caregivers were less than ideal, or we later experienced trauma so severe that it undid the security established in our infancy, we may find ourselves experiencing emotional difficulties later in life. But although it is too late to have a happier childhood, or avoid a trauma that has already happened, it is possible to change course.\n\nPsychotherapists use the term \u2018introjection\u2019 to describe the unconscious incorporation of the characteristics of a person or culture into one\u2019s own psyche. We tend to introject the parenting we received and carry on where our earliest caregivers left off \u2013 so patterns of feeling, thinking, reacting and doing deepen and stick. This may not be a bad thing: our parents may have done a good job. However, if we find ourselves depressed or otherwise dissatisfied, we may want to modify patterns in order to become saner and happier.\n\nHow do we do that? There is no foolproof prescription. If we are falling deeper into a rut, and/or deeper into chaos, we need to interrupt our fall \u2013 either with medication, or with a different set of behaviours: we may want a new focus in life; we may benefit from new ideas \u2013 or from something else entirely (I am being vague on purpose; what works for one person might not work for another).\n\nHowever in every successful course of psychotherapy, I notice that change happens in four areas: \u2018self-observation\u2019, \u2018relating to others\u2019, \u2018stress\u2019 and \u2018personal narrative\u2019.2 These are areas that we can work on ourselves, outside psychotherapy. They will help maintain the flexibility we need for sanity and development, and it is to them that we are now going to turn.",

When we practise self-observation, we learn to stand outside ourselves, in order to experience, acknowledge and assess feelings, sensations and thoughts as they occur and as they determine our moods and behaviour. The development of this capacity allows us to be accepting and non-judgemental. It gives us space to decide how to act and is the part of us that listens to and brings together our emotions and logic. In order to maximize our sanity we need to develop self-observation to increase self-awareness. This is a job that is never finished.",

      "content": "# 1. Self-Observation\n\nWhen I advocate self-observation people sometimes assume that it\u2019s just another form of self-absorbed navel gazing. Self-observation is not self-obsession, however. On the contrary, it is a tool that enables us to become less self-absorbed, because it teaches us not to be taken over by obsessive thoughts and feelings. With self-observation we develop more internal clarity and can become more open to the emotional lives of those around us. This new receptiveness and understanding will greatly improve our lives and relationships.\n\nSelf-observation is an ancient practice and it has been called many different things. It was advocated by Buddha, Socrates, George Gurdjieff and Sigmund Freud among others. When we become practised self-observers we are less likely to trip ourselves up by acting out our hidden feelings, less likely to repeat self-sabotaging patterns and more likely to have compassion for ourselves and therefore for others.\n\nThe ability to observe and listen to feelings and bodily sensations is essential to staying sane. We need to be able to use our feelings but not be used by them. If we are our emotions, rather than an observer of them, we will veer into a chaotic state. If, on the other hand, we repress our feelings altogether, we can swing the other way, into rigidity. There is a difference between saying \u2018I am angry\u2019 and saying \u2018I feel angry\u2019. The first statement is a description that appears closed. The second is an acknowledgement of a feeling, and does not define the whole self. In the same way that it is useful to be able to separate ourselves from our feelings, it is also necessary to be able to observe our thoughts. Then we can notice the different kinds of thoughts we have, and can examine them, rather than be them. This allows us to notice which thoughts work well for us, and whether any of our internal mind chatter is self-defeating.\n\nTo help explain the theory, let\u2019s look at this example: how a mother observes her infant in order to understand him or her. She mirrors back to the baby its expressions, its inner states and from what she observes she learns to understand its needs from moment to moment. Being observed, understood and met in this way is vital for the formation of our personality and, indeed, our survival. The practice of self-observation mirrors the way in which a mother observes and attunes to her baby. Self-observation is a method of re-parenting ourselves. When we self-observe it helps us to form and re-form.\n\nIt may help to think of our self-observing part as a distinct component of ourselves. It is self-accepting and non-judgemental. It acknowledges what is, not what should be, and does not assign values such as \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019. It notices emotions and thoughts but gives us space to decide how to act on them. It is the part of us that listens both to our emotions and our logic and is aware of sensory information.\n\nTo begin self-observing, ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhat am I feeling now?\n\nWhat am I thinking now?\n\nWhat am I doing at this moment?\n\nHow am I breathing?\n\nThese simple questions are important because when we have answered them, we are in a better position to proceed to the next question:\n\nWhat do I want for myself in this new moment?3\n\nYou may have made instantaneous changes just by reading the questions. For example, when we bring our attention to our breathing we become aware of how we are inhibiting it, and while we remain aware of it we tend to breathe more slowly. Change happens, if it needs to, when we become aware of what we are, not when we try to become what we are not.\n\nI call these questions the \u2018Grounding Exercise\u2019. If we do this, or something similar, at odd moments during the day and get into the habit of doing so, we can create a space for self-observation. Then if we are going off course we have the opportunity to re-direct ourselves.\n\nWhen I did the Grounding Exercise myself yesterday, I noticed that, when I asked myself the questions, I felt dissatisfied. I found I was dreaming of replacing all my furniture. What was I doing? I was reading an interior-design magazine and I was breathing shallowly. After I had answered the first four questions I was in a better position to answer the last. What did I want for myself? What I wanted for myself, at that moment, was to exhale, put the magazine down and turn my attention to something different; and so I went for a swim to switch my focus.\n\nDoing the Grounding Exercise helps us to place ourselves in our internal experience. People can be loosely put into two groups, those who externally reference and those who internally reference. Externally referenced people are more concerned with the impression they make on other people: What do I look like? What does this look like? Internally referenced people are more concerned with what something feels like: Do I like the feel of this or that better? Externally referenced people want to get it right for others (so they will be accepted, impress them or be envied by them) but internally referenced people want to get it right for themselves (so they feel comfortable with themselves).\n\nI\u2019m not saying that one way of self-referencing is always superior to the other but I do want to stress the desirability of increasing our awareness of how we reference ourselves, so that we can work out how we place ourselves on the internal\u2013external scale. Too far on the externally referenced side and we lose a sense of ourselves and become off-balance. If, on the other hand, we swing too far the other way, towards internally referencing, we may find it necessary to adapt to society a little more, in order to be a part of it. We can ask ourselves whether the way we manage our emotions is prompted by what we imagine other people are thinking about us, or by what we know will make us feel comfortable.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example: two people are sailing in identical boats. One is fantasizing, \u2018Look at me in my fabulous yacht; I bet everyone thinks I look cool and envies me\u2019, while the other is simply enjoying mastering the skill of sailing, feeling the breeze on his face and noticing the feelings that the open seas evoke in him. Two people doing the same thing but enjoying themselves in quite different ways. Many of us are a mixture of these two types; but if we often feel dissatisfied with life, it can be useful to understand how we are referencing ourselves; this in turn will allow us to experiment with change.\n\nInternal or external referencing is one of the things to hold in mind while doing the Grounding Exercise. The Grounding Exercise is about finding out how we are functioning at any one moment. We can adapt the exercise for ourselves. For example, when I do the exercise I check how much tension I am holding in my shoulders, giving myself the opportunity to notice if I am tense, so I can loosen up if necessary.\n\nWhen I am practising self-observation I also take time to notice what I call post-rationalization, which could also be called self-justification. This describes the way we have of mentally \u2018tidying up\u2019 what is going on inside and outside of ourselves, often coming up with convenient explanations which may actually be nonsense, to justify our behaviour.\n\nExperiments carried out by the neuropsychologist Roger Sperry have thrown into question the notion that we are rational beings led by our reason and intellect. In the 1960s, Sperry and his colleagues carried out some experiments on people who had had the connective tissue (called the corpus callosum) between the right and left hemispheres of their brain cut, in order to treat severe epilepsy. That meant the two sides of their brains could no longer connect or interact.\n\nWhen the experimenters flashed the command \u2018WALK\u2019 into the visual field of the subject\u2019s right brain (bypassing the left brain completely) the subject got up and walked as directed. When asked why they walked, a question to which the left brain (responsible for language, reasons, labels and explanations) responded, they never said \u2018Because your sign told me to\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t know, I just felt an inexplicable urge to do so\u2019, which would have been the truth (as the action was triggered by their emotional right brains). Instead, they invariably said something like \u2018I wanted to get a drink of water\u2019 or \u2018I wanted to stretch my legs\u2019. In other words, their rational left brain made sense of their action in a way that bore no relation to the real reason for it.\n\nConsidering this alongside further experiments that have been done on left-brain, right-brain splits4 we have no reason to think that the patient\u2019s left hemisphere is behaving any differently from our own, as we make sense of the inclinations coming from our right brain. In other words, our \u2018reasons\u2019 for doing anything could be a post-rationalization, even when our corpus callosum has not been cut.\n\nEven after our left brains have developed to give us the powers of language and logic, reasoning and mathematics, we continue to be ruled by the mammalian right brain. It turns out that we are unable to make any decision without our emotions. The neurologist Antonio Damasio had a patient called Elliot who, after an operation to remove a brain tumour, was unable to feel. His IQ remained excellent but he had no feelings even when shown terrible pictures of human suffering. We might think that, with his reasoning intact, Elliot could still decide where to go for lunch or what to invest his money in, but he was unable to make these decisions. He could imagine the probable outcomes of his choices, he could calmly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, but he could not come to a decision. Damasio wrote up his findings about Elliot and other patients like him in his book Descartes\u2019 Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain. This book concluded that, contrary to our expectations, a lack of emotion does not lead to logical, reasoned choices but to chaos. This is because we rely on feelings to navigate our way through our lives. This is true whether or not we are aware of our emotions.\n\nIn order to understand our motivation better, it can be helpful to spend more time with our feelings, which is where self-observation comes in. We will not be able to fathom all our feelings; and we should not cling to the reasons we so speedily come up with \u2013 some of these may only be a mechanism for self-soothing or justifying what the right brain has already decided upon. Instead we can increase our tolerance for uncertainty, nurture our curiosity and continue to learn. There is a danger when we prematurely reach a judgement about something that we stop ourselves from learning anything further about it. I do not advocate dithering about everyday decisions (such as what to have for lunch), but the re-examination of our beliefs and opinions from time to time is beneficial. As the psychoanalyst Peter Lomas suggested, \u2018Hold your beliefs lightly.\u2019 Certainty is not necessarily a friend of sanity, although it is often mistaken for it.\n\nWe live in a so-called \u2018age of reason\u2019, and yet, research such as Sperry\u2019s and Damasio\u2019s demonstrates, many of our ideas, feelings and actions come from the right brain, while the left brain makes up reasons for those ideas, feelings and actions retrospectively. Every war might only be the playing out of an old dispute that happened in the nursery, for which the leader concerned is still trying to find a resolution.5 A lone gunman\u2019s killing spree results from a lack of empathy for others, more than from his particular ideology.6 \u2018Ideology\u2019 is merely the reason he applies to his feelings \u2013 of, say, bitterness or hatred. When we argue vehemently against something, we do so not on account of the reasons we generate, but on account of the feelings that the reasons are created to support. They may be the \u2018wrong\u2019 reasons but our feeling is never the wrong feeling \u2013 our feelings just are. A feeling cannot be \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019. It is how we act out our feelings that is moral or immoral. A feeling on its own is no more right or wrong than a needle on a gauge, pointing to how much fuel you have in your tank. We might feel like annihilating someone but it is only the acting out of that feeling that is indicative of dubious morality.\n\nA psychotherapist once told me when he was training that, previously, he had been sure that all his angry feelings were brought forth by the person in front of him, but as he learnt more about the psyche in general \u2013 and his in particular \u2013 he changed from pointing the finger and saying \u2018You, you, you\u2019; instead the finger went round in a circle until he was pointing at himself, and saying far more quietly, \u2018Me, me, me\u2019. As I have said, self-observation is the very opposite of self-indulgence. It makes self-responsibility possible.\n\nOur post-rationalizing capacity \u2013 or what I am calling the left brain \u2013 means that we may come up with reasons not to self-examine. So if you decide to skip the self-observation exercises in this book, try to be more interested in the feelings that dictate that behaviour than in the reasons you apply to those feelings. You are being \u2018run\u2019 by those feelings, so rather than brush them off with your left brain, spend some time exploring them.\n\nA psychotherapist is practised in hunting down the feelings behind justifications and fixed patterns of behaving and helping his or her client to see them. If you have the inclination and means, I recommend psychotherapy or psychoanalysis as a way of discovering more about the unconscious and how we integrate the unconscious with our logical side. However, it can be difficult to find the right therapist, and therapy tends to cost a good deal. There are other means and exercises that can help us develop the art of self-observation. There isn\u2019t a right way to practise self-observation because one size does not fit all. I am an advocate of using whatever works. But however we get there, I believe that being able to self-observe is an essential part of staying sane. As well as using a focused attention technique like the Grounding Exercise, regularly keeping a journal can be a useful tool to aid self-observation.\n\nA study in which half the participants kept a diary and half did not demonstrated the positive effects of writing something down about yourself each day. Diarists reported better moods and fewer moments of distress than non-diarists.\n\nThose, in the same study, who kept a journal following trauma or bereavement also reported fewer flashbacks, nightmares and unexpected difficult memories. Writing can itself be an act of emotional processing so it can help in many situations of danger, extremity and loss of control. People who keep diaries are admitted to hospital less often and spend fewer days there than those who do not. Research shows that liver function and blood pressure are improved in diarists. All personality types are shown to benefit from keeping a diary. I am particularly fascinated by the way that diary-keeping has been shown to positively affect several aspects of the immune system \u2013 including T-cell growth7 and certain antibody responses. Studies have also shown that people who regularly keep daily \u2018gratitude\u2019 diaries, in which they list things for which they are grateful, report increased satisfaction with their lives and relationships.8 However, these benefits are not the main reasons I recommend diary-keeping. I\u2019m keen on it because it is a useful tool for developing self-observation.\n\nA few hints for starting a diary: be honest and keep it simple; it is just for you. Try not to start with a flourish and then tail off after a few days: persevere! What you write is up to you. I am a fan of random memories, as well as what you are thinking and feeling at the moment of writing. I also like dreams. Dreams fascinate therapists because they dramatize experiences and parts of our psyches that we may not have processed into language. I recommend writing down your dreams and your reactions to them in your diary.\n\nIf you cannot think what to write just keep writing to see what emerges. In fact, stream-of-consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning just after waking, has been found to be effective in raising self-awareness. Write in long-hand, and record anything and everything that comes into your head for a couple of sheets of paper.9\n\nIf you read your diary back to yourself you may identify some of your behavioural and emotional habits. For example, can you spot how much justification or reasoning you are using, or how much compassion you show yourself, or how much of what you write is fantasy?\n\nWhatever method you find works best, keeping a diary is a way of processing your feelings, and getting to know yourself better.\n\nLearning and practising focused attention is a key tool in the development of self-observation.\n\nFocused attention improves our ability to observe and experience body and mind in the present and without criticism. There are many names for this practice: prayer, meditation, contemplative practice and self-directed neuroplasticity. Learning to focus our attention is also a key part of the practice of mindfulness. This focusing of the individual\u2019s attention is a feature of many cultures and religions. Rituals as apparently different as Christian prayer and Sufi whirling are both forms of focused attention, but we can practise it whether we believe in a god or not. Practising focused attention boosts our concentration, helps with stress, anxiety, depression and addictive behaviours, and can even have a positive effect on physical problems like hypertension, heart disease and chronic pain.10\n\nThe practice of focused attention has further benefits. Studies have shown that the brains of those who regularly meditate or practise similar behaviours show permanent, beneficial changes. New neural pathways and connections proliferate. The pre-frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain associated with concentration, measurably thickens. The insula, the part of the brain that tracks the interior state of the body, as well as the emotional states of other people, also grows. Thus the practice of focusing attention for the purpose of self-observation literally strengthens and grows the brain. That in turn makes us more self-aware and thus better able to soothe ourselves, and it also means that we are able to empathize better with others. Practising self-observation helps to keep our brains flexible. Using it, we can become more aware of mental processes, without being taken over by those processes. It allows us to develop emotional resilience without repressing or denying our feelings. You\u2019ll find some exercises for promoting focused attention and self-observation in the exercise section in the back of this book.\n\nOne of the things we become more aware of when we develop self-observation is what I call \u2018toxic chatter\u2019. Our heads are always full of chatter, littered with phrases, images, repeated messages, running commentaries on our actions and thoughts. Much may be harmless, but some can be toxic: hateful thoughts about ourselves or others; unconstructive self-scoldings; pointless pessimism. These types of thoughts can go round in circles; they get us nowhere and can cause depression. Self-observation allows us to impartially notice our mind-chatter and distance ourselves from that which is toxic. In this way the neural pathways that promote toxicity will be used less and will gradually shrink, while those that promote awareness and empathy will grow.\n\nUsing self-observation we can give ourselves the same sort of close attention that good parents give their children. As we saw earlier, such mirroring is the way children learn who they are and how to acknowledge, soothe and regulate themselves. Throughout our lives we have a desire and a need to be acknowledged and understood. Although this is most productively achieved in conjunction with another person, contemplative practice is one way we can achieve this on our own.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of ways we can develop self-observation. We may choose one-to-one therapy with a psycho-therapist, analyst or other practitioner, or join a therapy or yoga group. One of my biggest increases in self-awareness came when I trained for and completed the London Marathon. Using focused attention techniques such as meditating whilst running as part of a transformative physical project, I improved my concentration, self-confidence and self-awareness more than I could have imagined when I began training a year before the event.\n\nIn conclusion, practising self-observation can give us more insight into the emotions that play such a large part in our behaviour. When we become more sensitive towards ourselves and more knowledgeable about our own feelings, we are more able to attune to, and empathize with, the feelings of other people. In short, self-awareness improves our relationships. Relationships are the second cornerstone of our sanity, and we will now look at their role and importance.",

      "content": "# 2. Relating to Others\n\nA brain, like a neuron, is not much use on its own. Our brains need other brains \u2013 or, as we more often put it, people need people. We may think of ourselves as an \u2018I\u2019, and the notion of the isolated self takes up a lot of space in Western civilization, but we are in fact creatures of the group, like starlings in a flock that appears as one body against the sky, with each bird affecting and being affected by the movements of the birds closest to it. Our brains are linked together and grow together in relationship with each other.\n\nWe understand that the quality of the formative relationships we had as infants determines our initial place in the spectrum of mental health. However, it is also known that other people continue to be our best resource for staying sane. Any mutually impactful, mutually open relationship can reactivate neuroplastic processes11 and actually change the structure of the brain at any stage of our lives.\n\nI have seen such changes time and time again in many years of practice as a psychotherapist. I have witnessed clients become more fully themselves, more at ease and less neurotic. I believe that it is the relationship with the therapist, as much as any brilliant intervention, that brings these changes about. I learnt from Irvin Yalom, an American psychiatrist, that as a therapist you need to assess how clients feel about the therapeutic relationship, and ask them what was useful and what did not work in each session. As a young therapist I was often surprised that it was not new insight that was the most powerful catalyst for change, but the moment when the client saw that they had moved me; or when they felt accepted because I patted their arm; or when they saw that, even if I did not say anything at that point, I understood. But that is only half of it. I was changed by my clients too: they helped me to grow. In a relationship in which we are ourselves without a social mask and fully present, our brains are continually shaped. Seeing the world from another\u2019s viewpoint as well as our own can allow us both to expand. If we get too \u2018set in our ways\u2019, we are less able to be touched, moved or enlightened by another and we lose vitality. And we need to allow ourselves to be open to the impact of the other if we are to impact upon them.",

      "content": "# Dialogue\n\nThe philosopher Martin Buber said, \u2018All real living is meeting.\u2019 He realized that only in relationships can we fully open ourselves to the world and to each other. Buber wrote that \u2018genuine dialogue\u2019, whether spoken or silent, occurs only when each of the participants really has in mind the other or others, in their \u2018present and particular being and turns to them with the intention of establishing a living mutual relation between himself and them\u2019. I would add that in order to meaningfully connect to another person, one has to be open. This means being not who we think we should be, but allowing ourselves to be who we really are. This usually involves risking feeling vulnerable. Being open, and therefore vulnerable, does not guarantee that we will connect with the other, but if we do not allow ourselves to feel vulnerable, we deny ourselves the opportunity to experience genuine dialogue.\n\nBuber also describes two other ways of being with others. First is \u2018technical dialogue\u2019, which is prompted solely by the need for objective understanding. For example:\n\n\u2018What sort of batteries do I need for this?\u2019\n\n\u2018You need size AAA batteries.\u2019\n\nSecond, \u2018monologue disguised as dialogue\u2019, in which two people who think they are having a conversation are actually talking to themselves. Jane Austen captured this process brilliantly in Northanger Abbey:\n\n[Mrs. Allen was] never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her gowns.",

      "content": "# Mentalization\n\nThe psychoanalyst Peter Fonagy coined the word \u2018mentalization\u2019. This means the ability to understand our inner experience, and from that, work out accurately the other person\u2019s feelings. This process gives us the ability to make and sustain healthy relationships. If all goes well, we have early caregivers who carry out this process of mentalization naturally, and we pick it up unconsciously from them. This process is aided by self-observation, because as we develop and become more sensitive to our own feelings we also become more sensitive to what other people are feeling. This does not mean projecting our own thoughts onto them, but understanding, on the level of feeling, that the way they feel and think might be different from the way we do.\n\nIf we find people so unpredictable that we are unable to relate to anyone, then it is probable that it is the process of mentalization that is letting us down. There is so much that is unspoken and unconscious in the process of relating to another that the only way to learn it is in relationship with someone else. If our earliest caregiver was unable to provide a model for mentalization we will not have learnt it from them. But the brain is plastic. We can learn it later in life with a psychotherapist or in other close relationships. When we begin to understand what it really feels like to be deeply understood, we can begin to understand others and have satisfying relationships.\n\nWhen psychotherapy began it was about the practitioner listening to a patient and interpreting what the patient said, in order to afford the patient insights about his or her psyche. But now we understand that the main curative part of psychotherapy is the relationship itself. It appears not to be relevant whether the practitioner is an analytic Freudian or a counselling Rogerian12, a transactional analyst or a life coach, or from an eclectic school. What matters is the quality of the relationship and the practitioner\u2019s belief in what he or she is offering. In the same way, our sanity and our happiness will have more to do with our interpersonal relationships than with what the weather is like, or what job we do, or our hobbies. We run about, earning a living, achieving things and making a decent show of it all (or not), but what affects us most are the people around us: our parents, our children, our lovers, our colleagues, our neighbours and our friends. As the psychotherapist Louis Cozolino says, \u2018From birth until death, each of us needs others who seek us out, show interest in discovering who we are and help us feel safe.\u2019 A trauma consultant puts it more starkly, \u2018Everyone should walk through an Emergency Room at least once in their life. Because it makes you realize what your priorities are. It\u2019s not the rush, rush, rush and the money, money, money; it\u2019s the people you love and the fact that one minute they might be there and one minute they might be gone.\u201913\n\nStaying connected with others is a vital \u2013 the vital \u2013 part of staying sane.",

      "content": "# How to Have Good Relationships\n\nThis is a \u2018how-to\u2019 book and at this point I wish it was not, because as soon as we start to legislate for how to have relationships, we are already in danger of getting it wrong. This is because if we attempt to manipulate a relationship, there is a danger of treating the other as an \u2018it\u2019 rather than as an equal; of seeing him or her as an object to be steered rather than another subject to meet. Nor can we have a simple rule: \u2018be empathetic\u2019 \u2013 since empathy is only part of a process, not a rigid set of behaviours.\n\nMy friend Astrid had a rule she applied to relationships. When she was working out how she felt about someone she would say, for instance, \u2018\u2026 And he asked me no questions about myself at all\u2019 \u2013 as if she was seeking to prove something; but as I come from a different background I was not sure what it was she was trying to tell me. She explained that in her originating culture it was polite to ask questions when you meet a new person. If the other person does not return the compliment by showing curiosity in return then the suspicion is that they are self-absorbed and selfish. I thought that, as well as sounding like a post-rationalization for Astrid\u2019s not taking to a particular person, this way of looking at the world did not take into account the \u2018negative politeness\u2019 rule14 which is an unspoken part of the rituals of my culture. Gross generalization coming up. Basically there are two sorts of cultures. In crowded countries such as Japan and Britain we tend to have \u2018negative-politeness\u2019. This means that people are aware of others\u2019 need for privacy, and their desire not to be intruded upon. In countries where there is more space, like the USA, people are more inclined to practise \u2018positive politeness\u2019, where the emphasis is on inclusion and openness. The anthropologist Kate Fox says that what looks like stand-offishness in a negative-politeness culture is really a sort of consideration for people\u2019s privacy. So you see, for every overarching rule about how to have relationships, there will always be another that contradicts it. You may act in a caring way towards somebody, but if you have not absorbed the rules of that person\u2019s family of origin or culture you can still get it wrong.\n\nOur codes about manners differ from family to family and culture to culture. Manners are a societal attempt to regulate the way we treat one another. If we follow manners strictly, we may turn into a \u2018super-charmer\u2019, and other people may doubt our sincerity. If we become extra sincere, we may appear over-earnest in a way that might be acceptable in, say, America but not in Britain. It is difficult to formulate guidelines about other people\u2019s feelings because they vary so much, from culture to culture, from family to family, from person to person, and from moment to moment. We are either good at picking up on people\u2019s feelings and attuning to them, or we are not. The way to learn how to be with someone is by being with them; if we cannot get that far we are a bit stuck. In trying to please one group of people we can end up offending another. Asking people what we are doing wrong will either upset us (when we get the answer), or will only tell us what we are doing wrong in their eyes \u2013 and it might not be us who is \u2018wrong\u2019 anyway. Adhering to strict guidelines about how to behave around others is a form of rigidity. Not being mindful of your impact upon others is a form of chaos. What we are seeking is a middle way, which can be defined as \u2018flexibility\u2019; this allows us to reach out and respond to others with attunement. This flexibility is something we can aim for but we should not expect to achieve it in every encounter. However, if we find forming any relationship at all difficult, we may need to invest in consulting a relationship expert, a psychotherapist or another kind of mental-health worker.\n\nVery often we begin a relationship or an encounter with another person by engaging in small talk about the weather, or by playing out the sort of rituals that the transactional analyst Eric Berne identified in the Sixties as \u2018games\u2019. In developed countries, for instance, men may play a competitive game by arguing about whose car is best \u2013 \u2018You\u2019ve got the X5 M? Oh dear, not enough power. You have to have the X6 M model like mine.\u2019 Women in such cultures, on the other hand, often practise competitive self-deprecation \u2013 \u2018You say you like this dress? But it\u2019s so old; I got it from a charity shop ten years ago.\u2019 That game might be called the \u2018Mine is Smaller than Yours\u2019 game.\n\nFor me, small talk and \u2018games\u2019 like these can, at times, feel far more appropriate than \u2018big talk\u2019, especially before I have formed a bond with the other person. I once attended a counselling course in which students were encouraged to abandon their comfortable rituals and games and express the feelings that lay underneath them. I found this hard, because I am uncomfortable with the type of \u2018real\u2019 talk that involves saying things like, \u2018I notice I am experiencing feelings of envy toward you\u2019 before I have even taken off my coat. However, some people prefer this way of relating to preliminary chit-chat. I remember saying to some of my fellow students, \u2018Does anyone want a coffee?\u2019 They all shook their heads and asked me to rephrase my question to reflect my real feelings. So I had to feel and think and then I came up with, \u2018I want coffee and I want you to come with me.\u2019 Having tried it, I found I really liked this process of turning a ritualized question into a statement, and I still try to do this when I remember. Although it is more of a risk (making a statement about myself rather than asking a question of another makes me feel more vulnerable), I find expressing an invitation like this gives me more of a chance of connecting to others. However, saying \u2018I want a coffee and I want you to come with me\u2019 with the old crowd of ex-students has become so ritualized that it is now no different to saying \u2018Does anyone want a coffee?\u2019 If you try to bring meaning to every single word it becomes exhausting (for me, anyway) and if the once meaningful utterance gets repeated it too becomes like ritual, just as those exchanges about the weather have become ritualized. Being real and open is a way to make real connections with others, but connections are made in more ways than simply exchanging meaningful words, and I would never rule out the significance of small talk. We need it in order to bond, and to pave the way for \u2018big talk\u2019. It is the equivalent of monkey grooming15 or the mutual sniffing that dogs do, and we need it. (I would not actually fancy doing what dogs do, nor do I want to look for your fleas, so I will continue to find out what you think of this weather we\u2019ve been having \u2026)\n\nIn Watching the English, the anthropologist Kate Fox has observed that rules exist about how to talk about the weather, and as this is a how-to book, I will share one with you. The point is that when I tell you we have had a lot of rain recently, what I am really wondering is not whether you know how many inches of rainfall we have had but whether you are an agreeable sort of person. I am more likely to form a favourable opinion of you if you agree with me. This is the rule of reciprocity. Remarks about the weather are phrased as questions not because we care about the weather but because we want a response. You may not be particularly interested in the weather but that does not mean you do not care about your relationship with the person you are talking to. It does not matter that the words we use for this \u2018nice-day-isn\u2019t-it?\u2019 ritual are empty. Such exchanges are not about what we say but how we acknowledge each other as we say it.\n\nUnfortunately, whether we are adept at following such rules or not, we often trip ourselves up on the way to forming relationships, and sometimes stop ourselves from having them at all. There are many ingenious ways in which we unwittingly limit our contact with others and thus deprive ourselves of their potentially beneficial influence on us. Sometimes we assume we are having a relationship with another person when that relationship in fact exists mostly in our heads, because we are unknowingly misreading that person. Misreading can happen in several different ways:\n\n- We can project ourselves onto the other person, so instead of having an \u2018I\u2013You\u2019 relationship, we have an \u2018I\u2013I\u2019 relationship; \u2018She will respond just as I would respond.\u2019\n- We can objectify the other person and have an \u2018I\u2013It\u2019 relationship: \u2018If I phrase it like this, she will think of me like that.\u2019\n- We can also blur the boundaries between the person with us in the present with people we have known before, and transfer our experience of people from the past onto this person in the present, and have \u2018I\u2013Ghost\u2019 relationships: \u2018If I do this, other people always respond like that.\u2019\nWe tend to trust people in ways that are derived from past conditioning and experience. For example, we will have beliefs about how trust-worthy a person is. Some people learn to trust no one, and this causes them to lead lonely and often isolated lives that restrict the possibility of full mental health. In contrast, there are those who trust too much and are therefore too vulnerable. Trust is just an example. To a lesser and greater extent we all view people through the lens of our past experiences, and we need to do this. For instance, it is not appropriate to ask the bus driver to show us his driving licence; we have to take it on trust that he knows what he is doing. The key, though, is to be aware of the patterns we fall into when summing people up, and to learn to hold our views lightly and be more open to finding out about the people in front of us.\n\nA group of people I find I always learn from are children, as they can offer us fresh eyes on the world and a new perspective. A schoolboy chatting to me recently said that he thought sanity is not about how knowledgeable you are, or how \u2018realistic\u2019. He knows some clever people with first-class degrees and doctorates who have loads of facts at their fingertips; nevertheless, he experiences some of them as less than sane because they cannot relate to others. He also knows some people who believe in things he personally finds odd (like God or homeopathy) and, although he finds their beliefs unrealistic, he finds some of them appear saner than some members of the former group. He thought this was because sanity has more to do with openness and emotional honesty than with leak-proof logic.",

      "content": "# The Daily Temperature Reading\n\nHere is an exercise that may help you get more emotional honesty into your relationships. Created by the family therapist Virginia Satir, it is designed to improve your existing relationships; you\u2019ll need to persuade your family, friends or work colleagues to do this exercise with you. It is called the Daily Temperature Reading because it takes the temperature of a particular relationship in the here and now. There is a belief that true love, great friendships and good working relationships just happen naturally. Often they do, but this exercise can help the process. It offers ways of confiding in other people, and confiding is an essential element in all kinds of relationships.\n\nFirst, set aside half an hour when you will not get interrupted. Turn off your phones, computers, televisions. If there are two of you, sit facing each other. If you are a group, sit where you can all see each other. Take a minute or two to contemplate how you feel about yourself and your partner or the group. Like an agenda for a meeting, you have a list of five topics to get through. Try not to stray onto different subjects. The topics are: i) Appreciations; ii) New Information; iii) Questions; iv) Complaints with Recommendations for Change; and v) Wishes, Hopes and Dreams.\n\nAppreciations\n\nTake turns to share what you appreciate about each other. Be specific and precise. So instead of saying, for instance, \u2018I love being with you\u2019, be specific about what it is you love. For example, \u2018I love the way you ring me at midday to see how I am. It makes me feel cared for.\u2019 When you receive an appreciation, do not argue with it, or bat it back, or immediately say something like, \u2018Oh, and you too\u2019, because this will take away from its impact. Never put a \u2018but\u2019 on an appreciation, or try to sneak in a complaint by saying, for example, \u2018I would appreciate it if you would \u2026\u2019 Reserve this section for sharing just what you appreciate about each other. You can decide between yourselves how many turns you wish to take to express appreciation.\n\nNew Information\n\nThis section is about sharing the events of your lives as well as being open about your moods, feelings and thoughts and about what is affecting them. It is important to keep one another up to date about what is happening to you. This section is for sharing objective information, such as, \u2018I have a dental appointment tomorrow\u2019, and subjective information such as, \u2018When I lost a tooth yesterday I felt so melancholy, it felt like the beginning of old age. Then I became more hopeful when I realized I still have time left.\u2019 The point is to say what is in the foreground for you, and keep it real, even if you have not worked out exactly what it is you are feeling and thinking. It is about not only keeping others informed of new facts but keeping them up-to-date on how you are working things out and what meanings you are making or trying to make. If there is time and if it seems appropriate, you can tell one another how you experienced hearing the information they have shared, or you can simply acknowledge it with a \u2018thank you\u2019 or a nod. If you have observations about what they have said, do not define the other person by making \u2018you\u2019-statements. You could say, \u2018I have noticed you say you are sad when \u2026\u2019 but not, \u2018You are always sad when \u2026\u2019 Confine your statements to \u2018I\u2019-statements, not \u2018you\u2019-statements.\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat assumptions are you making about your partner or the other people in the group? This is the moment to examine those assumptions. For example, you might say, \u2018The door slammed when you left the room yesterday. Were you angry or did the wind catch the door and slam it?\u2019 When I work with couples I often find that problems arise because they do not examine their own assumptions. Examining our assumptions and checking them out with our partner ensures that we have a relationship with the person instead of a fantasy of them, or avoid falling into the sort of \u2018I\u2013I\u2019 relationship I spoke of earlier. This section is an opportunity to examine your assumptions and ask any type of question. These might be something as mundane as, \u2018What time are we leaving tomorrow?\u2019 or as pertinent as, \u2018I have experienced you as down and distant this week. Is anything going on?\u2019 Asking questions does not mean you will get answers, although you might. It is important to be patient with each other and to foster goodwill. Your question provides information for the other or others as well as being a question in its own right. There is no obligation to answer a question. If you wish, you can merely thank the other for their question, without answering it.\n\nComplaints with Recommendations for Change\n\nComplaints or worries should only be aired in conjunction with a suggestion for how that complaint or worry might be addressed. Without attacking, blaming, name-calling, playing the victim, interpreting or criticizing, describe the behaviour that causes you concern and then explain how it makes you feel (not think). Then say what you would like done differently. When you receive a complaint try simply to listen. Do not defend yourself. You do not have to alter your behaviour, although you may choose to. It is not differences that cause problems in relationships but how we deal with those differences. Because of our background and conditioning our response to hearing a complaint about ourselves can be defensive. When a response to someone\u2019s concern or complaint exacerbates the situation, the likelihood of a fully functioning relationship is decreased. It may help to remember when you receive a complaint that it is only nominally about you; it is really information about the person making the complaint. When we are able to work through qualms and complaints we can become closer through our successful navigation of the challenge they represent. When someone we love shares a concern, it is vital to develop the habit of listening with empathy and with a desire to understand. An example could be, \u2018When you come in from work and immediately start relating your day, my train of thought is interrupted, I forget what I was doing and I feel overwhelmed. What I would like would be for you to check in with what I\u2019m doing and let me wrap that up, or mark my place and where I have got up to, and then I really want to hear about your day.\u2019 The other might respond with something like, \u2018I never realized, thank you for letting me know. Just put your hand up to say stop if I\u2019m overwhelming you again.\u2019 Other complaints might be more tricky to hear, such as, \u2018I\u2019m sick of being the person who puts the rubbish out in this house; I want you to do it for a change.\u2019 This complaint is expressed with a martyr-ish edge. It might have been better to phrase it as follows: \u2018As I put the bins out last night, it felt to me as though I am the only person who remembers to do this. Please could you do it next time?\u2019 The person on the receiving end may have been about to deliver the very same complaint because they feel that they are always left with this chore. Remember: the complaint is about the person making it. The best way to respond is, \u2018I hear that you feel that it is you who always takes the rubbish out, and you would like to change. Thank you for telling me.\u2019 It is best not to argue when you do this exercise. When you next do a Daily Temperature Reading, in the questions section you might say, \u2018It seems to me we both feel we are doing more than our fair share of chores. Perhaps we need to work out a system or get a cleaner. What do you think?\u2019 Remember, the idea is not to fight, and a good relationship is not about determining who is right and who is wrong. It\u2019s about finding a way forward together. A common intervention that psychotherapists make when working with couples is to say, \u2018You can choose between being right, or being together\u2019. As I\u2019ve said before, bear this in mind if you feel wrongly accused: the accusation is about how the other person feels and they will not feel better if they are made to feel wrong as well.\n\nWishes, Hopes and Dreams\n\nSome people hold on to a belief that telling others of the things they really want will jinx the dream. In my experience the opposite is more often true. I advocate the sharing of wishes, hopes and dreams in order to get the support and encouragement we need to fulfil them. Before a race an athlete visualizes how he will jump every hurdle and cross the line at the end of the race. He may not win as a result of his visualizing exercise, but he gives himself a better chance of doing so \u2013 and so will you, as you share your hopes with others. Sharing our deepest hopes can make us feel vulnerable, so support your partner(s) in this endeavour, rather than challenging them. Sharing our vulnerabilities increases intimacy and deepens the connections between us.\n\nThe Daily Temperature Reading can be important to couples, families, work teams and others. To give it a chance, do it, say, every two days for a month as a couple, or weekly for two months as a group. Then evaluate what difference it has made in your lives.\n\nThink about these five modes of communication \u2013 appreciating; informing; questioning; complaining and recommending; and sharing your wishes, hopes and dreams \u2013 and how you use them outside of the Daily Temperature Reading, in your everyday exchanges. Do you use one mode more often than others? If so, consider using a mode that is not as familiar to you, in order to broaden your range of communication. Think of these five categories, as well, in juxtaposition with Martin Buber\u2019s descriptions of types of communication: \u2018genuine dialogue\u2019, \u2018technical dialogue\u2019 and \u2018monologue disguised as dialogue\u2019.

      "content": "# Relating Difficulties: Case Studies\n\nLoneliness and disappointment in relationships can be mitigated if we become mindful of the ways in which we act, and take steps to feel and behave differently. The following two case studies demonstrate how we might go about this.\n\nZara\n\nZara was chaotic in her relationships. She was unable to feel secure with a partner and habitually sabotaged her romantic relationships at an early stage, by acting on her feelings instead of first observing them to give herself the chance to choose how she acted. She was twenty-eight and wanted to find someone to spend the rest of her life with. Using self-observation she noticed a certain pattern in her relationships and she noted down the pattern in her diary:\n\n1. She would choose someone who was good-looking and/or charismatic.\n1. She would go to bed with him at the earliest opportunity.\n1. After sex, she would feel that she was \u2018in love\u2019 with him.\n1. She would behave in a \u2018needy\u2019 way and ring him up too much.\n1. The relationship died, usually after a couple of months.\n1. She would be heartbroken.\nThis was the hole, the habit, the pattern \u2013 whatever you want to call it \u2013 that Zara was in.\n\nShe made a decision and set out a couple of guidelines for herself. When the next man came along, she would: a) not go to bed with him before they had established a relationship; and b) not act in a \u2018needy\u2019 way, even when she felt needy.\n\nAfter a while Zara met a man at evening classes who seemed interested in becoming her friend. She did not assume they would become romantic, but they liked spending time together and met up for a drink once or twice a week. This went on for six months. Then they went on holiday together as friends, but came back as lovers. Zara felt the neediness rise up in her. She wanted to know what he was doing and where he was every second of the day: was he thinking about her? But instead of acting on this urge, she exorcised it, to some extent, merely by writing it all down in a private diary. This resolve not to \u2018smother\u2019 the man concerned appears to have been a good guideline, because their relationship continued to deepen, they married and now, decades later, they are still happily together.\n\nSo, although I am wary of rules, I have to admit that, in Zara\u2019s example, they did allow her to steer her life onto a happier course. Using self-observation you may discover chaotic patterns in your relationship and decide to implement a rule like Zara did, using it as a temporary splint until a more permanent, flexible middle way is found.\n\nSam\n\nRather than rules, Sam needed more flexibility in his life. He had rules such as never to talk about the weather, or to even ask the generic question \u2018How are you?\u2019 Sam deemed such ordinary, \u2018grooming\u2019 questions meaningless, and wrote off anyone who used them. His rules made him difficult to get on with and resulted in him living a lonely existence, with little contact with the outside world. He gained some comfort in thinking himself superior to the rest of the population, but feeling superior is no substitute for companionship and the positive difference friends make to a life. Sam became lonely and depressed. When the depression became unbearable he went to see his doctor, who referred him to a counsellor, Simon.\n\nAfter he had learnt to trust Simon, which took a year of weekly sessions (neural pathways take time to alter), Sam was able to become aware of how he had established his own particular rule book, and how many of his rules were out of date. Supported by Simon, Sam experimented with change and allowed himself more contact with other people. He has not embarked upon a romantic relationship, nor become a party animal, but he has let a few other people into his life, is less lonely, less rigid and is no longer as depressed.\n\nPhilosophers ask themselves the question, \u2018If a tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it, has it, in fact, made a sound?\u2019 I wonder if this question is really asking, \u2018Would we exist if no one witnessed our existence?\u2019 Perhaps we have to ask that, because without another soul or souls to check in with, pass the time with, be affected by and affect, a part of us does seem to diminish. We do feel less human and we are more likely to go insane without the checks and challenges of other good-willed people around us. Solitary confinement is one of the most brutal, most stressful punishments we inflict on our fellow humans. If we are to stay sane, we must not inflict it upon ourselves.",

      "content": "# Learning\n\nBy improving our self-awareness and prioritizing beneficial relationships, we give ourselves a good chance of holding on to our sanity. Our brains never stop developing and we do have some choices about how they develop. The third cornerstone of sanity is concerned with how we keep our brains \u2013 and therefore ourselves \u2013 fit.\n\nHigh levels of stress result in panic or in the brain dissociating. Dissociation is a disconnection amongst our thoughts, sensations, feelings and actions \u2013 experienced as a type of blanking out. Therefore high levels of stress are to be avoided. However, no stress at all means that the brain does not get any exercise. A brain is not unlike a muscle, in that the clich\u00e9 \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 applies. Moderate levels of stress keep our minds in condition, and help us to stay sane. This \u2018good stress\u2019 promotes the neural growth hormones that support learning. Good stress, unlike the type that causes dissociation, can be experienced as pleasurable; it can motivate us or make us curious. More importantly, it triggers neural plasticity, which is why I get excited about it.\n\nIn psychotherapy, quite often, what the client and I are working towards is a position where the client is able to tolerate their feelings. We call this \u2018affect regulation\u2019, a process of inhibiting anxiety and fear to allow processing to continue in the face of strong emotion. To work at this level we cannot be too comfortable, because then new learning does not take place; but nor can we be too uncomfortable, for then we would be in the zone where dissociation or panic takes over. Good work takes place on the boundary of comfort. Some psychotherapists refer to this place as \u2018the growing edge\u2019 or \u2018a good-stress zone\u2019, or talk of \u2018expanding the comfort zone\u2019. The good-stress zone is where our brains are able to adapt, reconfigure and grow. Think of the brain as a muscle and think of opportunities to flex it. The more we flex it, the better our brain functions.\n\nThe richer and more stimulating our environment, the more encouraged we feel to learn new skills and expand our knowledge. Such learning seems to have the side-benefit of boosting our immune system. There are some animal studies that show that an intellectually stimulating environment can compensate for the damaging effects of lead-poisoning. Two groups of rats were given water contaminated with lead. One group was put in a stimulating environment and the other was not. Professor Jay Schneider, who conducted the experiment, said that the magnitude of the protective effect of an educationally stimulating environment on the rats\u2019 ability to withstand the poison surprised him. I am sad to report the rats in the less stimulating environment did not fare so well. I am the same. When I go away on holiday to a new place I feel refreshed by having been stimulated by new sights, smells, environments and culture. This is an example of good stress. I like to imagine I can feel it doing me good, and the rat experiment suggests that it really might be.",

      "content": "# Physical Activity\n\nTo stay sane we need to increase the good stress that is generated by engaging not only in more intellectual pursuits but also in physical activity. The brain needs oxygen and the more oxygen it gets the better it functions. Two studies have demonstrated this clearly. In the first, two groups of sedentary elderly people were tested in four areas: memory, executive functioning, concentration, and the speed with which they could perform various physical tasks, from threading a needle to walking along a line. For the next four months, those in the first group walked for twenty minutes a day; those in the second group carried on as normal. Then they were tested again. Group 1 showed significant improvements in the higher mental processes of memory and executive functions that involve learning, planning, organization and multi-tasking. The implication is that exercise might be able to offset some of the mental declines that we often associate with the ageing process. The second study was carried out on patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. The first group was given medication alone, the second exercise alone and the third medication and exercise together. The results showed that exercise is as helpful as medication in combating depression, as all three groups showed statistically significant and identical improvement in standard measurements of depression.\n\nIt is often the case when we are considering embarking on a new activity (be it ballroom dancing, meditation or other new ventures) that we feel in two minds about it. However, if we decide to override that part of us that is reluctant to change (instead of merely trying to override it), and undertake a new regime anyway, we give ourselves the chance to experience the difference that new regime makes to us. If we are not feeling more stimulated, more interconnected, more alive, no harm will have been done and we can drop it. Starting a new habit means feeling the impulse to maintain your current way of being, but beginning the new regime anyway: it can feel like a wrench. We usually start to send ourselves messages \u2013 like \u2018this isn\u2019t really me\u2019 \u2013 clock such excuses and decide to persevere with establishing a new habit anyway.",

      "content": "# The Nun Study\n\nIn his book Aging With Grace, David Snowden describes his long-term study of nuns. He undertook the study in order to examine longevity and incidences of dementia. He was also interested in links between the nuns\u2019 brain health and factors like intelligence and diet. His subjects provided an ideal opportunity to study the effect of education on long functioning life because the living circumstances of the nuns, in terms of exercise, diet, routine and financial circumstances, were similar, thus making education a measurable distinction between them.\n\nIn this study, Dr Snowden noticed that, while some nuns had mentally deteriorated so far that they could no longer live independently or feed themselves, others at the same age or older were still holding down full-time jobs. He found that the nuns who had university degrees had significantly longer, independent, functioning lives than those who had ended their education earlier. And the longer they continued to study, or embark upon and maintain new interests, the more lively their minds seemed to stay.\n\nWith another researcher, Jim Mortimer, Snowden also studied \u2018brain reserve\u2019. They suggested that a brain that has been actively used in socializing and learning all through life builds more neural connections than a brain that has been less stimulated. So, in the former case, when part of the brain is damaged by Alzheimer\u2019s, the pathway is not necessarily permanently interrupted, but can find a new route around the tangle or plaque caused by the disease. Snowden and Mortimer also found that some nuns who displayed no signs of Alzheimer\u2019s when alive were found to have significant damage caused by it at autopsy, whereas the brains of those who clearly exhibited the condition in life had fewer signs of it when autopsied. Snowden and Mortimer have not yet come to any firm conclusions about the part continuing curiosity and learning plays in building up brain reserve, but circumstantial evidence suggests a connection.\n\nGood stress keeps our brains plastic. A plastic brain can adapt, stay flexible, remain connected to community, and cope with the inevitable changes that life brings. Good stress motivates us by activating our curiosity, firing our enthusiasm and feeding our creativity.\n\nThe hormone dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in reward-reinforcement. We can stimulate its production in both healthy and unhealthy ways. The form of dopamine stimulation that I advocate is learning something new, and the thrill that comes with it \u2013 whether mastering a new musical instrument, succeeding with a new recipe, shooting a ball into a basket or learning to tell a successful joke. Dopamine production is also stimulated by addictive substances or activities, such as gambling. This is an abuse of dopamine and by using it this way we can overload our systems, causing health and emotional problems. Pleasure is good for us but feeding an addiction is not.\n\nIf we are, for instance, hard-working university researchers, we might consider that we are already doing enough learning. It is true that our neural pathways for research will be well developed; but learning how to dance the tango, cook a tagine or speak a new language will supply us with the good stress that builds more brain reserve. However, we need certain conditions for brain building. We must be doing something genuinely new, and we must pay close attention, be emotionally engaged and keep at it. New pathways will form if two or more of these conditions are met, but we will ideally meet all four at once.\n\nLess challenging but also useful are the solo activities sometimes referred to as \u2018brain training\u2019 \u2013 such as crosswords, word search games and card games such as solitaire and patience \u2013 games that appear to be of limited value as transferable skills. For example, when we learn and practise Sudoku, we get better at Sudoku, but it has limited value that we can integrate into the rest of our life. In fact, as a Sudoku-and-other-numbers-games addict, let me offer a word of warning about such \u2018brain\u2019 games. I have noticed, as I play Bridge or Scrabble against a computer, or Suduko for an hour at a time, that my emotional side feels cut off. As a way of self-numbing I would say that number and letter games could compete with class-A drugs when it comes to shutting down our feelings. It feels to me as though the dopamine kick I get from it has a more addictive edge to it, than a learning edge.\n\nIf you too are a games addict, notice the difference in how you feel when instead you read a book. It may feel like it takes more effort, especially when you first start to develop this new habit. A novel, or a book on philosophy, is going to use both sides of the brain: not only will you have feelings about what you read, but your mind will also get more of a work-out because you will make connections between what you are learning and what you already recognize.\n\nWhen I talk about the benefits of learning, sometimes people confide in me that what stops them embarking on learning something is a sense of shame that they do not know it already. Susan Jeffers wisely said \u2018Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway\u2019. I say \u2018Feel the shame and learn something anyway\u2019. No one likes to feel vulnerable16 but unless we learn to tolerate some emotional vulnerability we will be endangering our growth, and if we do not grow we shrink \u2013 and if we do that we jeopardize our sanity.\n\nRecently I was talking to a biologist about the benefits of maintaining the habit of learning. He asked me whether I was right- or left-handed. I said right. He told me that my chances of a full recovery after a stroke would be better if I was left-handed because left-handed people already have more neural connections than right-handed people. He added that if I started the habit of cleaning my teeth or working my computer mouse with my left hand I would begin to build \u2018brain reserve\u2019. If I later suffered a stroke it would put me in a better position to recover from it.\n\nWhatever new activity we begin to do \u2013 from left-handed teeth-brushing, to learning a new language \u2013 we will make new neural connections, which can generate greater creativity and new ideas. A new idea has been likened to a shy woodland creature. To coax the shy woodland creature from the shadows into the clearing you must not scare it. Leave a little food for it and it will come out into the clearing where you can see it better. If you treat it well it will not go bounding back into the forest.17\n\nIdeas rarely come from doing nothing. We stimulate our brains to come up with ideas when we learn new things or when we rehearse the things we are learning. I ran a five-day group for art students and art lecturers about the psychological processes of creativity. There was a general consensus that ideas came not from sitting around and waiting for inspiration to descend, but from working: trying things out, reading, learning and doing.",

      "content": "# Learning Styles\n\nThere are many different ways of learning. Some of us absorb best when we read, while others prefer to learn visually from diagrams, videos and demonstrations. Auditory learners prefer to learn through listening, via lectures, talking things through and hearing what others have to say, gaining extra information from the tone and the nuances. There are also kinaesthetic learners, who learn through moving, doing and touching, preferring a hands-on approach through which they actively explore the physical world. So if we have always thought of ourselves as not being able to learn easily, it may be that we have not yet found the style of learning that best suits us; and, as the brain is plastic, we can, with practice, develop new styles of learning. The more we learn, the more we are able, by linking our areas of knowledge together, to come up with creative ideas. We would not know how physics and skydiving go together unless we knew a little bit about both. Thus the more we know, the more we can create.18\n\nI left school at fifteen and it took me a few years to come around to and enjoy learning. In my early twenties I had a repetitive administrative job. I knew that I felt under-stimulated. Boredom drove me to a College of Further Education recruitment evening. I signed up for Psychology and English A-levels and made new friends at these classes. I remember going round to a friend\u2019s house for the first time and being excited by her enthusiasm. She said, \u2018I\u2019m not bored any more; I find myself thinking about the different motivations of characters in Twelfth Night.\u2019\n\nThis is what learning does. It gives us more things to think about so we have less time to get bored, depressed and under-stimulated. It builds on our existing knowledge and expands it. It leads us to make more connections by linking together more neural pathways. It also connects our brains to other people\u2019s brains.\n\nThe next year I did Art and History. These became subjects that I have continued to build on with further reading and, in the case of Art and Psychology, further courses and a degree. Nothing but good has come from my taking a class. One year I did two evening classes, one in Film Appreciation and the other in Creative Writing. In the former I learnt that I disliked listening to people talking about film plots, while in the latter I did much better. In that class I met my husband. Learning new subjects not only builds new connections in our brains, but in our lives as well.",

Inside the circle write examples of activities that you feel completely comfortable doing. Around the edge of the circle write down examples of activities that you can do but that you have to push yourself a little bit to do \u2013 those activities that may make you nervous in some way, but not so much as to stop you doing them. Draw a larger circle around this circle of activities. In the next band write activities that you would like to do but find it difficult to get up the courage to do. Draw another circle around this ring of activities. After that write down those things you are far too scared to try but would like to do. You can create as many circles as you like.\n\nIt is useful to consider what we are comfortable with and what we are not, and then to experiment with expanding our area of comfort. We should remember that whatever we try is for ourselves alone. It does not matter what anyone else might think. The idea is to expand our comfort-zone in small steps. We go beyond \u2018good stress\u2019 into \u2018bad stress\u2019 if we attempt too big a leap across zones. When I started to push out my inner circle to gradually include the other zones I felt more confident about all the challenges within that original inner zone. I also found that when I set myself a do-able challenge and succeeded my self-esteem and self-confidence rose in all areas. The greatest leap I made was when I went from not being able to run 100 yards to completing the London Marathon. I am sure this is what gave me the confidence to go on submitting my book, Couch Fiction, after its first round of rejections. It was eventually published in May 2010. I have also experienced that if I do not keep on testing my limits, my comfort-zone shrinks back. Challenges that had seemed comfortable one year took courage to achieve the next. I do not want to get into that position again; so, onwards and outwards.",

      "content": "# 4. What\u2019s the Story?\n\nI have included this section on stories because a part of every successful therapy is about re-writing the narratives that define us, making new meanings and imagining different endings. In the same way, part of staying sane is knowing what our story is and rewriting it when we need to.\n\nOur usual emotional, cognitive and physical response to the world \u2013 that is, our typical pattern for dealing with recurrent situations \u2013 will come from our own stories. Our way of being in the world will also come from stories that we read and that are told to us, from films, sitcoms and the news; they might be family legends, or parables and metaphors, or religious tracts and fairy stories. We make up stories, we read stories, we hear stories. Our lives interweave these stories and respond to them.\n\nOur minds are formed by narratives. We evolved using stories and narratives that are co-constructed. As our earliest caregivers transcribed our sensations, feelings and actions into words for us, our narratives took shape. We used these narratives to integrate our experience into coherent meanings. Children and their parental figures narrate their experience together and, in doing so, they organize their memories and put them into a social context. This assists in linking feelings, actions and others to the self. These co-constructed narratives19 are central to all human groups \u2013 from a family in the western world to the hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari Desert. The co-construction of story has negative and positive outcomes. The downside is that the parental figure can unduly influence the child with his or her own fears and anxieties, prejudices and restrictive patterns of being; but the upside is that co-forming narrative teaches ways of memorizing, as well as imparting positive values, group culture and individual identity. A child not only co-constructs the narrative of his or her life with his or her caregiver, but ideally listens to many other stories as well. We may think this is mainly just for entertainment and bonding, but the repeated telling of stories also helps to form structures in the child\u2019s mind that enable problem solving, meaning making, optimism and self-soothing. Wicked witches get their comeuppance, conflicts are resolved and we learn the concept of \u2018happily ever after\u2019.\n\nIn the same way that stories are important in personality formation, they are also significant in the evolution of our species and the creation of culture. Before the invention of writing, stories, sagas and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions that contained both education and the foundations of wisdom. Just as new learning forges new neural pathways to what we already know, so a new story adds to our existing stock. The appearance of certain themes across cultures and times \u2013 death and resurrection, for instance \u2013 testifies to their importance to the species as a whole. Such stories are used to pass down group identity, wisdom and experience for the next generation to build on, as well as giving them ways of coping, self-soothing and facing death.\n\nStories may unconsciously influence us to act in one way or another, but they also enable us to think about ourselves in an objective way. When a client in therapy presents a problem, the therapist often asks them to imagine that problem belonging to a friend and, if that was the case, how they would counsel that friend. This use of storytelling helps us to gain some distance from ourselves and gives us perspective. We can also use stories to help us escape into our imaginations when there is no escape in reality. Children often create imaginary worlds where they can succeed and triumph. Though they may be limited in their choices in real life, they can use imagination and storytelling to soothe themselves during real-life experiences that might otherwise be intolerable. It is not only children who can do this. In his book Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, Victor Frankl explained that while he lived through suffering, atrocity and imprisonment at Auschwitz and other concentration camps he created a place of freedom in his mind and imagination. He ascribes his survival to this act of defiance and hope.\n\nThe great thing about a story is that it is flexible. We can change a story from one that does not help us to one that does. If the script we have lived by in the past does not work for us anymore we do not need to accept it as our script of the future. For example, the belief that we are unworthy of being loved and belonging is just that, a belief. This belief, this story we tell ourselves, can be edited. The effects of such editing can be more positively life changing than winning the lottery. Research has shown that after winning the lottery people take about three months to return to the mindset they had before the win. So, if they were generally optimistic and joyful, that\u2019s where they return to; and if they were self-loathing and misanthropic, they will be after their win as well. A lot of money does not change our emotional life. The way we talk to and about ourselves and the way in which we edit our own stories, can and does.\n\nCreating a consistent self-narrative that makes sense and feels true to ourselves is a challenge at any stage in life. Our stories give shape to our inchoate, disparate, fleeting impressions of everyday life. They bring together the past and the future into the present to provide us with structures for working toward our goals. They give us a sense of identity and, most importantly, serve to integrate the feelings of our right brain with the language of our left.\n\nSophie was a fifty-year-old woman who came to see me. She interpreted her life story to mean that she was washed up and on the scrap heap, because \u2018it\u2019s a young person\u2019s world\u2019. This worried me because people who interpret events in pessimistic ways are more likely to become depressed and ill, and live shorter lives than those who find positive meanings. Together we worked with her statement, not by arguing about whether it was true or untrue, but by examining how it made her feel and whether further meaning or meanings would not be more helpful. Sophie had just finished a fine-art degree and was finding it tough-going locating places to show her work. I told her a story (more of a myth \u2013 I do not even know if it\u2019s true) about a telephone-systems salesperson who made a very different kind of sense of rejection. Every time this salesperson was rejected by a prospective customer he was delighted, because it brought him one encounter nearer to his next sale. He calculated his hit-rate as one in fifty cold calls, so if he counted forty rejections he began to get excited, as he knew the sale would be coming soon. This made him more confident. He did very well and won the firm\u2019s salesman-of-the-year award. Sophie laughed at the story but it stayed with her and gave her the confidence to tell people that she really wanted to be selected for an artist\u2019s residency. When a residency did come her way, she told me, \u2018I did not have to approach anywhere near fifty people. It was more like seventeen. Holding the story in mind kept me enthusiastic when I talked about my work and what I had to offer.\u2019 By telling her story in a different way Sophie changed it, and that in turn changed the way she appeared to others.\n\nWe are primed to use stories. Part of our survival as a species depended upon listening to the stories of our tribal elders as they shared parables and passed down their experience and the wisdom of those who went before. As we get older it is our short-term memory that fades rather than our long-term memory. Perhaps we have evolved like this so that we are able to tell the younger generation about the stories and experiences that have formed us which may be important to subsequent generations if they are to thrive.\n\nI worry, though, about what might happen to our minds if most of the stories we hear are about greed, war and atrocity. For this reason I recommend not watching too much television. Research exists that shows that people who watch television for more than four hours a day believe that they are far more likely to be involved in a violent incident in the forthcoming week than do those who watch television for less than two hours per day.20 Not only does Hollywood supply a succession of movies in which the \u2018goodies\u2019 win by resorting to violence rather than dialogue, but even the news appears to be filtered for maximum emotional shock value, which means it has a bias towards bad news rather than good. Be careful which stories you expose yourself to. I am not saying it is not important to be informed about what is going on, but to be informed repeatedly about bad news will give us neither a balanced view of our world nor of the other people who inhabit it. In contrast to this torrent of bad news, I think it is important to seek out optimistic stories and foster the optimism within ourselves.\n\nI am going to try to convince you that optimism is a good idea.\n\n- Studies show that pessimism in early adulthood appears to be a risk factor for poor physical and mental health later on.21\n- Optimism is shown to correlate with physical and mental good health.\n- Optimistic people recover more quickly after operations and have higher survival rates after cancer. (They are more likely to follow their doctor\u2019s orders and so aid recovery.)\n- Optimism puts you in a better mood and thereby decreases stress.\n- Optimism is correlated with longevity while pessimism is associated with a reduced life span.22\n- Optimists are more likely to trust others and therefore enjoy more satisfying relationships.\n- Pessimists think they are cleverer than optimists but they really aren\u2019t.23\nIf I walk into a party with my head held high, with the optimistic attitude that everyone is pleased to see me or would like to meet me (and I them), I will catch someone\u2019s eye even if, hitherto, everyone in the room was a stranger to me. I will ask them about themselves and they may ask me about myself; we will probably find some common ground and I might learn something from them as a bonus. But more than that, I give myself the chance of forming what feels like a connection. It might last just a few minutes, or it may be the beginning of a long friendship, but in that connection I feel deeply nourished.\n\nIf, on the other hand, I walk into a party with my eyes on the ground, neither interested in meeting anyone nor thinking that anyone would be interested in meeting me, I will not catch anyone\u2019s eye and I will not enjoy the party. I will be thinking about ways to leave it. I will not be fully present at the party. Instead I will be present only with my prejudices; I will be projecting a fantasy, or an experience of the past, onto the present, and relating to that, instead of to what is going on around me.\n\nThe party is life. Sometimes, I confess, I enter the party in a state nearer the second scenario than the first and sometimes in spite of this somebody is still generous enough to make an effort with me and bring me round. Part of the story I tell myself is that if I am down, other people make me feel better.\n\nWhat I have displayed here, even in my confessional paragraph above, is optimism. Whether optimism becomes established as a result of good things happening or, conversely, good things happen because they are visualized, hoped for, worked for and obtained, I do not know. But the meanings you find, and the stories you hear, will have an impact on how optimistic you are: it\u2019s how we evolved.\n\nWhat happens if we never hear positive stories? How would it have affected your brain if you had never heard a \u2018happy ever after\u2019 story? If you do not know how to draw positive meaning from what happens in life, the neural pathways you need to appreciate good news will never fire up. Here is a story. A social worker who works with children was working with a family of three siblings aged six, eight and twelve. They had known only their own unsafe home, care homes and foster families all their lives. Their most recent placement was working out extraordinarily well. They had been placed in foster care with a couple, Brianna and Simon, who were empathetic towards the children and gave them some stability. They listened to what the children said, and were good at interpreting the children\u2019s feelings and able to provide them with support and loving care. My friend spent some time with them all and wrote her report recommending that the arrangement continue. The children were anxious about the meaning of her visit, so, contrary to usual procedures, she told them what she had written in her report. She said, \u2018You will not be split up. You are going to stay with Brianna and Simon. We are going to find local schools for you all and, as Brianna and Simon want to adopt you, we are going to begin that process.\u2019 The children were silent and seemed stunned, so my friend asked, \u2018What did I just say?\u2019 Each child said, \u2018We will be split up; we can\u2019t stay with Brianna and Simon; there aren\u2019t any schools for us and no one will adopt us.\u2019 My friend then repeated what she had said, and again the children could not hear it. She tried again and then the youngest child burst into tears. \u2018Why are you crying, Robbie?\u2019 she asked and Robbie replied, \u2018I think it is because I am so happy.\u2019 Eventually they all understood, but found it hard to take in.\n\nThe trouble is, if we do not have a mind that is used to hearing good news, we do not have the neural pathways to process such news. If we are in this situation we are probably unaware of it, because it is not as though we hear good news and do not trust it. Rather, it is as though we cannot hear good news as good news at all.\n\nHow easily do you absorb good news? If good stuff does happen to you, does it make you afraid in any way? Do you perversely comfort yourself by telling yourself it cannot last? If this is the case and if you were to begin to direct your mind to open itself to more optimistic ways of thinking you would probably experience a lot of head chatter telling you to stop. Note the head chatter, expect it and do not let it put you off. We need to point ourselves in the direction of listening for good news. Start a habit of looking for the positives in any situation, however dire. It will feel phoney at first. Often new behaviours feel false because they are unfamiliar; but an optimistic outlook is no more false than always assuming that nothing good will ever happen.\n\nIt is not easy simply to turn optimism on. It will take more than deciding that optimism sounds like a good idea. It will take practice and good people around us. You will need to keep up the practice of focused-attention exercises so you can pump up the neural pathways that can steer the mind. You may find that you have been telling yourself that practising optimism is a risk, as though, somehow, a positive attitude will invite disaster and so if you practise optimism it may increase your feelings of vulnerability. The trick is to increase your tolerance for vulnerable feelings, rather than avoid them altogether.\n\nIf we practise more optimism, disasters will still happen \u2013 but predicting disasters does not make them more tolerable, or ward them off.\n\nAt one time, when we went away for weekends, I would be quite low for the last thirty minutes or so of the journey home. I used to imagine that our house had been burgled. I pictured myself ringing the police, getting the broken window boarded up, ringing the insurance company. When I opened the front door, however, I would be delighted and relieved that it had not happened. When I began to practise self-observation, and noticed the fantasies I was having and the stories I was feeding myself, I decided to focus on other things when that particular fantasy visited me, and I was able to minimize the habit. When I got this pessimistic theme under control, I noticed that I not only enjoyed the last thirty minutes of the journey home more, but also the whole weekend. Only when I changed the story did I realize that my fantasy had been a cloud over the whole weekend. Sometimes we only realize that we have been living under a cloud when the cloud is lifted.\n\nOptimism does not mean continual happiness, glazed eyes and a fixed grin. When I talk about the desirability of optimism I do not mean that we should delude ourselves about reality. But practising optimism does mean focusing more on the positive fall-out of an event than on the negative. It does not mean denying that you feel sad that, say, a relationship has not worked out, but rather acknowledging that you are now in a position to have a more successful relationship in the future. I am not advocating the kind of optimism that means you blow all your savings on a horse running at a hundred to one; I am talking about being optimistic enough to sow some seeds in the hope that some of them will germinate and grow into flowers.",

      "content": "# The Jack Story\n\nThe deserts of America are lonely places; miles can go by without any other cars or a single house. In one of these wildernesses a driver heard his tyre blow. He was more annoyed than worried, knowing that he kept a spare tyre and a jack in his car boot. Then he remembered; he got the jack out last week and forgot to put it back. He had no jack. But things could be worse, because he passed a garage about three miles back. As he started walking, he talked to himself: \u2018There aren\u2019t any other garages around here. I\u2019m at the garage man\u2019s mercy. He could really rip me off just for lending me a jack. He could charge me what he wanted. He could charge $50. There is nothing I could do about it. Goddamn, he could even charge $150. People are terrible to take advantage of others like that. Hell, what bastards people are.\u2019 He continued absentmindedly telling himself this story until he got to the garage. The attendant came out and said in a friendly way, \u2018How can I help you?\u2019 and the traveller said, \u2018You can take your damned jack and you can stuff it.\u201924\n\nWe can be unaware of the tales we regularly tell ourselves and even unaware of their effect on us. We act on fantasies as though they are realities. And when we visualize something it can happen, because \u2013 whether or not we are aware of our fantasies \u2013 that is what we expect to happen. We have all heard of people who would really like to have a life partner but tell themselves they cannot trust potential mates. Towards the potential partner they act as though he or she is not to be trusted, and keep testing them: Would they stay with me if I was really nasty all the time? They do not mean to do this; they do it because of the story they tell themselves about what others are. Self-fulfilling prophecies are just that: they come true.\n\nMuch of the story we tell ourselves goes back to the dynamics of our family of origin. We get fixed in a story like our fellow without a jack and his belief that man always takes advantage of his fellow man. Therefore we need to be self-aware. What stories are we telling ourselves about other people? What dynamic do our stories suck us into, and how do they determine the meanings we put on things and how we define them? We all like to think we keep an open mind and can change our opinions in the light of new evidence, but most of us seem to be geared to making up our minds very quickly. Then we process further evidence not with an open mind but with a filter, only acknowledging the evidence that backs up our original impression. It is too easy for us to fall into the trap of believing that being right is more important than being open to what might be.\n\nIf we practise detachment from our thoughts we learn to observe them as though we are taking a bird\u2019s eye view of our own thinking. When we do this, we might find that our thinking belongs to an older, and different, story to the one we are now living. For instance, we might be someone like Martin.\n\nMartin always needs an enemy. In every story he tells, there is him and a \u2018baddie\u2019 of some sort. If you hear just one of his stories you might think, \u2018What a good thing Martin is crusading against such wickedness, be it a corrupt mayor, a political cause, non-paying customer or other scoundrel.\u2019 But then you begin to see that every tale features Martin, the crusading hero, against a \u2018baddie\u2019. The plots of his tales are complex and involve the amassing of evidence on Martin\u2019s part. It is amassed through a filter, because once Martin has made up his mind about something, he looks for evidence that backs up his position, and no longer sees anything else. Polarized against the \u2018baddies\u2019 are the \u2018goodies\u2019: if you get into Martin\u2019s good books you can do no wrong \u2013 his judgement of you will always be positive. When you first get to know him, you may not notice anything amiss, but after a while you may recognize the same patterns reccurring. It seems like the dynamic is already set in Martin\u2019s head, and the people around him are simply fulfilling the pre-existing roles he has available. Thus he replays the dynamics of his childhood over and over again. We tend to do the same.\n\nThis is why it is important to understand our past. Contemplation, psychotherapy or an exercise like the genogram (which I will describe in more detail later on) can help us do this. Our dynamic is also wrapped up in the stories we tell, the tales we hear and our background fantasies. All this contributes to the meanings we make that shape our behaviour.\n\nA dynamic such as Martin\u2019s is usually formed by his childhood experience. Perhaps one or both of his parents had the same dynamic and therefore the same filter through which they viewed the world. Or perhaps Martin\u2019s experience was of huge injustice; for example, not being believed when he was telling the truth, or being punished when he was innocent. These grievances fester in the unconscious as: \u2018I was right; they were wrong.\u2019 Indeed \u2018they\u2019 were so wrong that Martin needs to keep finding \u2018them\u2019 and proving them wrong. He needs to feel himself in the right and be seen to be right, over and over again. So he searches out the enemies and wrongdoers he needs to regulate his own emotions and thus feel okay. He needs an enemy to be \u2018wrong\u2019 so he can feel \u2018right\u2019. If he sticks to his dynamic unquestioningly he will not develop or learn and the ghosts and stories of his past will prevent him having true contact with people in the present. He will compromise all his relationships.\n\nThere are many dynamics that are passed down by previous generations or established by childhood adaptations to an environment that the individual no longer inhabits. An example is our attitude to money: we may be striving for money at the expense of our relationships, or believe we have less or more than we actually do. Money is often a metaphor for how secure we feel in our relationships. For example: if we cannot face up to our fear of losing love, we displace that fear by reiterating reasons to be mean with our money.\n\nThen there are our attitudes to place. If we are always moving, never satisfied with this town or that house, this country or that continent, and come up with brilliant reasons as to why we need to move again, the solution is probably to be found in our own psyche, rather than in the geography of a particular place or the ways of its inhabitants.\n\nThere are any number of examples I could come up with to illustrate stuck patterns of thinking, reacting and doing, to show how we use reason to prevent us from discovering more about our feelings. We need to look at the repetitions in the stories we tell ourselves about other people \u2013 at the process of the stories rather than merely their surface content. Then we can begin to experiment with changing the filter through which we look at the world, start to edit the story and thus regain flexibility where we have been getting stuck.\n\nIn my personal therapy I uncovered many such stories and was able to trace the origins of some of them. When exploring my patterns for acting in groups, I used an exercise called the genogram. A genogram is an elaborate family tree, which traces not only blood lines, but lines of behaving, relating, character traits and attitudes. I have explained how to create a genogram in the exercise section at the back of this book. Looking at my genogram I saw that both of my parents come from large families. Then there was something I had not noticed before, which became obvious once it was on paper in front of me: both of my parents had a sibling to whom they were apparently less close than to their other siblings. Both of my parents also idolized one of their own parents.\n\nThen I looked at the way I myself behaved in group situations. In psychotherapy training you usually belong to many groups: your main training group, plus different groups for different modules of the training. I noticed that I always idealized one member of each group and felt annoyed by or dismissive of another. It came as a revelation to me that this pattern was repeated in all my groups, and it dawned on me as I worked with my genogram that I had a pattern for behaving in these group situations that might be embedded in the past rather than be a response to the given situation in the present.\n\nOnce I discovered this I had more choice about how to act. Rather than letting that behaviour continue automatically, I resolved to observe the impulses I had to admire one person and demonize another. If I found myself demonizing a person I practised focusing on what was positive about them. By doing this I changed my negative filter for a positive one. Sometimes it is necessary to over-steer in the opposite direction for a while, in order to find your true trajectory.\n\nThe next group I engaged with was an interview panel for a new job. I had applied for my first job as a therapist, at a centre for recovering drug and alcohol addicts, where I would have to run therapy groups. The interviewer asked me what my group style was. I told them how I had traditionally behaved in group situations and I expected it to cost me the job. However, I did get it. I told them I was surprised, considering I had revealed my habit of favouritizing and demonizing in groups. The supervisor told me that it was because I was aware of this impulse that she had faith that I would not act on it, and that is why they considered me a safe group leader. After that trust was shown towards me,25 I did not act on my old impulse, even though I still felt its pull. I was able to do that because I had learnt to stop and observe my instincts, rather than unthinkingly going along with them. In this way I changed the story of how I act in groups.\n\nAs I have said previously, sometimes a new behaviour feels false or unreal but is merely unfamiliar. In my experience what \u2018feels\u2019 true might not actually be the truth, or good for us; it might merely be familiar. And, conversely, what feels \u2018false\u2019 might not be; it might just be new. I can sometimes still feel a compelling impulse to demonize and idolize members of a group, and if I give in to it, it feels temporarily satisfying. It takes willpower and practice to be aware that I feel the impulse; it feels more comfortable to ignore it. But, gradually, resisting those impulses becomes my nature too. I can free myself from an old dynamic. I can let neural pathways laid down in my childhood relationships grow over, and I can forge new paths over uncharted territory, paths that serve me, the people around me, and possibly the world, more advantageously. Although we are always in danger of reverting to old unsatisfactory patterns, especially in times of stress, new behaviour can become automatic too, and loses its \u2018phoney\u2019 feel.\n\nEach of us comes from a mother and a father, or from a sperm bank, and each of us was brought up by our parents or by people standing in for them. Many of us have siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins. All of these people have an impact on who we are, as do their ancestors. Those ancestors, too, had problems and triumphs, and any learning or habits these experiences gave them they tended to pass down. Red hair or skin tone are easily spotted as inherited characteristics, and it\u2019s not difficult to spot, for instance, an inherited aesthetic taste. Using the genogram we can see how we form and keep (or do not keep) relationships, how we act in groups, how we make decisions and use thought and emotions, and generally find our place in the world. In the genogram these inherited characteristics are as obvious as hair-colour or sense of taste. The point of the exercise is to free you up to make more appropriate choices, so that it is YOU who is making the choices that affect you, and not your great-grandparents. You may feel it is ridiculous to think that your ancestors are influencing you now, but part of who we are derives from previous generations, in ways that can be either productive or unproductive. You can find exact instructions for the genogram exercise at the end of the book.\n\nThrough the millennia, stories, songs and rituals have been passed down by the elders to the young of our tribes. Some of the stories and their meanings get lost. I wonder what else is lost with them? In an age of 24/7 news we tend to be all-consumed with the stories of the here and now; the ever unfolding crises and negative things happening in the world. Do our elders still want to tell their stories? Do we still know how to listen if they do? And if we do not, what are we hearing instead?\n\nI am going to finish with a couple of stories that illustrate, first, how change can come about through dialogue and, second, how wisdom is passed from one generation to another.\n\nDie Meistersinger: The Master Singers\n\nDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnburg is an opera by Wagner. It is a story about a singing competition. The Meistersinger (\u2018master singers\u2019) is a guild-like institution that runs the competition according to strict, pedantic, unbending rules that provide structure and discipline but stifle creativity and joy. Enter Walther the romantic genius, whose chaos injects brilliance, originality, passion, artistic integrity, erotic feeling and, unfortunately, a riot into the proceedings. Here we have the two elements of life we must steer between: rigidity, represented by the Meistersinger, and chaos, represented by Walther.\n\nThe hero of the opera is Hans Sachs, a cobbler, who persuades the Meistersinger that rules are only useful if they are flexible and applied when real need arises. Sachs listens to both sides, appreciates their opposing points of view and engages them in dialogue. He is a learned and thoughtful man who understands the need to steer a course between chaos and rigidity. We see him pondering man\u2019s illusions and the madness of human existence and wondering how to apply philosophy to the problem of getting the Meistersinger to appreciate Walther\u2019s merits and Walther to see the necessity of some rules to preserve the history and story of their country. Thanks to his thoughtful, reflective and flexible thinking and his wisdom, all ends well. Only one of the Meistersinger, Beckmesser, remains unconvinced and unchanging. Beckmesser is tripped up by his own self-interest. He tries to cheat and ends up isolated and unhappy. Sachs, unlike Beckmesser, understands that there is no shortcut to flexibility; it demands integrity, hard work and close attention. Our job is like Sachs\u2019s. We too, have to negotiate that line between rigidity and chaos.\n\nMy Wooden Spoon\n\nI sometimes look at a busy street and think: in a hundred years, we will all be dead. On this same street a hundred years ago, perhaps another woman thought the same thing. Perhaps, however, like me, she consoled herself with the thought that love is generative and lives on in the next generation, passed on in the habits of love we inculcate in our pupils, children and friends. I have my late aunt\u2019s paintings around me, my late mother\u2019s ring on my finger and her words inside me still urging me to tell my daughter to \u2018be careful\u2019 every time she leaves the house. My grandfather\u2019s gruff sarcasm lives on in my father and in me, so he is not really dead. When my daughter lays out a sewing pattern, my fondness for needlework lives on in her.\n\nThis deeply moving process, that connects human to human in a cascade of memory passing through generations, can be symbolized by particular objects that are passed down along with the knowledge of our ancestors. I am the proud owner of a wooden spoon that is worn into an un-spoon-like stump. In the pre-electric whisk days of the 1960s, my aunt taught me to cream the butter and sugar for a cake mixture; we always used the same spoon. Even then the spoon was worn out. My aunt had, in her turn, used it as a child. I use a whisk now; but the sight of that spoon in the drawer brings tears to my eyes if it catches me unawares on an hormonal day. My aunt will be forgotten eventually; my daughter may not talk about her to her children; but I am sure that my daughter will teach her own children how to make cakes. Along with cake recipes she will pass down the love I received first from my aunt. Oh yes, my aunt will live on, even if her name gets mentioned less and less and her spoon is thrown away.",

      "content": "# Conclusion\n\nSo how do we stay sane? We can develop our faculties of self-observation so that we can have the capacity to observe even our strongest emotions, rather than being defined by them, allowing ourselves to take in the bigger picture. Self-observation helps us to avoid too much self-justification and getting stuck in patterns of behaviour that no longer work for us. We can prioritize nurturing relationships and allow ourselves to be open. We can relate \u2013 not as who we think we should be, but who we actually are, thus giving ourselves the chance to connect and form bonds with others. We can seek out \u2018good stress\u2019 to keep our minds and bodies fit for purpose, and we can be watchful of the stories we hear and the belief systems we live our lives by. We can edit our story at any time, to right ourselves if we veer off course either into chaos or rigidity.\n\nIs it that easy? No, it isn\u2019t. One of the things that can give us the illusion of sanity is certainty; yet certainty is a trap. On the other hand, we can swing too far in the opposite direction and become so unsure that we never set off on any path. Extremes appear not to be the best way forward for sanity. I say make a mark, put a foot onto the path, see (and feel and think) how it lands; and then you can make a good guess about where to put the next foot. And if you start to go off in the wrong direction, it is never too late to change course.\n\nI hope reading about how to stay sane has been helpful. To get more out of this book, work through the exercises in the next section.",

In order to embody the habits of self-observation it is necessary to practise them; merely knowing about them is not enough.

Breathe normally and return your attention to your breath whenever it wanders, without trying to change how you are already breathing. Attempt this without thinking in words.\n\nIt takes years of practice before we can maintain this sort of alert, clear attention for even a single minute. This is not an exercise at which you can fail. It is about your experience of the practice. This simple breathing exercise provides a foundation for subsequent exercises, but do not wait until you can achieve it before trying other exercises. Simply return to it often.\n\nWhen one minute is up, notice how the exercise was for you. How did directing your focus feel? Did you notice a change in mood? How did doing the exercise affect you and how long do its effects last?",

      "content": "# 2. The Thirty-Minute Exercise26\n\n- Commit to doing this exercise and allotting the full thirty minutes to it.\n- Get yourself a notebook and something to write with.\n- Turn off the phone, computer, radio and television. Resolve not to pick up a book or a newspaper, and choose a time when you will not be disturbed.\n- Get yourself a clock or stopwatch and set it for 30 minutes.\n- Sit with your back supported. You can put your feet up but do not lie down, as you may go to sleep, which is not the purpose of this exercise.\n- Focus your attention on your breathing and empty your mind of other thoughts.\n- Thoughts will come into your head but do not stay with any one thought. Label it and write it on your pad with one or two words, then let it go. When the next thought comes into your mind, do the same thing. If the urge to stop the exercise comes into your mind, treat that like any other thought, jot it down and focus your attention back on your breathing.\n- Do this for thirty minutes.\nNow look at all the thoughts you have written down, sort them into one of the following categories and then total the thoughts in each category. The numbers at the end of each category are my own results for this exercise:\n\n- Sensory-awareness thoughts: e.g. sounds, sights smells sensations \u2013 4\n- Planning thoughts: to-do lists of wants or needs \u2013 3\n- Anxiety-provoking thoughts: worries or self-deprecating thoughts \u2013 2\n- Playing back of memories \u2013 0\n- Fantasies about non-existent situations, relationships or events \u2013 0\n- Envious, angry, rebellious, critical thoughts: wanting to stop the exercise or critical thoughts about others \u2013 5\n- Take-over: any thoughts you were unable to clear and that took over the exercise? \u2013 0\nYou can add more categories to suit the types of thoughts you have.\n\nThe aim of the exercise is first to see what happens for you; for you to notice how you experience the exercise. You are probably pretty good at noticing the words you use as you talk to yourself, but it is interesting to listen to those thoughts that do not have words.\n\nSecondly, this thirty-minute sample of your thoughts might be an indication of the percentage of your daily thoughts in the various different areas; so, for example, if you spend 80 per cent of your thinking life in fantasy and 20 per cent feeling critical, you can look at that and think: \u2018I have a choice. I may want to experiment. Perhaps it would be more satisfying to allot more of my thinking time to noticing what I can see or smell or if I focused instead on what I appreciate?\u2019 The point of the exercise is to become more self-aware. You cannot change anything unless you know what it is you are changing. The only way you can get this exercise wrong is to not do it, or abandon it early. But even then you can start again.\n\nThis is an extract of the summary I made and the conclusions I came to when I had finished the exercise:\n\nI do not know which category to put my fleeting thought about appreciating marmalade in; maybe it should have gone in memory rather than sensory awareness. Anyway, don\u2019t suppose that matters. I notice I\u2019ve written \u2018too fat\u2019 down; can\u2019t remember having that thought, but I\u2019m guessing I was thinking about myself \u2013 that definitely goes in \u2018Anxiety-provoking\u2019. I had quite a lot of resistance to doing the exercise \u2013 five protests, I notice on the pad. The other thing I noticed is that all the protests happened in the first ten minutes and that the first half seemed to go slowly; then I surrendered to the exercise and the second half almost went too fast, and I was sorry when it was over. After I had finished resisting it, it felt as if I was keeping myself company and that was a good feeling. I wonder if that was because I was then open to what popped into my head? I\u2019m not sure what that resistance is about but it felt very familiar. Next time I feel that resistance I will be curious as to what it is about; whether it is a matter of long-term gain or short-term gain. In this instance I feel satisfied that I listened to it but put it on one side. Had I acted on it, it could be seen to be self-sabotaging. I do find it incredible how a simple exercise like this really does feel like I paid myself some positive attention and gained from it. I\u2019m not sure whether the meanings I have extracted are anything more than post-rationalization, but appreciating that can be satisfying too.\n\nThis exercise gives us information about ourselves that we may not otherwise have appreciated. When we do the exercise once a week and compare the results, we can monitor changes in our thinking patterns. It also lets us get a feel for which thoughts foster our creativity and curiosity and may lead to growth, and those that, by contrast, lead us down the dead-end of post-rationalization.",

The Focused-Attention Exercise\n\nFor this exercise I like to take between forty-five minutes and an hour, but you may want to start with five minutes of focusing, and build up in increments. It may help to have someone read this exercise to you while you are doing it, or you can record yourself reading it aloud, and play it back.\n\nThink of this as a work-out for your brain, so do not go to sleep. Sit on a chair with your back straight, your feet on the ground and your eyes open. First, and without changing it, notice how you are breathing \u2026 When your mind wanders, and it will, bring it back to your breathing \u2026 Notice how your abdomen expands as you breathe in \u2026\n\nLooking down at the ground in front of you, notice what your eyes alight upon; become aware of the colours, textures and shapes you can see \u2026 Spend a minute or two looking and noticing without judging what you see \u2026 Return your attention to your breathing \u2026 Imagine the shape the air makes inside your body \u2026 Notice the in-breath \u2026 Notice the out-breath \u2026\n\nNotice all the sounds you hear \u2026 Notice the sounds outside the room \u2026 Notice the sounds in the room \u2026 Spend a couple of minutes alternating your attention between all the different sources of sound you can hear \u2026 Now return your attention to your breathing \u2026 Notice the sensation of your out-breath as the air leaves your nostrils \u2026 Notice the different sensation of the air coming into your nostrils on your in-breath \u2026 Be aware of any taste in your mouth and smells in the room \u2026 on your in-breath, pay attention to smell \u2026 and on your out-breath pay attention to taste \u2026 Where on your tongue is the sensation of taste happening? \u2026 At what point in your cycle of breath is your sense of smell heightened? \u2026\n\nCome back to your breathing again \u2026 Imagine the clean air travelling through your body to your feet \u2026 Be aware of what the soles of your feet feel like \u2026 What does the skin on your feet feel right now? \u2026 Where is most pressure felt on the feet? \u2026 Then pay attention to what the skin feels on your right hand \u2026 What, if anything, is it touching? \u2026 Now turn your attention to your left hand \u2026 Think about the external temperature your hands can sense \u2026 Return to your breath \u2026 If your eyes are not closed close them now, as you notice how you are breathing \u2026\n\nTurn your attention to your digestive system \u2026 Move your awareness slowly through your mouth \u2026 oesophagus \u2026 stomach \u2026 intestines \u2026 bowel \u2026 bladder \u2026 rectum \u2026 Come back to your breathing, notice your in-breath \u2026 then your out-breath \u2026 Notice the turn at the top of the breath \u2026 How long do you take after breathing in before the out-breath starts? \u2026 Be aware of that pause \u2026 Be aware of the pause at the bottom of the breath \u2026 Now take your awareness to your heart \u2026 notice your pulse \u2026 stay there for a while, focusing on your heartbeat \u2026 Return to noticing your breathing and pause there for a minute \u2026\n\nFocus on the chatter in your head; spend a while observing the thoughts you are having \u2026 Come back to your breathing \u2026 Now imagine yourself being able to breathe underwater, like a fish \u2026 Imagine yourself deep in the ocean, looking up to the surface of the water \u2026 That surface is your mood \u2026 Is it stormy? \u2026 Smooth? \u2026 Now you are a bird flying high above the water \u2026 With the power of your thought you can make the water rough or smooth \u2026 Return your attention to your breathing \u2026\n\nNow turn your inner focus to the person who is closest to you at the moment \u2026 How do you relate to that person? \u2026 How do you feel when you think of them? \u2026 Broaden the net to those you have spoken to today \u2026 Do you feel connected or disconnected to them? \u2026 How do you feel connected or disconnected to your closest family and friends? \u2026 To your community? \u2026 Your country? \u2026 Your world? \u2026\n\nCome back to your breathing once more, be aware of the rise and fall of your breath. Remember what you have just done; you have explored your five most immediate senses: sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. You have explored inner, physical sensations and you have noticed your thoughts and your feelings. You have visualized your feelings as the surface of the ocean while you have observed them; you have felt your sense of connectedness with others, and now you return to your breathing once more \u2026\n\nAs you notice your breathing, notice yourself noticing your breathing \u2026 Notice that you can focus your attention purposefully to any of these areas \u2026 You are not at the mercy of your thoughts, you can direct them \u2026 You can deliberately notice something \u2026 or you can deliberately or absentmindedly notice your attention wandering \u2026\n\nWrite or draw what it was like for you to do this exercise.

      "content": "# 5. The 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise27\n\nSit supported or lie down. Become aware of your breath. As you breathe, give each stage of your breathing a number:\n\n1, \u00a0\u00a0Inhale\n\n2, \u00a0\u00a0Top of in-breath\n\n3, \u00a0\u00a0Exhale\n\n4, \u00a0\u00a0Bottom of out-breath\n\nGet used to counting with the breath. If you spend too little time at the top or at the bottom of the breath to apply numbers 2 and 4, slow yourself down until you are counting and breathing easily.\n\nNow, as you count and breathe, bring in the observing part of your mind. Notice the subtle differences of emotion you experience with each stage of the breath. First of all, compare 1 and 3, then compare 2 and 4. Notice which is the most comfortable stage of the breath cycle for you and which is the least comfortable. Spend as much time as you need to do this.\n\nWhen we have become aware of the nuances of our emotion on each number, we are going to exchange the numbers for a mantra. So you get the whole phrase in, you might need to lengthen the breath; if you are breathing slowly and have plenty of time, do not feel the need to speed up. Replace the numbers with the following phrases:\n\n1, \u00a0\u00a0I take from the world\n\n2, \u00a0\u00a0I make it my own\n\n3, \u00a0\u00a0I give back to the world\n\n4, \u00a0\u00a0I come back to myself\n\nYou can think about whether the phrases correlate with the moments of the breath cycle when you felt most and least comfortable, and whether there is any new information for you there. You can also use these mantras to meditate upon any interaction about which you feel self-righteous or otherwise emotionally charged. For example:\n\n1, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing in) I noticed someone taking my parking space (I take from the world)\n\n2, \u00a0\u00a0(top of the breath) I imagined they did it on purpose to spite me (I make it my own)\n\n3, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing out) I shouted at them not to park there (I give back to the world)\n\n4, \u00a0\u00a0(bottom of breath) I felt self-righteous (I come back to myself)\n\nThen you could use the mantra to think about what you will do differently afterwards:\n\n1, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing in) I will notice someone taking my parking space (I take from the world)\n\n2, \u00a0\u00a0(top of the breath) I will not take this personally (I make it my own)\n\n3, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing out) I tell them I have paid for the space and public parking is around the corner; I make a bigger sign for the space (I give back to the world)\n\n4, \u00a0\u00a0(bottom of breath) I feel satisfied (I come back to myself)\n\nA more positive example could be:\n\n1, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing in) I was taught by my aunt to bake (I take from the world)\n\n2, \u00a0\u00a0(top of the breath) I made up my own recipes (I make it my own)\n\n3, \u00a0\u00a0(breathing out) I pass my learning on (I give back to the world)\n\n4, \u00a0\u00a0(bottom of breath) It feels good (I come back to myself)\n\nWhen discovering these exercises you may alight on a favourite. The 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise is mine. I do it at least once a week and usually more often. I love how, for me, it mirrors the experience of being alive, of taking in or reaching out and then returning to the self. It also mirrors how we each put our own particular spin (\u2018I make it my own\u2019) on what we perceive.",

      "content": "# 6. The Crowded-Place Exercise (Feeling, Thinking, Acting)\n\nThe Crowded Place Exercise helps us discover which \u2018being zone\u2019 is our most comfortable. To use ourselves optimally we need to be operational in three \u2018being zones\u2019: thinking; feeling; and taking action. Normally we are more comfortable in one or two of these zones. The Crowded Place Exercise may help us become aware of which zone we go to first, and remind us to use all three zones in order to maximize our inner resources.\n\nTo start with, do this exercise quickly, without rereading each part. You will need something to write with and your notepad (or write the answers on this book). Your answers do not need to be long. You are looking for first impressions here, not deliberations. (I have used the pronoun \u2018I\u2019 throughout the exercise \u2013 the \u2018I\u2019 is you and not me!)\n\ni.\n\n- I am imagining I am in a crowded place. I am feeling\n- In this crowded place, I have my family and friends near me and I feel\n- The crowd surges forward and somehow I become separated from my group. I feel\n- I am surrounded by hundreds of people but I am on my own. I feel\n- The crowd disperses and I am on my own. I feel\nii.\n\n- I am in a crowded place.

I think\n- The crowd disperses and I am on my own. I think\niii.\n\n- I am in a crowded place. What I do next is\n- I have my family and friends near me. What I do next is\n- The crowd surges forward and somehow I become separated from my group. What I do next is\n- I am surrounded by hundreds of people but I am on my own. What I do next is\n- The crowd disperses and I am on my own. What I do next is\nNow answer these questions:\n\n- Thinking back over this visualization, did you see yourself as a child, one of the adults, or the person most in charge of the group?\n- Do you think it is important that you stick to the role you imagined for yourself?\n- How much difference was there between the feeling, thinking or doing answers? (If the answers were the same go back and do it again!)\n- Which came easiest to you, the feeling, thinking or doing answers?\n- How flexible or rigid are you about what responses you have? Do you see that you have a choice? Or is there no choice in how you respond?\n- Do you believe that your thinking influences your feeling and doing? Or does your feeling influence your thinking and doing? Or for you, is it doing that seems to come first followed by either feeling or thinking?\n- Which would you say was your most dominant zone of being: feeling, thinking or doing? And your least practised zone of being?\n- If you think about some of the other choices that affect how you act, think or feel, and imagine yourself doing them, how does that feel?\n- If you think of the days ahead, what choices do you have in how you think, feel and act? Patterns of behaving are habitual, but what is it like just to play in imagination about changing some of those patterns?\n- What would the pattern look like with one or two very minor changes?\n- What would major changes look like?\n- How many of your answers reflected pessimism?\n- How many of your answers reflected optimism?\niv.\n\n- Feel your response to doing this exercise.\n- Think about your response to doing this exercise.\n- Did you do this exercise? Do you often miss out the \u2018doing\u2019 in your life? Is it a pattern?\nThis exercise may help us to become aware of which \u2018being zone\u2019 we go to first and remind us to use all three zones \u2013 thinking, feeling and taking action \u2013 in order to maximize our inner resources.\n\nI also use this exercise when working with couples or groups, to discover which zone each person is most comfortable in. When this is understood and communicated, people can better understand each other and improve their relationships. For example, I asked one couple I was working with to describe to me a typical argument between them. They told me they were expected at a friend\u2019s house for the weekend. Their host had said, \u2018Start out after breakfast and I\u2019ll see you when I see you.\u2019 The man assumed this meant everyone in the car by half past eight, ready to hit the road. The woman had assumed it meant she could give the kids some cereal in front of their cartoons while she leisurely packed, listening to her favourite Saturday-morning radio show. By nine o\u2019clock, seeing the rest of the family still in their pyjamas, he started to raise his voice and she responded in kind.\n\nThe man was a \u2018do-er\u2019 and the woman was a \u2018feel-er\u2019, but they did not understand this, and found each other\u2019s approach to this everyday situation incomprehensible. Doing the Crowded Place Exercise with each other, and learning that they each had a particular \u2018being zone\u2019 that was more developed than the other zones, helped them better understand each other and predict each other\u2019s responses to situations. This allowed them to be more specific in what they each needed and to come to a compromise \u2013 not because one of them was right and the other wrong, but because they had come to respect that they were different and that each needed to consider the other accordingly.",

      "content": "# 7. The Genogram Exercise\n\nThis exercise can take anything from a couple of hours to a week, depending on how much time you give it. It is best not to rush it, so attempt it when you have the time to do it justice. The genogram is probably one of the most comprehensive tools to aid self-awareness that exists, giving you nearly as much insight into yourself as you might get from a good therapist. But it comes with a warning. Look after yourself while you do it. Listen to your instinct. If you feel overwhelmed by the information you are uncovering, take that feeling seriously and take a break or stop. You can always come back to it later, or when you have more support.\n\ni.\n\nIn the centre of a massive piece of paper draw a horizontal line. At each end of it put a very short vertical line \u2013 to a small square for your father on one end and, on the other end, to a circle for your mother.\n\nIf you were brought up by a gay couple, that would be two circles for two women or two squares for two men. Put their names next to their symbol and their birth date. If either one of them has died put an X through the circle or square and put in their date of death. If there has been a divorce or a separation mark the date of that with a double dash through the horizontal (marriage) line.\n\nii.\n\nNext, put yourself and your siblings on the map, squares for males, circles for females. Put a star in your own circle or square, because you are starring in this exercise. Put in any miscarriages as a little dot.\n\niii.\n\nNow put in your grandparents. Put in your aunts and uncles, in the right birth order. I\u2019m not saying this is an easy thing to do, but keep at it. It\u2019s at this stage I usually start again, on an even bigger piece of paper. Now you\u2019ll have a map of your closest relatives, parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles.28 Now add your relatives by marriage and any additional blood relatives \u2013 your children, your nephews, cousins, nieces; include them all. Pick five adjectives to describe each person \u2013 get other members of your family to help you, but avoid sentimental nostalgia and be realistic.\n\niv.\n\nIf an individual has had more than one marriage or live-in partnership, show this by extending the marriage lines. Put in any non-relatives who lived with your family, such as a lodger or anyone who was especially important to you or your family \u2013 maybe with a line of a different colour.\n\nHere are all the symbols you need on the maps. As you can see, you use different lines between two people to show if a relationship was close or conflicted, violent, loving, and so on.\n\nAs you create the family genogram, what are you noticing? What are your feelings? Are you fascinated or do you want to push it away? Try not to interpret or give explanations for the feelings straight away, but stay with those feelings. By doing this exercise you will be recovering impressions, memories and associations. Invisible messages, such as who you feel able to confide in and who you do not, will be filtering down to you as you create the genogram. You can keep all of these overt and hidden messages in mind and decide which you need to maintain and which you want to become more aware of, so that you can understand the impact your family or origin are having on your life now.\n\nThink about the important choices you have made about wanting, or not wanting, to be defined by what you experienced and noticed in your family. Make a list of these things. Have these choices changed since you first made them? Which ones still operate in your life? Looking at these past relationships, can you trace how they may be affecting your current relationships?\n\nHere are some further questions which you may wish to consider:\n\n- Which family member or members are you most similar to? Which of their qualities do you closely identify with?\n- Think about the earliest messages you got from each family member. What do you think is important in life? Where have your rules for living come from? For example, how much do you feel you can reveal about yourself to other people? Where does your openness, or your reserve, come from?\n- How is love expressed in your family? How is caring shown? What happened if someone needed extra help in your family? Who did they go to, and how did they get support? When you need support how do you get it?\n- How were emotions expressed in your family? How were emotions contained in your family? How were emotions repressed in your family?\n- How were the children treated and brought up? How were they disciplined?\n- What is your fantasy of a happy family? How does this compare to the reality represented in the genogram?\n- What did your parents get right?\n- How have the various family members related to each other, and how has that affected your life?\n- Look for family crises. Is there a pattern? Have there been any complete breakdowns of contact between siblings, for instance? Bankruptcies? Other disasters? Can you identify patterns of blaming? What are the patterns for chaos in your family?\n- What are the patterns for divorce in your parents\u2019 family? What are they in your family?\n- Look at the patterns of the relationships between all the people on your map. Who got on? Who was estranged? Is there always someone who seems to have to play the role of the scapegoat \u2013 the outcast? Is there a culture of favouritism, too?\n- Who has had mental-health problems in your family? Looking at the mental-health problems through the generations, does it seem to come from family traits or from outside events? What evidence is there of the effect of traumatic experiences being passed down generations?\n- Look at your own relationship between you and your mother. Look at her relationship with her own mother. Do the same for your father and his father. Look at their relationships with both their parents.\n- What is the pattern of the relationship to authority in your family? What were your grandparents\u2019 individual relationships with authority like? Your parents? Yours? How have their relationships with authority impacted upon yours? Repeat this question with regard to the opposite sex, ethnic minorities, poor people, rich people, foreigners, etc.\n- How did the patterns you have noticed help to shape your character, your identity?\n- What are the beliefs about the \u2018right way\u2019 of doing things in your family? What is the right way to make small talk or embark on a romantic relationship, for instance? What are the shared values, spoken and unspoken?\n- Do you feel in debit or credit, as far as affection and attention go? Do you feel understood by or unknown to your family of origin?\n- How were the expectations you have of relationships formed?\n- Are there any jobs or occupations that each generation seems to take up? What feelings do you have about the passing on of hobbies or professions?\n- How do the people on the genogram talk about the other people on the genogram? Have you noticed that before? How has it influenced how you talk about other people?\n- What was it like to be with your siblings when your parents were not present? Who played what role? Were you dismissed or valued? Who held the limelight? Who disappeared into the shadows? How has being a member of all these different-size groups affected you today? Do you feel there is safety in numbers? Or do you feel cowed by large groups? Are you fine being with one other person while feeling threatened in a three? If it is hard for you to be in a group today, can you trace where this came from by looking at your family genogram?\n- What are the stories that the older generation frequently told the younger generation? Are you passing them on in your turn? Are there similar rhythms to the stories you tell each other? Do you tell no stories at all?\n- How did your parents use television? Has this been passed down? Think about how food has been eaten in your family. Sitting around a table as a group? In front of the television? Or are family meals never taken?\n- What has been your ancestors\u2019 attitude towards religion? How has this affected you?\n- How open or how secretive has your family been? With each other? With people beyond the family? What is your own attitude towards secrets?\n- What is the emotional legacy you have inherited? Which ways of believing, behaving, thinking and feeling have you inherited from your ancestors?\n- What has been your conditioning as to the right and wrong ways of doing things?\n- Was thinking more highly regarded than feeling or doing in your family? Or was being able to emote or to act given more approval? What is the legacy of this for you?\n- What stands out as the most important (positive and negative) things you have learnt from being in your family?\n- What are the male and female attitudes to work in your family? To money? To sex?\n- What part does immigration or emigration play in your family? Or staying put? How does this affect you today?\n- How are you tackling this exercise? How do you imagine your ancestors\u2019 attitude towards it would have been?\nThese questions are not exhaustive. If other questions and lines of enquiry have come up for you, pursue them. These are just examples of questions you can answer more fully with the help of your genogram. Draw and write on it. You may want to create several with different themes.\n\nFrom the genogram you may be able to remember stories and family legends that are not toxic, but that nurture and nourish. Every family is a mixed bag and it\u2019s important not to throw away the good as we pick out the less helpful myths we have overtly and covertly been told.\n\nI compare this exercise to clearing out a cupboard, one I may not have looked into for a long time. Each object may have an emotional charge, but I need the space for new things; so, rather than keep everything or chucking away the lot, I need to be with each object, decide how I feel about it and either keep it or let it go.\n\nThis is a small sample of the exercises you can do to develop and maintain self-awareness. Some people might do them with a therapist or in a therapy group, but you can also do them on your own or with friends. Doing these exercises, like the job of staying sane, is an endeavour that is never finished. I have done the genogram many times and always find something new. I practise the 1 2 3 4 Breathing Exercise and the Grounding Exercise as part of my daily routine. I go through phases of keeping a diary and I like to keep the expansion of my comfort zone in mind. I would not claim I feel completely sane at all times but I feel this practice helps me in my efforts to achieve this.",

      "content": "## 1.\u00a0\u00a0Hyperactivity and Its Discontents\n\nYou\u2019ve had a normal, and normally harried, day at the office. Urgent decisions had to be made on the hoof, and an awkward exchange with your boss left you a bit rattled. You\u2019ll have to figure out later what it was about. On the way home, on the underground, you open your favourite computer game on your smartphone. Several text messages have arrived from your friends suggesting the evening\u2019s activities; you\u2019ll have to check out the various entertainment venues. At home, you text your partner to say where to meet you later, and try to answer as many emails as possible before going out. The evening is lively and full of laughs, and it goes on till quite late that night. Back home, you look at the Twitter messages which have accumulated during the evening. Some left-over dross of the day is nagging at you, and as you crash for the night, you feel an odd sense of uncertainty. Surely, your day was busy and exciting. Why, then, do you feel as if you somehow missed it, as if it didn\u2019t leave anything behind?\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\nThis is a book about a problem which is elusive partly because it is so pervasive. It is a problem of excessive busyness and overfilled schedules, and their effects on our mental and emotional lives. It is also about how we might address and counter such problems, for the sake of experiencing our lives more fully.\n\nThere have been periods when the great difficulty, at least for some people and social classes, was having too much time on their hands, and the ever-present danger of boredom. Here is S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher, on the subject: \u2018How dreadful boredom is \u2013 how dreadfully boring\u00a0\u2026 I lie prostrate, inert; the only thing I see is emptiness, the only thing I live on is emptiness, the only thing I move in is emptiness.\u2019\n\nLethargic inactivity can be debilitating and depressing; but for us, the pendulum has swung far in the other direction. We live in a hectic, hyperactive, over-stimulated age. Since the introduction of the internet and digital technologies, we have infinite quanta of information, visual imagery, personal communications and impersonal text available to us anywhere and at any time. In the non-virtual realm, too, our world offers a constant supply of activity, diversion and stimulation. In shops throbbing with crowds and bright lights, we can buy anything we can \u2013 or can\u2019t \u2013 imagine. At every turn, we are presented with a mind-boggling quantity of entertainment, high and low: YouTube, music festivals, art exhibitions.\n\nThe busyness of our lives is partly a response to these conditions, and to the demands of our complex, highly competitive societies. Most of us need to work hard in order to ensure a livelihood and basic comforts for ourselves and our families; and if we are to succeed, we are required to function at a high level of effectiveness and alertness. But our predilection for activity goes beyond meeting our basic or even comfortable needs. If we are middle-class, we are likely to work longer hours than we have to in order to fulfil the requirements of our jobs \u2013 or than we have put in since workers were forced into punishing labour during the Industrial Revolution. Home life provides little relief: with perpetual access to the internet, maintaining one\u2019s health through exercise or attending to home improvements, it can be so busy that some sociologists have called it \u2018the third shift\u2019. In a culture that constantly presents us with images of glamour and luxury, we are often caught up in the cult of The Best: we want the best homes, best children, best vacations, best professional gigs. We think nothing of flying for twelve hours to a career-advancing meeting or a conference, the perils of jetlag notwithstanding. We absorb large quantities of culture, which may be all to the good; but too often, we consume culture in the spirit of \u2013 well, consumerism. We do things in order to have done them, or simply to fill time with activity. And of course we spend some hours each day on our digital devices, whether we need to or not.\n\nEven children\u2019s schedules these days are filled up with extra lessons and other improving activities, and of course their young minds imbibe our underlying attitudes towards such things. Writing in the New Yorker a few years ago, the essayist Adam Gopnik describes his three-year-old daughter, who has invented an imaginary friend named Charlie Ravioli. She talks to him on her \u2018mobile phone\u2019 and wishes very much to see him. The only problem is that he is always too busy to play with her; he is otherwise engaged. Three-year-old Olivia is, of course, imitating the adults in her world, whose diaries are always full and who are always in a rush; in some way, she understands that the adults consider this condition to be somehow desirable.\n\nWe have good reasons to be busy. But I believe that if we fill our days with useful or useless tasks, it is because in our over-stimulated environments we have become addicted to activity \u2013 or what might be called hyperactivity \u2013 itself. The digital environment, with its endless supply of instant stimulation and gratification, ups the ante tremendously.\n\nHyperactivity is addictive partly because it can give us a sort of hedonic pleasure. It introduces a welcome sense of eventfulness and dynamism into our lives. Being in motion and on the go can seem both invigorating and gratifying. When we look through our friends\u2019 most recent postings on Facebook, or post a witty sentence on Twitter, we feel a small hit of pleasure. When we move from one appointment to another, from a power breakfast to a planning meeting in the office, we feel a sort of excitement about ourselves and our lives. When we drive ourselves to exhaustion by pushing ourselves to the limit of our energies, we may temporarily experience the kind of euphoria that marathon runners describe as \u2018runner\u2019s high\u2019.\n\nBut after a while, incessant activity can leave us feeling depleted and oddly undernourished, as if the experiences we have been through have not taken root, or become part of ourselves. And, like any hedonic habit, it can lead to states of mind which are not pleasurable at all. Digital addiction is the most recognized of hyperactive syndromes. In Korea and China there are \u2018detox camps\u2019 for addicted adolescents who appear to suffer terrible withdrawal symptoms as they attempt to stay unplugged. Elsewhere, there have been reports of virtual-world gamers dying from dehydration, as they are unable to leave their imaginary worlds for the ones in which their bodies exist. Dehydration is a serious condition, and a suggestive metaphor; compulsive fun turning into dangerous deprivation.\n\nWe get addicted to our devices\u00a0\u2026 and to working on them after hours, sometimes in preference to human contact.\n\nDigital technologies have introduced wondrous benefits into our lives and expanded our horizons; but they are a powerful double-edged force, whose impact on our emotions and minds can be potent. Even for someone of a boringly counter-addictive temperament like myself, digital seduction is hard to resist. For a while, I was seriously hooked on email, and had to give myself stern talks to stop checking it several times a day. I weaned myself from this habit by realizing that in being apparently busy in this way, I was actually doing nothing \u2013 in fact, wasting time doubly by disrupting my concentration, and distracting my attention from more compelling tasks. Now, I understand that by contemporary standards, confining yourself to email in your virtual life may seem positively quaint; but even so, such compulsiveness can eventually turn quite unpleasant. On the affective level, digital cruising can quickly turn from excitement to anxiety, and then to a kind of disgust. It is no wonder that shifting among several media, or using them simultaneously, is called \u2018snacking\u2019. As with snacking of a more literal kind, it can leave you feeling both bloated and unfilled.\n\nPerhaps more worryingly, the consequences of hyperactivity \u2013 of trying to do too much at once \u2013 extend to a very concrete impact on the brain. We may feel, as we cook and text simultaneously, that our minds are quick and agile; but actually, the brain eventually becomes less efficient as we indulge in this, or other forms of multitasking. This is because the brain uses extra energy in switching from one task to another, and eventually it slows down and goes into a kind of gridlock. In the long term, the fragmentation of attention, a breaking up of focus and mental continuity, can disrupt neural connections in the brain and eventually lead to a literally \u2018shallower\u2019 neurological structure. It makes us \u2013 on the physiological level of the brain, as well as of the mind \u2013 less capable of concentration and continuous thought.\n\nThe psychological effects of hyperactivity on both young people and adults have also been closely studied, and not surprisingly, they include Hyperactive Attention Deficit Disorder \u2013 the diagnosis of choice for today\u2019s children \u2013 and the ubiquitous syndromes of anxiety and stress. Stress has been pronounced \u2018the greatest problem of the twenty-first century\u2019, and while such sound-bite alarms should be taken with a large grain of salt (the candidates for the century\u2019s greatest problem are many), there is no doubt that in our relatively comfortable society, perhaps even more than elsewhere, stress is a ubiquitous condition.\n\nOn a deeper level, psychoanalysts have noted a great rise in patients who suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder \u2013 a condition in which a person moves from one \u2018high\u2019 experience to another, without being able to put them together, or create any sense of internal continuity or coherent story about themselves \u2013 what is sometimes called \u2018the narrative self\u2019. Such fragmentation of internal life can be very distressing; and borderline patients are typically addicted to alcohol, drugs or shopping.\n\nMost of us don\u2019t suffer from such extreme disturbances; but we may feel that hopping from one small gratification to another, or being dispersed among several tasks at once, means that our experiences are not only fragmented, but somehow temporary and thin. It leaves us anxious and dissatisfied.\n\nMy friend Emma, who works in an interesting international job, says with some passion that the lack of time for focused reflection is \u2018the central problem\u2019 she feels in her life. It undermines her sense that she can either take pleasure in what she is doing, or accomplish anything worthwhile or meaningful. Emma struggles with how to manage this, and sometimes longs to be back at university, where you occasionally have the luxury of thinking about \u2018one thing at a time\u2019.\n\nThe seminal philosophers of ancient Greece \u2013 Epicurus, Socrates, Aristotle \u2013 thought of their endeavour not as an abstract process of reasoning, but as a therapy of the soul, and whatever their disagreements, they were unanimous on certain basic principles of well-being. Momentary pleasures of hedonism are distinct from deeper and more lasting satisfaction; and in order to achieve such satisfaction, we need to reflect on who we are and what our lives are for. We cannot be fully human without thinking about what being human means.\n\nOur forms of momentary self-indulgence are many, but it is hyperactivity which is our favoured as well as most pervasive form of hedonism; and by its very nature, it is a form of gratification which undermines reflection \u2013 and well-being \u2013 of a deeper or more sustained kind. Emma struggles with this problem; and I think all of us need to consider how to give ourselves time for focused thought and calm concentration; and how to recover the richness of our inner as well as our external lives.",

      "content": "## 2.\u00a0\u00a0Challenges of Choice\n\nOn the way home from work, you stop off at a popular chain store featuring rather inexpensive knock-off fashions. Half an hour later, having looked and tried on clothes in a sort of daze, you emerge with some tops in the latest colours and yet another scarf to add to your collection. Do you actually need them? Well, you think rather sheepishly, perhaps you\u2019ll find a use for them later; maybe they\u2019ll somehow change the way you look and think of yourself this summer. As you walk on, you think you should visit your mother, who has been feeling unwell; but you\u2019ve been invited to a party at which who knows what may happen, or whom you may meet. You\u2019re torn; you really don\u2019t know what you should, or would actually prefer, to do.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\nFor Emma, as for many of us, the problems of excessive busyness are compounded by the constant need to make choices and decisions, in matters ranging from frivolous to important, from material to moral. The sheer plenitude of material goods available to us \u2013 from food to fashion, ingenious home appliances to sexy cars \u2013 can itself result in forms of compulsive behaviour, as we can see in occasional outbreaks of mass consumer hysteria, in which people have been trampled by crowds pressing into shopping outlets when some big sale is announced. I must say that my memories of the old Eastern Europe, where only two kinds of shampoo and three colours of house paint were available at the best of times, occasionally acquire a certain idyllic tinge.\n\nBut in our advanced, multicultural democracies, the freedom \u2013 or is it the necessity \u2013 of choice extends to more essential and existential issues. On every level of our lives, from childbirth to death, from education to religion, from career to sexual identity, we are free to do as we like and to change our minds as often as we wish. Of course, the idea that we are totally free to choose is to some extent an illusion, as many commentators, including Renata Salecl in her insightful book The Tyranny of Choice, have pointed out. The range of our actual choices is limited by our circumstances, abilities and actual opportunities. I might wish I could be a wonderful ballerina, or buy that bottle-green Jaguar, but I can\u2019t.\n\nSometimes you can have too much of a good thing \u2013 and much too much choice.\n\nNevertheless, because we are presented with ostensible options in all areas of life, we have a nagging sense that maybe we should be taking advantage of them. Even if we don\u2019t want to break up with our current partner, we think that we could just perhaps find \u2013 or at least look for \u2013 others. After all, they are right out there in large numbers, on all those dating websites. Even if we are not about to leave our job, it is hard to get rid of a murmur in our head saying that we could find something more interesting, or more worthwhile, or better paid. We see other people doing something different or seemingly more gratifying all the time, both within our immediate vicinity, and in the larger world made visible to us by the old and new media. At the same time, the great diversity of lifestyles, options and values in our cultures and open societies means that there are few common criteria for making important life choices. How do you decide if it\u2019s better to be more successful, or more devoted to the welfare of others? How do you ascertain if you prefer to be monogamous, or insouciantly serial in your relationships? At each level of our experience, we need to find motives and reasons for what we want or don\u2019t want to do, within ourselves. At the same time, the sheer seductions of availability make it hard for us to decide among various options, and to separate external influences from our own values and preferences. Our minds are overcrowded in these less tangible ways as well, and this sometimes leads to a kind of stoppage, or the inability to make any decisions at all.\n\nThe same philosophers who made distinctions between momentary hedonism and deeper satisfaction thought that no matter what material comforts or refinements we enjoy, we cannot attain the good life without some idea of shaping purpose, or conviction of meaningfulness and worth, pervading our moments and activities. That is a grand goal and aspiration; but even on a less overarching scale, the plenitude of choice on every level makes finding a direction and ascertaining our own aims more difficult.\n\nHow then, given the pressures and distractions of our lives, can we regain our perspective and coherence of self? How can we reclaim a sense that our experiences have personal meaning and depth \u2013 that we are not moving through them routinely or shallowly? The pressures are real and not easily dispelled; and one kind of solution is to opt out of them altogether, and adopt various forms of \u2018dropping out\u2019: living in an isolated place, forsaking the idea of a regular job, or going off to a remote Zen monastery. Yet others declare a boycott on choice itself, taking an example from such books as Choosing Not to Choose by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein. I do not mean to dismiss such solutions; for some people, they are right and make for happier lives. But for most of us, these are extreme measures. Unless we are of a particularly meditative or solitary temperament, most of us want to live in the world and remain engaged with it. We want to be effective in what we do, to lead sociable lives and cultivate close relationships and friendships. We want, sometimes, to take risks, stretch ourselves further or have adventures.\n\nThe question for most of us is not how to retreat from the world, but how to retain our bearings within it, and to live more fully rather than just more busily. The temperate answer I want to propose is that we need to alternate periods of energetic activity with relaxed receptivity, directed effort with intervals of goal-less, undutiful leisure. Whether we have seen the neurological evidence or not, many of us sense the need for time free of distractions, and the deprivation that follows from its lack. It is easy, amidst the plethora of diversions and options offered by our societies, to lose track of why we do what we do, what we truly want, and what it is about our activities or our lives that we value and love. In order to discern or rediscover our own, internally impelled values and motives, we need to pull back from driven activity, and to take time to process and make sense of our experiences; to delve into the deeper strata of our inner lives, or to examine our situations through more analytic thought. We also need moments of unpressured idleness to replenish our energies and restore our capacity for ordinary pleasure and enjoyment. If we don\u2019t take the time to do that, we can become depleted and disoriented, and begin to move through what we are doing automatically, without a conscious sense of purpose, or making real acts of choice. And that, eventually, makes us not only less satisfied, but less effective at what we do.\n\nTo put it simply, I want to remind us of what the early philosophers understood so well: the value and salutary power of reflection and self-knowledge. These are worth developing for their own sake; but I believe they are also necessary if we are to replace the excitement of hectic and sometimes aimless activity with full consciousness and purposeful engagement. True engagement \u2013 the ability to give ourselves deliberately and unreservedly to a task or a personal interaction \u2013 arises from a clear sense of our own desires, goals and intentions. It is when our energies and our perspective are replenished that we can return to our active lives with a renewed sense of pleasure and commitment. In other words, it is only if we periodically disengage, that we can become truly and effectively engaged.\n\nThis book has a tripartite structure: in the first part, I have tried to set out the problems of hyperactivity and excessive choice, and the states of mind they produce. In the second, I will consider the pleasures and uses of leisure, and mention some of my favourite ways to be idle, in the hope that they\u2019ll stimulate some of your own ideas on the subject. These include not only passive relaxation, but cultivating all our capacities for curiosity, appreciation of beauty and creative contemplation \u2013 acts and states of self which nurture us and allow us to perceive the world more fully. In the third part I will look at the experience of happy absorption or \u2018flow\u2019 that follows from purposeful engagement, and its various expressions in work, relationships and creative play.\n\nI have written about some of the problems of fast and slow temporality in my short book on Time. But the questions raised there have continued to preoccupy me, and here I would like to explore them from a different point of view, and to look not only at the patterns of human temporality, but how we can create ways of moving through time which are meaningful and enriching. A richness of experience proceeds from within and is intimately bound up with ways of understanding ourselves and our situation. I want to explore some of these connections, and to suggest that being fully and consciously involved in our lives is the only reliable antidote to the discomforts of ennui or anxious emptiness; and that for that, we need sometimes to take time off and time out.",

      "content": "## 3.\u00a0\u00a0Idleness\n\nWhy do many of us find it so difficult to take time off from obligations, or uninterrupted activity \u2013 to allow ourselves, occasionally, to do nothing?\n\nIn 1952, an American psychiatrist, Alexander Reid Martin, wrote an article titled \u2018The Fear of Relaxation and Leisure\u2019. In it, he describes patients who could not tolerate the idea of time free from work. Some of them could not go on holiday without a doctor\u2019s prescription; others had heart attacks or committed suicide when they forced themselves, or were forced, to take a vacation.\n\nNot many people have such extreme reactions to going on holiday anymore; instead, to some extent we have banished real leisure altogether. Our restlessness, and the appurtenances of digital activity, can be taken anywhere; and many of us bring them with us on our vacations. It seems that while we are no longer driven by the work ethic, as Dr Martin\u2019s patients were, an addiction to activity \u2013 and an accompanying fear of restfulness \u2013 is still with us. We may hold to the subliminal belief that occupation \u2013 of whatever kind \u2013 is virtuous, and laziness a vice. Or we may be afraid of falling into a Kierkegaardian state of emptiness, or what in early Christianity was called sloth \u2013 a vice leading straight to the ultimate sin of despair.\n\nThe word \u2018leisure\u2019 comes from Latin licere, to be permitted \u2013 and perhaps the first step in learning how to take time off is to give ourselves permission to do so. We might think of those early philosophers who devoted their lives to the cultivation of the self, and to conversation about the essential matters of existence, through which they thought they could also improve the lives of others. Or we might remember the thinkers of many periods who saw leisure as the very foundation of culture: of contemplation, the spiritual life and even the liberal arts. (The Greek word for school \u2013 schole \u2013 was derived from the word for leisure.) No less a personage than Bertrand Russell, in an essay called \u2018In Praise of Idleness\u2019, averred \u2018that\u00a0\u2026 there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached\u2019. Russell, like his friend John Maynard Keynes, thought the solution was to adopt a four-hour working day, which would leave everyone free to pursue philosophy, cultural diversions and adult learning.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that the majority of humankind would find that much free time a boon, or that these oddly unrealistic proposals would be economically tenable for any society. Probably none of the older models of leisure are suited to our situation; for one thing, we are no longer divided between leisured and labouring classes, with free time being the prerogative of aristocratic elites. The great majority of us need to work, although perhaps not as relentlessly as many of us choose to; and we need to find ways of being leisurely that fit into our lives and enrich them. Still, the value attached to leisure in various traditions should reassure us. It is also worth remembering that leisure is not the same as laziness; and that it is necessary not only to the life of the mind, but to our physical and emotional well-being.\n\nIf we have given ourselves the assent to take time off, then perhaps we can first of all learn to enjoy moments or hours of unscripted idleness \u2013 intervals in which we can slough off the tensions accumulated during the day or week, and return to more pleasurable states of self and mind. Our cultures provide structured ways of calming down, such as yoga or the very popular Mindfulness movement, which specializes in condensed, short-term meditation. Indeed, the very brevity of Mindfulness sessions acknowledges the busy conditions of our lives; and its programme teaches its followers techniques for clearing their minds and reviving their energies through a foreshortened and compressed meditational process. Recently, some big organizations (such as Google) have caught on to the usefulness of such breaks \u2013 just as some of them have built in short naps for their employees \u2013 in making people work more efficiently afterwards. Many Mindfulness adherents have testified to the beneficial effects of such techniques, and there is no reason to doubt them. Others, however, find it too regimented and didactic; and I must admit that the idea of napping or meditating on cue in order to work better in the afternoon fills me with slight dread. It also seems to me a contradictory method of becoming peacefully self-aware.\n\nMy preference is for forms of relaxation which are less programmatic and more improvised; which proceed from individual personality rather than generalized precepts; and which restore us to a sense of positive pleasure in the texture of our daily lives, rather than just clearing our minds of problematic thoughts. It would be rather ironic for me to give instructions on how to do this; but perhaps some examples can be suggestive. I have a friend who sets aside a day a week to do nothing that she doesn\u2019t feel like doing, and to follow her impulses if she does feel like doing something. She often sits in her favourite spot along an urban river, or in a cafe; sometimes she finds herself writing in her diary. A composer I know told me that he spends a part of each morning sitting at his kitchen table with a cup of coffee and letting thoughts and sensations arise as they will, without imposing particular order or meaning on them. He is a productive artist who understands the need for disciplined work; but he says that his seemingly lazy mornings are important to his process of composition.\n\nNot all of us are going to write musical works as a result of a slow morning; but we all occasionally need to be able simply to savour the moment, to follow our errant musings and impulses, and sense the rhythms and inclinations of our thoughts and bodies. One consequence of spending so much time in the virtual world is that we become disconnected from our own physical presence and the physicality of our environment. Aside from depriving us of a fundamental sense of pleasure, this can affect our well-being. After all, the body is the very basis of the self; if it becomes too abstracted or dissociated from us, we may lose track of its needs, or the relish of its appetites. We may not know, for example, how much, or how little, we actually want to eat.\n\nSavouring a long cup of coffee; relishing a new recipe that appeals to us; taking a slow saunter in a park or down an urban street without forcing the pace of our walk; these are ways of reconnecting with the sensuality of our bodies when we are not straining them through exercise or restraining them by sitting at the desk. They are ways of savouring the small pleasures of daily life, and of recovering the basic enjoyment of moving through the physical world.\n\nWalking is of course a pastime with a long tradition, and writers from Coleridge to William Hazlitt have testified to the connection between the rhythms of this basic activity and creative thought. Coleridge especially took heroic walks, roaming for tens of miles over hill and dale, often in adverse weather conditions. On our idle days, we might not want to do anything so strenuous, and might want instead to amble in our own neighbourhood. If we live near a park, or in a rural setting, we can get the benefits of natural surroundings. Natural beauty, if we can relax into it, is a source of never-ending variety and aesthetic pleasure. Moreover, studies have shown that it has undoubted positive effects on our health. For example, hospital patients whose rooms look out onto a garden or some trees recover faster than those who have to stare all day at monotonous concrete.\n\nBut urban walking also has its rich sensations. Exploring one\u2019s own neighbourhood can be as satisfying as travelling to exotic places, in a different way. When we walk down a familiar street which perhaps leads to something surprising, we can notice not only the large panorama, but the specific details. A new shop or an interesting bit of architectural design we\u2019ve never spotted can also enliven our interest in our surroundings, and aesthetic appreciation. We are attached to our environment through our connection to small things as well as abstractions or big vistas \u2013 through what anthropologists, and latterly airport advertisements, call local knowledge.\n\nHere\u2019s Virginia Woolf on taking an evening walk in London, in an essay called \u2018Street Haunting\u2019:\n\nPassing, glimpsing, everything seems accidentally but miraculously sprinkled with beauty, as if the tide of trade which deposits its burden so punctually and prosaically upon the shores of Oxford Street had this night cast up nothing but treasure. With no thought of buying, the eye is sportive and generous; it creates; it adorns; it enhances.\n\nA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte \u2013 an image of civilized (and civilizing) leisure.\n\nObserving what is around us and registering errant impressions is a state not so much of passive inaction as of alert receptivity. Allowing ourselves to notice, to be open to our surroundings, is a way of awakening our curiosity in the world outside ourselves. The philosophical school of phenomenology was based on the idea that knowledge is derived from sensory perception. Such perception is a primary state of consciousness; but even so, it is highly complex. In order to perceive anything \u2013 to see the room we are in as a room, for example \u2013 the brain has to coordinate several neuronal strands: visual, auditory, spatial. How that is done \u2013 how such coordination adds up to instant and seamless perception \u2013 is still one of the central mysteries of conscious awarenesss.\n\nBut we do know that the brain changes throughout our lives, and is modified by external experience. It is through registering impressions of our surroundings that we add to the storehouse of our internal experience \u2013 the imagery we carry within ourselves, but also our memories.\n\nWe are, first of all, sentient creatures. Our primary perceptions and impressions are part of what we are; but in order to be open to such impressions, we need sometimes to slow down, and turn our attention outwards \u2013 to look. When we are rushing to the tube, we don\u2019t really see the people we are passing, or, say, a new flower stand. Of course, sometimes (or rather, often) we need to rush to the tube. But we also need times of unstrained idleness in which we can meander spontaneously, and be alert and curious about our surroundings. This is a way of enriching our repertory of memories and textures of perception, and of reminding ourselves that there is pleasure in being sentient and alive.",

If we are not to lose track of who we are or what we want, we need occasionally to look into that realm and examine what we find there; to catch up on what has happened to us in the last week or month, and how we feel about it; to sense the conflicts or tensions which may have accumulated while we have been absorbed in daily activity, and try to understand where they come from, and what they mean to us. In other words, we need to give some time not only to idle rumination, but to more strenuous self-investigation and introspection \u2013 to the cultivation of self-knowledge.\n\nWhy is it important to do so? On one level, self-knowledge is a self-evident good, one of the foundations of philosophy and the hallmarks of civilization. The capacity not only to exist, but to understand ourselves, is what makes us fully human, rather than purely animal or biological beings. The motto \u2018Know thyself\u2019 was apparently one of the Delphic maxims inscribed in the Temple of Apollo; its origins were ascribed to any number of early philosophers, and Plato has Socrates use it as one of the central injunctions in his Dialogues. For as long as we have been conscious beings, we have tried to understand who we are, how to live the good life, and where we fit into the larger scheme of things \u2013 the known world around us, and the universe which remained for much of history almost entirely unknown. And, from early on, cultures and religions developed various techniques and practices of self-examination. Socrates tried to further knowledge and self-knowledge through dynamic dialogue \u2013 asking his interlocutors questions about such matters as love, or friendship, or the nature of politics, and encouraging them to press their questioning further, until they understood the very essence and the widest implications of the subjects or problems they were examining. Buddhist meditation developed the practice of sitting still for prolonged periods of time and impartially observing what is happening within us \u2013 a technique which, in its Western versions, is once again becoming popular in contemporary cultures. Other religions have asked us to examine our souls in the light of received laws or ideas of sin and salvation.\n\nBut I also want to suggest that if we need to look inwards \u2013 to keep \u2018in touch\u2019 with ourselves, as our contemporary phrase has it \u2013 that is not only because self-knowledge is a virtue, but because its lack diminishes us, and makes us anxious and unhappy. It also \u2013 quite crucially \u2013 prevents us from orienting ourselves in the world, or making well-founded choices, or knowing what we believe or want. Lack of self-knowledge leaves us, internally, in the dark.\n\nMind you, if you consider it for a moment, the very need for deliberate cultivation and attainment of self-understanding can be baffling. Unless we want to study ourselves as physical or biological objects (an important, but not a reflective form of investigation), how can we not know ourselves? How can the thing that is ourselves be opaque or mysterious to the thing we are? And indeed, on one level, self-knowledge is a natural property of our minds, and an aspect of consciousness which is built into the structure of our brains \u2013 that is, self-consciousness. We are the only species endowed with this faculty; that is, the ability not only to see or know something \u2013 to spot a bird, say, or learn a new song \u2013 but to know that we see and know it. And, even as we experience various states of self \u2013 say, anger or sadness \u2013 we know that we are experiencing them. In a sense, we are observing ourselves all the time.\n\nBut on another level, understanding ourselves is not easy or automatic at all. We know that sometimes we are perplexed by very basic questions: what exactly are we up to in our lives, what are our actual desires and aspirations? Are we happy with what we are doing, or do we want, somehow, to change? And we have probably all had moments in which we say awkward things we didn\u2019t mean to utter; or times when we have been overwhelmed by feelings \u2013 anger, shame, or for that matter, love \u2013 we didn\u2019t exactly know we had; or periods during which, say, we drink too much, without exactly wanting or choosing to. Some of us may have experienced not only confusing feelings and impulses, but moments of deeper disorientation. If we rush ceaselessly through disconnected activities without checking in on our moods or motives, we can lose track of ourselves; in a sense, we lose the ability to experience our experiences. A rather high-flying friend, Peter, tells me that he went through a period \u2013 after several months of working, playing and travelling ceaselessly \u2013 when he simply didn\u2019t remember where and who he was when he woke up. Such states are, of course, very disconcerting, and he had to take some time off work in order to regain his bearings and his sense of his normal, grounded identity.\n\nIt seems that in the realm of our inner life, self-knowledge is not a given of our nature, nor easily attained. The practice of self-reflection needs to be developed and nurtured \u2013 and in our age of virtual hyperactivity, this does not come to us easily or naturally. Our very notions of what it means to know ourselves \u2013 or to have an identity \u2013 are being fundamentally altered by digital technologies. In our abbreviated digital communications (whether on Twitter or on Facebook), we present and express the most transitory and superficial aspects of our personalities. We report what we are doing at a particular moment; or give sound-bite versions of an idea or opinion (\u2018I am driving down horrible M21 and hoping to reach Villesville soon\u2019; \u2018That was a great speech at the climate change conference\u2019). We \u2018know\u2019 ourselves through the selfies we take of ourselves, and which give us back the visual surfaces of our activities and selves. This can undoubtedly be fun, and images can function as a memory-aid \u2013 they can remind us where we\u2019ve been, and what we have done. But such reminders of surface impressions are not an equivalent of knowing ourselves in three dimensions; indeed, our addiction to recording our experiences moment by moment may deflect us from our immediate responses and sensations, and prevent us from experiencing the moment in its non-virtual actuality in the first place. (And, incidentally, images can lie very well. In a selfie taken in front of some Greek taverna, we may be smiling toothsomely to indicate we\u2019re having a great time; but in fact, we may be in the middle of an upsetting conflict with our partner, and in a terrible mood.) What we are in danger of losing in our predilection for producing and conveying instantaneous information is the very idea of inwardness, and of understanding ourselves not only in the immediate moment, but through extended time. Accessing that \u2018deep space\u2019 of our internal lives requires a more sustained process of introspection.\n\nHow, then, can we develop the capacity \u2013 and the subtle skills \u2013 of looking inwards? How can we begin to delve into and explore the aspects of ourselves which are not easily reachable, or known? It is of course impossible to be prescriptive about this most individual and delicate of endeavours; but the first step is certainly to turn off our smartphone, and find a place which is free from external distractions, and which allows us to retreat temporarily to the privacy of our thoughts and feelings.\n\nOf course, this may be, to many of us, a discomfiting prospect. When we speak about \u2018threats to privacy\u2019, what we usually mean are the dangers of government or corporate access to our computerized information. But in the meantime, we are all too often willing to give away the most meaningful kind of privacy \u2013 the privacy of our personal and internal experience. In sending intimate disclosures to dozens or hundreds of \u2018friends\u2019 in our network, or \u2018sharing\u2019 images of ourselves in various states of dress or undress, we lose the habit, or the ability, to contain our experiences within ourselves and come to understand them from within. The silence of quiet rumination can seem to us to be a state of frightening emptiness and stasis.\n\nBut self-reflection is hardly equivalent to blankness or cessation of effort. It requires focus and a particular kind of concentration. It also requires intervals of time for the very different kind of temporality which courses within ourselves \u2013 within subjectivity. Internal time does not move in chronological progressions. A thought can arise and develop over an extended period; a glide from the present to the past can happen in a split second. Looking inwards is not a process that can be rushed, or in which we can try to be efficient.\n\nOne experiment in what might be called informal self-analysis has been described in two charming books by the writer and painter Marion Milner, who eventually became a psychoanalyst, and who wrote under the pseudonym Joanna Field. In A Life of One\u2019s Own and An Experiment in Leisure, she tells us that she wants to overcome a sense of confusion in her life, and to discover what really makes her happy or gives her enjoyment. She does so by exploring \u2018the no-man\u2019s land which lay between the dark kingdom of the psychoanalyst and the cultivated domain of my conscious thought\u00a0\u2026 I had not realized that by a few simple tricks of observation I could become aware of quite unexpected things in myself.\u2019\n\nOne of these tricks was to keep herself \u2018particularly alert to any little movements going on in the back of my mind, passing ideas which were often quite irrelevant to my task of the moment\u00a0\u2026 I called these \u201cbutterflies\u201d for they silently fluttered in from nowhere and were gone in a moment.\u2019\n\nSometimes, as Marion Milner discovered, acknowledging such \u2018passing ideas\u2019 requires the courage of honesty \u2013 of facing up to something which may seem incompatible with our self-image, or with what we think should matter to us. In A Life of One\u2019s Own she describes a long reverie, in which she tried to discern what was making her distressed on a particular morning; as she sits on a river bank and allows the rhythm of the flowing water to encourage her own flow of thoughts, she eventually admits to herself that what nags at the back of her mind is an earlier moment when she failed, in conversation with a man she found interesting, to hold his attention. A small admission, seemingly, but one which was difficult for her to make and which gave her great relief once it was made. She could go on to savour the beauty of her surroundings, and enjoy the morning fully without being distracted by an obscure internal discomfort.\n\nMarion Milner went on to study psychoanalysis. But whether we are aware of psychoanalytic theory or not, in our contemporary cultures, it is psychoanalysis, with its many associated therapies, which provides the main model for understanding ourselves in depth, and for the practice of introspection. Psychoanalysis is the discipline that in the last century and a half has given us the most systematic and probing observations of internal life, and the most comprehensive model of the self and its development. Indeed, psychoanalytic theory can be seen as a modern updating of the long philosophic lineage \u2013 a philosophy which adds to the older templates of human nature the element of deep subjectivity. Within the psychoanalytic conception of the self, the \u2018irrational\u2019 aspects of our make-up \u2013 violent emotions, instincts, inchoate impulses, the unconscious \u2013 are seen not as something to be vanquished by the light of rationality, but as basic materials of human identity which have to be taken into account in our understanding of ourselves, and which are a source of significant knowledge and self-knowledge.\n\nSuch assumptions have come to constitute for us, to quote W. H. Auden on Freud, \u2018the climate of opinion\u2019. Psychoanalysis has given us the terms through which to understand ourselves, and sometimes the lenses through which to view the world. (The Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci once said, \u2018I have a third lens in my camera; it\u2019s not Kodak or Zeiss \u2013 it\u2019s Freud.\u2019) As we embark on the project of self-examination, it might be useful to keep some of the insights and techniques of depth-therapies in mind \u2013 although we certainly don\u2019t need to be theoretical about ourselves, or to think through a theoretical vocabulary. We might, initially, give ourselves over to the state which Milner discovered for herself, and which therapists call reverie or free association: a kind of non-judgemental attention in which we allow images, memories or indiscriminate associations to float to the surface of our minds, and stop ourselves from fending them off, no matter how insignificant they may seem. We need, in a way, to be open to ourselves and to what we discover within \u2013 and to discover it in our own words and ways.\n\nWhat we find there will undoubtedly be very specific, and perhaps surprising even to ourselves. When I was studying psychoanalysis, I was struck by the great variety and singularity of people\u2019s inner lives. I remember, for example, a woman who could not fall asleep when the street outside was quiet, because the noises of life reassured her that she would not disappear while she slept; that there was something to come back to. There was a young man who worried perennially that he was not thankful enough to people he met; or that he was too stickily thankful. The patterns of psychic life are difficult to generalize; and perhaps the first step in self-examination is to acknowledge those small ways of acting or reacting which are a part of our particular personalities; to notice, for example, when we are pretending to enjoy ourselves at a party without actually doing so, or when we are bothered by a seemingly insignificant exchange with a colleague (did her lip curl in slight scorn, even as she was forcing herself to be respectful about a proposal we made?) and to be honest about why that is.\n\nIt is the distinguishing hallmark of psychoanalysis that \u2013 unlike other theories of self \u2013 it takes such individual traits and quirks seriously. In contrast to traditional philosophies which have seen human nature in the light of general precepts, psychoanalysis started with close observation of particular people, and the often unpredictable patterns and details of their interior lives \u2013 and within its picture of the self, such details matter. Our emotions, thoughts, inner conflicts and passions are the essence of what makes us human \u2013 and our particular passions and stories are what make us the specific individuals we are.\n\nThis is also in interesting contrast to Buddhist meditation, which, in its more extended forms (as opposed to the meditation-lite offered in Mindfulness programmes) provides another model for self-reflection, and one which has often been compared to psychoanalysis. There are indeed affinities between the two practices; but the crucial difference, it seems to me, is in their attitudes to the character of the individual personality and self. Buddhist meditation proceeds from the premise that the world as we know it \u2013 the world of appearances \u2013 is ultimately meaningless and veils a more permanent reality; and that the individual self (which, after all, will be reincarnated as something else after death) is essentially insignificant. Nor are the contents of our inner lives \u2013 thoughts, feelings, fantasies \u2013 of much importance. In meditational sessions, people are instructed to remember that \u2018thoughts are only thoughts; fantasies are only fantasies\u2019 \u2013 and to let them go as if they were cloudy vapour. The aim (at least as it is conveyed in Western versions of meditational philosophy) is to clear our minds of both, and to sense the ephemeral nature of our concerns \u2013 a state which allows for truer and clearer perception of reality. Why worry about that colleague\u2019s curled lip, if we are an ephemeral speck within a transient and ultimately illusory reality?\n\nThere have been eloquent testimonies to the power of meditation, although these usually come from adherents who have retreated for prolonged periods to ashrams or monasteries, or other places devoted exclusively to meditative practices \u2013 who have, in other words, made it a way of life. But others have found that while meditation helps them in sloughing off temporary tensions, it does not address or resolve the actual conflicts or stresses which accumulate so easily in our societies \u2013 however small they may seem in the larger scheme of things.\n\nOf course worrying about someone\u2019s ambiguous gesture of disapproval can be overdone. But if such things nag at us, if an errant expression surfaces with a disturbing clarity before we go to sleep, that may be because for us it may have significance, and hold clues to some deeper, or more important concerns \u2013 say, an excessive fear of rejection, or a sense of one\u2019s own inadequacy. Within the psychoanalytic conception of the self, such oddities of feeling and quirks of personality are seen as important; and the aim is not to dispel them by declaring their insignificance, but to address them and understand them in all their dimensions. In formal depth-therapy, a small symptom (repeatedly forgetting the keys to one\u2019s apartment, say) or an odd reaction which has assumed a disproportionate importance in the account of a person\u2019s week (the patient was annoyed rather than sympathetic to a friend who was ill) is pursued through associations, or interpretation, to what may be their deeper or un-acknowledged sources in the patient\u2019s psychic life \u2013 so that eventually, the underlying causes of surface difficulties can hopefully be grasped and resolved.\n\nAt the same time, psychoanalysis offers powerful suggestions as to why self-knowledge is so difficult to attain. This is not because we are insufficiently clever or incapable of rigorous ratiocinative thought about the world; or because we live in a perceptual cave, where true reality is veiled from our eyes. Rather, it is because we ourselves are hidden from ourselves; because some of the forces which drive us and impel our sensations and feelings are not fully known to us. They are, in fact, unconscious.\n\nIn Freud\u2019s first formulations, parts of our internal life become inaccessible to us because of the mechanisms of repression \u2013 because certain feelings or impulses (in his hypothesis, these were mostly sexual) are so intolerable in some circumstances that they have to be \u2018forgotten\u2019, or hidden out of consciousness. Freud\u2019s first patients suffered from such florid symptoms as paralysis without any physiological cause, or the inability to speak in one\u2019s native language, or coughing unstoppably when certain subjects or memories were touched on. The work of psychoanalysis was to help patients bring the repressed feelings masked by such symptoms to the surface \u2013 to become conscious of them; and this was often a very painful process.\n\nThe lack of self-knowledge, on this level, can lead to illness and emotional paralysis; and sometimes to wasted lives. The effort of self-knowledge is not only ennobling, but necessary to our happiness and health. In our time, as many contemporary psychoanalysts have noted, the failure to understand what is going on within ourselves is likely to come not from repression, but from the scattering and fragmentation of our internal lives \u2013 the inability to figure out the connections between our disparate activities, or even to remember them, or to give them personal meaning. This of course mirrors the fragmentation of our external lives, and is greatly exacerbated by digital technologies and the scattering of attention \u2013 of mind and feeling \u2013 they encourage.\n\nFreud\u2019s couch \u2013 an icon of psychoanalysis, and of deep self-investigation.\n\nNone of this is an argument for studying psychoanalysis or entering formal psychotherapy; but it makes the need for periods of self-examination more urgent. If we want to avoid states of stress or disorientation so easily induced by our lifestyles, we need to gather the fragments of our experience together, and to make sense of their meanings to us \u2013 perhaps before passing problems or worries become more deeply and perplexingly embedded in our emotional lives, and turn into more distressing states of inner disorientation or mysterious anxiety. What do we feel \u2013 and think \u2013 about what has happened to us during the previous week or month? Why does a particular incident we didn\u2019t have time to think about continue to worry us? What does it touch off in ourselves that gives it importance out of its actual proportion? In order to track down the significance of such details to their sources in ourselves, we may need to move from states of reverie to a more strenuous exploration of our inner lives.\n\nInsight can catch us unawares in almost any situation \u2013 as we are taking a bath, or boarding a bus \u2013 and such small epiphanies can constitute clues to our particular predispositions and personalities. But aside from passing perceptions or sensations, our inner lives are also affected by pressures or conflicts which are more deeply and more stubbornly embedded in the structure of our subjectivity. In order to understand those, we need not only to be receptive to the errant impressions or associations which surface from our minds, but to think about them in a more focused and concentrated way. By \u2018thinking\u2019 here, I do not mean the activity of abstract reasoning; but rather, a process that absorbs the whole self, and that takes into account those elusive entities called emotions as well as impersonal or broader ideas. Contemporary psychoanalysts refer to \u2018the space to think\u2019 \u2013 a non-chartable terrain which includes all of our affective and ratiocinative capacities \u2013 and it is that elusive but crucial territory that we need both to open up and to traverse if we want to become conscious of what is going on within us. We need to think inwards, and to think from within.\n\nWhat we discover through such explorations may be, initially, quite disconcerting. The deep space of subjectivity can be a turbulent realm, full of feelings we would rather not have \u2013 anger, shame, guilt, envy, vulnerability, dread of death \u2013 and that we are loath to acknowledge. But such acknowledgement can bring great relief: the relief of clarity. If we understand our proclivities to anger, say, we may not succumb so easily to irrational fits of fury, ostensibly provoked by small daily conflicts (or because someone snatched our taxi or parking space) but actually fuelled by, say, feeling inadequately appreciated or loved; we may not be overtaken by an onset of sudden anxiety on the way from a meeting, which actually masks a sense of sadness and loss of safety caused by a close person\u2019s death. We may be less in the dark.\n\nHere is Marion Milner again, as she progressed further in her experiment in self-knowledge: \u2018And it was gradually, by exploring this region,\u2019 she writes, referring to something like subjective space, \u2018that I came to understand what forces were distorting and limiting my powers of perception, preventing me from making constant use of that source of happiness which my earlier observations had brought to light.\u2019\n\nEmma, who has made a habit of making \u2018the space to think\u2019 in her life in order to counter the sense of being perpetually scattered, has found that systematic introspection can make her better acquainted with the distorting forces in herself, and lead her to salutary insight. \u2018After a while, I can see what\u2019s being played out,\u2019 she says. \u2018Or what I\u2019m playing out.\u2019 For example, after examining some very odd reactions to her friends and colleagues, she began to realize how envious she was of many of her professional and even personal contacts. Emma is a highly ethical person; and she doesn\u2019t believe that professional success, or high salaries, or a friend\u2019s attractiveness, are important enough to warrant envy. And yet, she had to admit that envy was what she felt, and that it was a troubling sensation \u2013 partly because it was so dissonant with her self-image and values. It was only after she confronted this sensation head-on and circled around its causes (her own dissatisfaction with herself; her father\u2019s early preference for her younger sibling) that this complex feeling began to lift. Although the process of arriving at this realization was difficult, there was great pleasure for her in reaching new and deeper understanding \u2013 as well as in gaining control over troubling emotions. Understanding is its own reward; when Emma reached it, she found she went to work in a happier mood, and stopped being unnecessarily suspicious of her occasionally more successful colleagues. As an incidental bonus, this made her a nicer and more effective colleague herself, and led to a small promotion. Inner conflict can hamper us greatly, and its resolutions can open up unexpected vistas.\n\nIndeed, arriving at new levels of understanding is, I think, one of the great underestimated pleasures of our mental life. Remaining at the surface of our experience can make us feel scattered and trivial; delving down and becoming conscious of what is within can give us a sense of clarity and internal enlargement \u2013 an almost literal deepening of perception. It also means we are less at the mercy of obscure emotions, and can draw on our inner energies more directly.\n\nFreud\u2019s formulation for this kind of self-discovery was, \u2018Where id was, there shall ego be.\u2019 A more contemporary formulation of a similar idea comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the life sciences, especially neuroscience \u2013 the field in which the nature of consciousness and emotions is investigated not only speculatively, but through microscopic probes into the body and brain. On one level, students of evolutionary biology have identified several \u2018universal emotions\u2019 \u2013 fear, anger, sadness, happiness, disgust and surprise \u2013 which are the body\u2019s instinctive reactions to the realities we encounter in our environment (danger stimulates fear, rotten meat disgust, etc.). But cutting-edge research in neuroscience suggests that the more subtle and specific feelings we experience are created by a feedback loop between body and brain; that is, between our physiological reactions and that still mysterious entity called consciousness. Here is Antonio Damasio, a leading neuroscientist with a distinctly philosophical bent, on the processes which go into the making of emotion:\n\nBody and brain are engaged in a continuous interactive dance. Thoughts implemented in the brain can induce emotional states that are implemented in the body, while the body can change the brain\u2019s landscape and thus the substrate for thoughts. The brain states, which correspond to certain mental states, cause particular body states to occur; body states are then mapped in the brain and incorporated into the ongoing mental states. A small alteration on the brain side of the system can have major consequences for the body state (think of the release of any hormone); likewise, a small change on the body side (think of a broken tooth filling) can have a major effect on the mind once the change is mapped and perceived as acute pain.\n\nThis is important, in part because it confirms with empirical precision what our experience so often tells us: that our minds are not disconnected from our moods, and that what we think is an intrinsic part of how we feel \u2013 and vice versa. Emotions are not only physiological currents of bad or good sensation that rise up within our bodies; they have meanings, and they proceed from the meanings we give to our experience. Indeed, the ability \u2013 and the need \u2013 to endow our experiences with significance is what makes us deeply human. In his book Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl, an existential psychoanalyst who was also a concentration camp survivor, suggests that even great suffering can be borne if we understand its meanings. On the other hand, even small doses of stress or unhappiness can drive us to antidepressants if we move through such states in a fog of disorientation.\n\nIn a way, the two leading modern theories of self \u2013 psychoanalysis and neuroscience \u2013 have gone some way to heal the split (which has never existed in our experience, but was inscribed into our \u2018rationalist\u2019 traditions of belief and thought) between irrational impulse and the \u2018higher faculties\u2019 of rational thought, or between body and mind. Both contemporary models of consciousness tell us that meaningful self-knowledge is knowledge that proceeds from our whole selves, and takes the whole self into account. In order to understand we need not only to think, but to think feelingly.\n\nIntrospective Memory\n\nIt is important to make sense of our experience in the present; but if we are not to risk another kind of fragmentation, we need to traverse \u2018the space to think\u2019 not only through its emotional strata but through layers of time. In our hyperactive lives, and particularly in our transactions with digital technologies, our experiences are all too often curtailed to the abbreviated moment \u2013 the minute it takes to send an SMS, or the few seconds to read a message on Twitter. By now, we have enough evidence to know that such habitual focus on the instantaneous moment diminishes cognitive memory \u2013 the capacity for recall of facts, events and people. But perhaps just as significantly, in the contraction of perception to the immediate moment, we risk losing not only the dimension of depth but of continuity \u2013 an understanding of the links between our personal past and present, of where we\u2019ve been, what has formed us, how we have changed through time and where we may want to go.\n\nBoth kinds of memory are crucial to our sense of self. We are the only sentient creatures who have autobiographical memory \u2013 that is, we not only remember where we were, for example, a year ago on vacation (some animals can return to the same places on their migrations), but also the experience of ourselves being there and knowing we were the same person. Without such memory \u2013 and without a sense of continuity between our personal past and present \u2013 we would literally lose a sense of self.\n\nOn the neurological level, this is illustrated in dramatic and poignant cases of people who suffer from massive loss of memory, through Alzheimer\u2019s, for example, or brain injury. In one of his studies, \u2018The Lost Mariner\u2019, the neuro-psychiatrist Oliver Sacks describes the case of Jimmie, who suffered from a brain injury which eliminated his ability to remember anything after his accident. Jimmy literally did not remember who he was \u2013 or who his doctor was \u2013 from one moment to another. If he left the room and returned immediately, he did not remember having been there a minute before, or recognize himself as the same person. This, of course, is a very extreme example, but it highlights the deep connections between memory and identity, and the importance of following what Richard Wollheim, in a wonderfully interesting book by that title, called \u2018the thread of life\u2019.\n\nThat thread leads us not only through the external facts of our past (when we graduated, got married, divorced), but through the internalized history we carry within ourselves. In this more elusive realm, memory does not follow straight lines or chronological laws, and in order to make sense of it, we need sometimes to allow ourselves to meander through it; to let an image from the far past surface from within our minds, or to follow an unexpected leap between an event that happened, say, in our adolescence, and one closer to the present \u2013 and to muse on the meanings of such connections.\n\nTravelling over our subjective history can also help us understand ourselves in context: to think about the background that formed us, the personalities of the people who have been important to us, the influence of our education, or how our tastes, ideas and predilections may have changed. Psychoanalysts as well as philosophers sometimes talk of \u2018the narrative self\u2019 \u2013 the identity we construct through putting together both our external and our internalized stories; and we need from time to time to update ourselves on that narrative \u2013 to catch up with ourselves.\n\nThe \u2018deep narrative\u2019 we discover within ourselves can alter considerably as our perspective, or our views, or indeed the configuration of our internal lives change. Emma, for example, revised some of her early memories of her sister, once she understood her own envious feelings towards her, and she became less suspicious towards her younger sibling \u2013 and indeed, towards others in her environment. She wasn\u2019t remembering different things, but she was remembering \u2013 and interpreting \u2013 them differently; and this gave her the sense that she had developed and grown, that her understanding of the world and of herself had deepened.\n\nUnderstanding ourselves over time, rather than moment by moment, can help us gain a sense of inner coherence and continuity \u2013 and such continuity counts for a lot in our discontinuous lives. Memory helps ground us within ourselves, and to experience both the past and the present more intensely and richly.\n\nA diary can give you back a candid record of your outer and inner past.\n\nKeeping a Diary\n\nKeeping a diary belongs to a category somewhere between leisurely reflection and active mental effort. There are of course two kinds of diary. One is used to keep a simple record of the owner\u2019s appointments and activities, dinner parties and doctor\u2019s appointments. This has its uses, if only to remind us that we have been present in the past, and have done things we might otherwise have forgotten entirely. It helps us follow a sequence of events in our lives, and gives to the past a concrete reality which can be both surprising and reassuring.\n\nBut it is the other kind of diary, in which we listen to our thoughts and jot them down as they come, that is valuable as a form of deeply private reflection, and an aid to understanding the deep and long narrative of our experience. That kind of journal probably belongs most comfortably to the era of handwriting, and pleasing pen and paper. The movements of the hand as it writes apparently follow and reflect the movements of our minds, while writing on the computer too incessantly can give us carpal tunnel syndrome. But while there is added tactile pleasure in a nicely bound notebook and a precise pen, it is nevertheless possible to keep a diary on a computer as well, if we can create a space for the kind of privacy it requires (and if we can resist looking at those emails while we do it). Spontaneity and uncensored observation and self-observation are of course the key to diary-writing, and part of its enjoyment.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to spend a lot of time on keeping a journal \u2013 fifteen minutes, say, over a coffee after work is enough if we do it consistently \u2013 but developing the diary habit is especially valuable in the age of the crowd-sourced, crowd-publicized self. A private journal gives us a very different kind of self-portrait than any number of selfies or Facebook postings.\n\nMarion Milner found keeping a diary extremely fruitful as she embarked on her project of self-examination. It helped her pin down her errant and sometimes vague thoughts, and make them real. It helped her to know what she actually felt and thought. Anne Frank, in her time of terrible trial, thought of her diary as her \u2018friend\u2019, and she wrote in it as if to a close intimate. Anne was an adolescent in the period when she and her family were confined and hiding in her Amsterdam attic, and the diary helped her discover new aspects of herself (including an unembarrassed eroticism, and a wicked talent for observing the foibles of others).\n\nBut for all of us, a diary can be a way of discovering as well as expressing our individual temperament, and it can give us a very particular and sometimes surprising portrait of our own personality and sensibility. \u2018Is this what I\u2019m like?\u2019 we sometimes feel, as we re-read a sentence and an unexpected insight or observation comes upon us. This echoes Freud\u2019s foundational insight about the importance of articulating our experience in words \u2013 in the case of his patients, to excavate concealed memories, or to interpret disturbing sensations. But for all of us, articulation heightens clarity, and sharpens both our feelings and our perceptions. A diary is a way of conducting a most confidential and candid conversation with ourselves; and the very act of recording such conversation can give our inchoate feelings and musings a reassuring and more vivid reality.\n\nAnd if we keep a diary over a long period of time, it can give us back our true personal history. We can look back at our journals and see not only what has happened in our lives, but the changes and the continuities within us: in our emotional pitch towards the world, our feelings towards specific people, and not least, our ideas or broader attitudes. Like other forms of reflection, this can also make us more cognizant of who we are, and anchor us more firmly in our experience.",

But our mental and imaginative resources would soon be exhausted if they were not replenished by looking outwards, and engaging imaginatively with the external world. Our minds and selves need nourishment, as much as our bodies; and if leisure has sometimes been seen as the foundation of culture, it is because it allows for the cultivation not only of self-knowledge, but of what might be called non-instrumental knowledge and non-productive aspects of the self: a disinterested curiosity, the capacity for aesthetic appreciation, the need for wonder. If we are to remain internally and intellectually alive, we need to make time not only for introspection but for imaginative exploration \u2013 for following our intellectual predilections, say, or our aesthetic impulses, without keeping an eye on the outcome or the specific goal. In a way, we need to remember that such activities are hardly superfluous; and that we need to give time to them not because they are worthy or improving, but because they enlarge our perceptions and understanding of the world, and nurture those parts of the self from which we perceive and understand.\n\nReading\n\nWe all know that reading is a good thing. There is no need to promote it as a fully approved activity, something that a self-respecting educated person should do as much of as possible.\n\nBut why, exactly, is it such a good thing \u2013 what do we read for? This may seem like an odd question to ask, but it needs to be posed if only because reading in the age of hyperactivity raises new questions and problems. For one thing, the very form of the book and the time required to read can seem incompatible with the digital time in which we spend so much of our lives. Our coexistence with digital devices has affected our patience and shortened the span of our attention \u2013 which often does not extend beyond the abbreviated forms of internet communication. At the same time, the problems of choice can be as daunting in our dealings with books as with other, less worthy commodities. The sheer number of books produced each year and available to us in various formats can overwhelm our ability to choose and our powers of discrimination.\n\nLike all human activities, reading has its history and its phases, and the twentieth century was perhaps the heroic age of reading. Mastering the literary canon was part of an educated person\u2019s equipment; reading \u2018everything\u2019 was seen as a powerful, almost an athletic achievement. Jean-Paul Sartre, in his wonderful memoir The Words, describes a childhood spent almost exclusively among books \u2013 in a Parisian bourgeois household filled with these totemic objects, and dedicated to their worship. (Eventually, this period of extreme sedentary bookishness led him to develop a philosophy of action called existentialism \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.)\n\nMind you, young Sartre had a lot of time on his hands, as we mostly do not. Why read, then? Why should we take the time to sit down with a \u2018long-form\u2019 text (as it is sometimes called, in distinction to those default digital forms) and give it the requisite number of hours? There are several bad or insufficient reasons to do so, and perhaps one of the poorest is \u2018because we should\u2019 \u2013 because we want to be in the swim, to read what \u2018everyone\u2019 is reading, or as a form of high-minded consumerism, or what the writer Tim Parks calls \u2018this business of acquisitiveness and conquest\u2019 \u2013 so that we can tot up the number of titles we have to our credit.\n\nOf course, we may want to read a much-discussed book for perfectly legitimate reasons \u2013 perhaps to find out why it\u2019s important, and if indeed it is; or simply to be part of the wider cultural conversation. It is after all one important role of books to stimulate such conversation, to create common points of reference within specific communities, or the wider society. Books help to create a sense that we live in a shared world, or what some sociologists have called \u2018imagined communities\u2019. But the fundamental reason for taking the time to read is because books (good books, that is; books that matter) are the best aid to extended thought and imaginative reflection we have invented. In our own time, this is particularly important, as an antidote to the segmentation of thought encouraged by digital technologies. Cruising among the infinite quanta of data offered on the internet is fine for finding out information; but the disparate fragments we look at on our various screens rarely cohere into continuous thought, or a deepening of knowledge. For us, it is part of the value added by \u2013 and the importance of \u2013 books that they require us to focus our attention and to slow down our mental time; to follow the thread of thought or argument until new insight or knowledge is reached.\n\nUnlike the flat data of the internet, books are multidimensional; and they engage and nourish all our mental faculties \u2013 our whole selves. There are books that answer the basic impulse of curiosity; and for people of a certain temperament \u2013 or perhaps for all of us, if it isn\u2019t stifled \u2013 intellectual and imaginative curiosity can be as strong as libidinal desire. In various studies of such things, the urge to know has been shown to be deeply ravelled with erotic energies, and following its direction and urgency leads to the best kind of reading. We may want to read a book about the latest discoveries in cosmology, or the latest studies of ant colonies, simply because such things are fascinating, and worth knowing; and because they reawaken our sense of wonder about the world. Or we may want to read a biography of a person we admire, or a history of a period which is of interest to us. Such books not only satisfy our desire for \u2018objective\u2019 knowledge, but they give us a wider personal lens through which to view and understand the world, and our own location within it. They literally broaden our mental horizons and our perspective \u2013 and there is great enjoyment, as well as an intrinsic value, in that.\n\nBut it is imaginative literature \u2013 fiction, memoir, personal essays \u2013 which provides the fewest pragmatic answers to the question \u2018why read\u2019, and gives us the richest reasons. To make a rather sweeping proposition, imaginative literature is the art form most capable of encompassing all dimensions of human experience: the outer and the inner world, specific facts and the elusive textures of consciousness, the stories of individual selves and of the self within culture and society. Unlike factual texts which, at a pinch, can be summarized on Wikipedia, fiction and personal writing cannot be so condensed without losing something of their essence.\n\nReading of this kind cannot be done in a hurry. To enter a very good, or a great book (the latter are admittedly rare, but there are good reasons why we refer to them as classics), is to enter a world: the world created by the text, and the implicit world of the author\u2019s voice, style, sensibility \u2013 indeed, the author\u2019s soul and mind. This takes an initial stretching of the mind, a kind of going out of the imagination into the imaginative landscape of the book we hold in our hands. It is often a good idea to read the beginning of a book especially slowly and attentively; as in exploring a new house or place \u2013 or person \u2013 we need to make an initial effort of orientation and of empathy. Eventually, if we are drawn in, we can have the immensely pleasurable experience of full absorption \u2013 a kind of simultaneous focusing of attention and losing our self-consciousness as we enter the imaginative world of the book.\n\nThe experience of absorption in a book is both very private, and universal. A book whose reputation has lasted has been, and will be, understood by many readers across various periods and languages; it speaks to something about the human situation that apparently transcends, or overarches, historical and cultural differences. But when we open a book we also enter a conversation between ourselves \u2013 a particular reader, with particular responses \u2013 and the text. Plunging into a novel or memoir and becoming absorbed in it calls for a certain receptivity, the willingness to \u2018listen\u2019 attentively to the voice of the author and the minds of others. As we follow the plot of a book, or its logical and emotional argument, it is good to pause occasionally and enter into a dialogue with the voice we\u2019re listening to \u2013 to check on what we\u2019re thinking as we read, or whether an observation or an insight strikes us as true or insufficiently so.\n\nOur literary heritage is so enormous, and the production of new books so constant, that if one wants to give examples of what literature has to offer, one can only be very arbitrary. The writer who has been a lodestar for reflective readers for several centuries is Montaigne; his essays have been used as aids to introspection, and as stimulus to meditation on essential aspects of human experience. He was the first to coin the term \u2018essay\u2019 (\u2018attempt\u2019) \u2013 to describe what he was doing \u2013 and it is a form which perfectly suits his project, which was to observe himself and others without prejudice, and to find out what he felt and thought. In a sense, he is the first modern writer to attempt the individualist route to self-knowledge \u2013 that is, a method of investigation based not on religious precepts or prior philosophical ideas, but on close and uncompromisingly honest self-observation. Perhaps that is the secret of his continual appeal, despite the fact that his style is quite old-fashioned. If his writing retains its immediacy across the centuries, that is because in his essays he gives us the movements of his mind as it explores and circles around a subject, or around itself.\n\nDelving into a book brings us into connection with other worlds and lives.\n\nIn a way, Montaigne was one of the first psychologists, examining himself without preconceptions and without trying to arrive at any dogmatic conclusions. He knew that the human soul (what later came to be called the psyche) is full of \u2018divers passions\u2019, that we are not unitary in our moods or even our deeper inclinations. He understood that pain and loss are inevitable in human lives; and he believed that insight into those emotions can make them bearable. Above all, he believed in moderation. Even virtue, he thought, \u2018becomes vicious, if we embrace it too stringently and with too violent a desire\u2019. Drawing on the classical philosophers, and foreshadowing psychoanalysis, he intimated that the emotions needed to be mastered \u2013 but not stifled or repressed. But he also valued his preferences and his pleasures, which he described without prior moralism or prejudice. He wanted, above all, to preserve his quirky individuality, and the particularity of his temperament and perceptions; and this makes him excellent company, interesting and surprising on every subject. One could do worse than spend some time with him \u2013 most of his essays can be read in less than an hour \u2013 and to remember the pleasures of self-observation, of sensing ourselves as specific personalities with individual predilections and temperament.\n\nMontaigne is a central monument in the literature of self-observation, but since then, the literature of personal essay and memoir has grown large. Before the rise of formal depth-psychology, it was imaginative writing that gave us the richest examinations of human subjectivity. Freud acknowledged as much when he said that poets and writers were his true predecessors.\n\nI still remember the sense of astonishment when I first read Rousseau\u2019s Confessions \u2013 perhaps the first work of what has been called \u2018deep autobiography\u2019. It was written some 100 years before the advent of psychoanalysis, but its insights extend not only to Rousseau\u2019s traits or character, but into the origins of what might be called his neuroses or perversions. Amazingly, he is willing to reveal the irregular nature of his erotic desires \u2013 as a child, he enjoyed being beaten by a woman who adopted him after his mother\u2019s death \u2013 and he understands the influence of his childhood sexuality on his adult behaviour. At the same time, it is his capacity for pleasure \u2013 in nature, in his own perceptions, or simply in his existence in the world \u2013 which makes him so pleasurable to read. \u2018But what did I enjoy when I was alone?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Myself, the whole universe, all that is, all that can be, the entire beauty of the world of sense, the whole imaginable content of the intellectual world\u2026\u2019 In Rousseau\u2019s Confessions, the reader encounters a person exploring his inner life and giving forth his sensibility in all its contradictions. Ultimately it is the intensity with which he embraces experience, and the intensity of his quest to know himself, that underlies his sense of pleasure \u2013 and reading him puts us in touch with the more vivid registers of our feelings and thoughts.\n\nReading creates a sense of human fellowship. It is never (or rarely) a public activity, but in putting us in direct contact with other minds and sensibilities, it is a form of solitude which banishes loneliness. It can offer the consolation of knowing we are not alone, in our pleasures or in our suffering. It is in situations of deprivation that the value of reading \u2013 the deep need for books \u2013 becomes more vividly apparent. This was evident to me, for example, when I met ex-prisoners in Eastern Europe who had been incarcerated for their political convictions. Those who had access to books \u2013 or even remembered the contents of books they had read, and could mull them over in their empty hours \u2013 preserved their sanity and strength much better. Nelson Mandela and his fellow prisoners, labouring in the terrible conditions of an apartheid prison, administered an education to themselves through the books they were allowed to read, and memorized passages from Shakespeare. In Romania I talked to a woman who, in her time of trial, kept reading and re-reading Anna Karenina. This was not because it allowed her to escape into a happier or a more romantic world; quite the contrary. It was because plunging into the novel assured her that human reality was richer than the constricted world she lived in. It was because every sentence in the novel had the quality of truthfulness. It is not easy to describe that quality, except to say that Tolstoy penetrates directly to each character\u2019s inner life. His depictions of the social world his characters inhabit \u2013 their dress and domestic arrangements, the pecking order at social gatherings, their problems with work, but also, their struggles with social issues and ideological beliefs \u2013 give us a vivid sense of another time and culture; but it is his insight into the emotional texture of his characters\u2019 inner worlds \u2013 their motives and desires, their longings and painful conflicts \u2013 that gives the novel an almost three-dimensional sense of depth. Tolstoy follows not only the mercurial flow of his characters\u2019 emotions, but the logic of their consciousness \u2013 their beliefs, their changing aspirations and interpretations of their own experience.\n\nAnna Karenina, like many great novels, shows us the lives of others in three (or actually, many more) dimensions. And this is finally why time given over to reading is time richly repaid. Literature shows us the various possibilities of being human; it increases the range of our understanding and prompts us to reflect on our own lives \u2013 to see them, perhaps, from another, or a broader perspective.\n\nNeuroscientists, who examine consciousness by brain-imaging or analysing neurological connections, talk about certain kinds of perception or sensation called \u2018qualia\u2019, which so far cannot be captured through such investigations \u2013 the still ungraspable qualities of mood or emotion, the valences of pleasure and displeasure, or more delicate mixtures of thought and feeling which cannot be easily categorized. Such elusive qualities of experience are perhaps the unique domain of literature; it is not only what we experience, but how, that literature can capture better and more exactly than any other discipline or form of knowledge. Poetry and fiction give us images of human experience in all their dimensions; and great literature has the power to convince us that the complex inner lives of others are real; that others have suffered, loved and struggled as we do. Reading is not a project of moral improvement, but by broadening our perspective, it can make us less susceptible to the immediate seductions offered by our environment; and in the best-case scenarios, it can enlarge the scope of humane understanding, and of empathy.\n\n\u2018Art is the nearest thing to life\u2019, George Eliot said, referring to the art of fiction in particular. \u2018It is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.\u2019\n\nOur contemporary forms of reading threaten to reduce that amplification. Aside from the fact that overusing digital technologies eventually makes us less mentally agile and more forgetful (as research increasingly shows), the kind of segmented, bite-sized reading we do on the internet fragments and constricts the \u2018space to think\u2019, instead of expanding it; in a sense, it reduces or even rubbishes our mental experience.\n\nOur minds need to roam and stretch, to explore and discover, as our bodies do; and travelling through a long text gives us the scope for extended (perhaps on the neurological as well as imaginative level) mental exploration. But being in contact with rich imaginative worlds also reawakens and stimulates aspects of ourselves which we may forget, or suppress, if we move through our lives too fast: our capacities for reverie, lively curiosity, strenuous thought, deep insight, imagining other minds and lives.\n\nD. H. Lawrence thought that it was better to re-read a great book six times than to read six middling books. Most of us do not have the time to revisit even a favourite masterpiece quite so often; but even if we cannot devote time to reading every evening, it is ultimately more fulfilling to spend, say, six hours a week absorbed in a complex \u2018long-form\u2019 text than to trawl through 600 tweets that leave little or no mark on the mind.\n\nAesthetic Appreciation\n\nOf all the cultural goods available to us today, it is the visual arts which stir our most consumerist instincts. Not to acquire works of art (not many of us can afford to!), but to take tours of \u2018big\u2019 exhibitions, and to look at paintings or other visual artefacts. Museums in big cities are crowded to the gills; retrospectives of painters from Velazquez to Picasso draw airport-density crowds. We rush to exhibitions and rush through them, in part to have seen them \u2013 and perhaps not to miss out on something that everyone else is apparently doing.\n\nIt is hard to object to crowds flocking to museums, or the apparent increase of interest in art. It is part of being a mentally alive person to be aware of our cultural history; and it is one of the benefits of globalization that the artistic heritage of the whole world is available to us through travelling artefacts \u2013 or through our own travels. Indeed, part of the appeal of visiting museums is the seeming ease of absorbing visual knowledge. A painting can be looked at in several seconds; walking through a comprehensive exhibition of an artist\u2019s work, or of an aesthetic movement or period, takes considerably less time than reading a biography or a novel. At the same time, one of the pleasures in moving through galleries of a big museum is that images often contain a lot of information. Before the spread of literacy especially, painting was a way of conveying something about history \u2013 real or mythological \u2013 to people who could not get it from books. The Catholic church certainly understood the value of images in narrating foundational stories; and there is a whole heritage of paintings that tell us something about their period and place, or about changing mores and forms of belief, through portraits of significant figures, or depictions of various kinds of craft and labour, or scenes of marriage or battle.\n\nThis is fine, and can be a wonderfully enjoyable way of adding to our store of knowledge. But perusing paintings for their informational content, or fighting your way through an irritable crowd in order to catch a glimpse of a masterpiece, is not conducive to making contact with a rich image and what it is trying to convey to us \u2013 in other words, to a full aesthetic experience. A more than cursory appreciation of painting requires a focusing and a quieting-down of attention; a kind of mindful looking. To absorb the full meaning of a fully conceived image we need to take in not only the texture of its colours, or its lines and rhythms, but also its inwardness. We need to intuit what kind of vision \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 the artist has brought to the subject. Images come from deep within our psyches (we dream most often in images, after all) \u2013 and they speak to us eloquently. This is perhaps especially true of portraits and self-portraits \u2013 those representations of the human form and condition in its many aspects, from the assertions of power and shrewdness in the portraits of various Renaissance potentates, to states of dreamy reverie and trance in the depictions of (notional) saints, to visions of glamour, eroticism, despair, or modernist anxiety which have accumulated since then. Rembrandt\u2019s portraits of ageing men and women have an almost unbearable poignancy, but at the same time they remind us that ageing and vulnerability also have their human appeal, their inward beauty \u2013 if we only look at them with empathy.\n\nGiving such attention to aesthetic objects is the very essence of a non-instrumental act. It is a useless perceptual gesture, performed entirely for its own sake. And yet, our senses and our minds need the stimulus and refreshment of aesthetic pleasure \u2013 of what used to be called beauty. In the presence of too much ugliness \u2013 which is so copiously available in our world \u2013 we grow dry and discouraged, and less able to take relish in the act of perception, and of being alive. From the Greek philosophers on, beauty has been thought to express some important principles in the universe \u2013 harmonies, or sacred symmetries \u2013 and the love of beauty was seen as close to the love of virtue or truth. (\u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty \u2013 that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\u2019.)\n\nThese days, we do not much talk about beauty, and indeed, a lot of modernist and post-modern art does not in any way conform to its classical definitions or requirements. But our enjoyment of art that violates the classical rules of harmony can also be intense; and the riddle of our need for aesthetic form is being increasingly looked at through the prism of neuroscience, and sometimes, of evolution. Certain landscapes, and painterly representations of them (especially those reminiscent of the African savannah), are thought to be satisfying because they go back to the origins of our evolution, and were conducive to it; the savannah, for example, created a vantage point that protected groups from their enemies, and allowed them to evolve in peace \u2013 and later landscapes which echo such views appeal to that archaic sense of safety. In a neurological analogy to sacred symmetries, the visual arts are thought to be satisfying because they allow us to perceive certain regularities and underlying structures in what is depicted \u2013 and the perception of such regularities is important to our understanding of the world. If we cannot see patterns, we literally cannot see \u2013 cannot understand what is in front of us. There have also been studies which suggest that aesthetic experiences draw on \u2018networked\u2019 perceptual systems \u2013 that they absorb all our senses and mental powers. The best works of art give form to physical sensuality, emotion and conscious perception simultaneously, and they allow us to feel the pleasure of such integration \u2013 of feeling internally unified.\n\nBut surely our sense of beauty is also tied to a sense of attachment. The face of someone we love grows beautiful, as an unloved face doesn\u2019t. The natural and urban landscapes we grew up with remain imbricated with allure, no matter what their character. Many of my friends are baffled by my predilection for the flat, seemingly monotonous Polish landscapes, but for me, they make the strings of aesthetic response vibrate.\n\nOf course, human and natural forms cannot be judged by the same criteria as works of art. But art reminds us that we are attached to the world through our physical perceptions \u2013 through our relish of the textures and colours of our surroundings \u2013 and it also helps us understand that the way we perceive the external world and the human form is informed by our inner vision. Hostility or fear makes the objects of our vision ugly; on the other hand, aesthetic appreciation arises out of an intense appreciation or cherishing \u2013 a way of looking that requires attentiveness and a kind of love.\n\nAesthetic appreciation requires keeping the doors of perception open.\n\nOccasionally, we see faces of people in a museum looking up at a painting, rapt in focused concentration. At its most intense, the act of looking at art offers and induces a kind of total aesthetic experience. It is an act of contemplation, in what might be called the Western mode \u2013 that is, contemplation focused on an object, rather than on the emptiness within. To achieve it, we need to look with both our physical and our inner vision \u2013 to open fully the doors of perception.\n\nMusic\n\n\u2018All art aspires to the condition of music,\u2019 said the nineteenth-century essayist Walter Pater, and of all the arts, music most directly expresses and affects our inner states. It is also an art which happens in real time (as opposed to a book, which we can pick up and put down from day to day); and which moulds both external time and our internal pace and rhythms as we listen to it. The pace of listening to music cannot be forced (as we sometimes can quicken the pace at which we read a book); if we attempt to play an old record twice as fast, we get jarring gobbledygook. Time is the material of music, and part of its meaning; and in order to listen to a musical composition, we have to not only give it the requisite amount of real time, but to submit \u2013 give ourselves over \u2013 to its patterning of tempo and rhythm, its moulding of temporality. I\u2019m speaking here mostly about classical music. Other kinds of music can of course be wonderfully enlivening, sexy, thrilling. But it is the works of the classical repertory which take us through extended stretches of time, and provide the experience of wordless, but often profound reflection.\n\nWhy, or how, music affects us so powerfully is, like all fundamental questions about art and mind, not easily explicable. Undoubtedly, music developed as an extension of the human voice \u2013 a faculty that proceeds from within us, and is most directly tied to emotional self-expression and our moods (try to make your voice sound really cheerful when you\u2019re feeling disappointed or dejected). Music is in part a gestural form, as the voice is; and it can give forth the movements of emotion, which always have a temporal dimension (happiness and sadness have different internal rhythms); and which, as neuroscientists increasingly observe, involve both thought and a physical, inner motion. It is not an etymological coincidence that the word \u2018emotion\u2019 contains within itself the word \u2018motion\u2019.\n\nIt is also possible that music is directly tied to the evolutionary development of language. In a book called The Singing Neanderthals: The Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body, the evolutionary biologist Steven Mithen suggests that musical communication preceded the verbal kind, rather than the other way around. Certainly, babies respond to melodious vocalizations and song long before they learn words and sentences. Indeed, babies respond to sophisticated music as well; and for parents who would keep their infants calm or give them an early injection of high culture, Mozart is the composer of choice. (Perhaps not so incidentally, having Mozart piped in to large dairies also improves the milk yield in cows. Let\u2019s face it, Mozart is good for you!)\n\nIn a way that still cannot be analysed fully, Mozart\u2019s musical language expresses states of sheer delight and deep serenity. Music rarely \u2018says\u2019 anything; but music speaks \u2013 and it is, above all, the language of intensity. It is hard to think of music that is merely tepid; but the language of music can encompass the most dramatic and subtle palette of feeling: tenderness, suppressed fury, madcap joy, gentle melancholy. When you listen to a Beethoven quartet, you can be taken from moods of fierce despair to robust humour, to the calmer movements of thoughtfulness and to serene, sometimes unearthly acceptance. But it is also the special trait of musical language that it can say everything at once, can suggest both grief and joy in the same chord. Chopin\u2019s harmonic progressions can compress within themselves a fierce anger and an almost erotic tenderness. It is that synthesis that music can most fully and powerfully express, and which is part of its profound effect on us.\n\nIf we want to experience the full impact and the deep pleasure of music, we need to pull away from distractions and give ourselves over to the shifts of rhythm or tonality, to the emotional modulations of a composition; and to follow its thread of development, which corresponds to a kind of thinking in sound. A friend who is a neurologist has said to me that he knows he is in a highly anxious state when he cannot become instantly absorbed in music; and he deliberately makes the effort of such immersion in order to calm down and renew his internal energies. Music, more than any other form of artistic expression, can affect and alter the listener\u2019s states: it can induce moods of great calm, or the kind of catharsis that follows a full expression of sadness or sorrow. Great compositions can move us to cry, as paintings rarely do; and often, these are tears of release and consolation. Such responses are apparently cross-cultural; and in studies that ask people to name the emotions they hear in a piece of music, the feelings identified are thoroughly consistent. We know when we\u2019re hearing joy, anger or meditative melancholy.\n\nIn his book Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks hazards a guess that the love of music, which is nearly universal, is akin to \u2018biophilia\u2019; that we have a natural affinity for music, as we have for organic life. Music, in his poignant case studies, heals the worst symptoms of dementia; it helps post-encephalitic patients organize their movements; in cases of severe memory loss, people often remember songs and melodies after everything else is gone. It is as if music has the power to shape and bring into focus our neurological systems, to depict, through its structured motion, the patterns and dynamics of our interior lives.\n\nIt is the power of music that it enacts the drama of feeling \u2013 of \u2018thinking from within\u2019 \u2013 at a depth which is not easily translated into verbal language, but is nevertheless nearly universally recognizable. Music allows us to experience fully and deeply states of mind and feeling that we often keep at bay; and experiencing our inner states clearly and fully \u2013 even if they involve suffering or sadness \u2013 can be more profoundly consoling and cathartic than trying to suppress them.\n\nWe deem the idea of passion to be romantic and sentimental; but listening to music prises open those more intense and sometimes turbulent sensations and emotions which can only be called passionate. Being immersed in the musical language of Bach or Beethoven, Bartok or sometimes even Aretha Franklin, reminds us that we have inner lives which are more than superficial or politely socialized; that we have the potential for powerful feelings and responses; and that if we consign ourselves to functioning only on the surfaces of ourselves we lose rich dimensions of experience, and a measure of our humanity.",

      "content": "## 6.\u00a0\u00a0Contemplative Concentration\n\nThere are forms of leisure which belong somewhere between recreation and non-programmatic contemplation \u2013 or rather, which combine both. Many contemplative activities take place in natural settings, and involve a concentrated attentiveness to the natural world. Following the slow shift from light to dark as the sun sets slowly behind the horizon is a simple form of such contemplation, attuning us to a sense of the world\u2019s beauty and its poignant passing. There are also more formal kinds of natural contemplation: bird-watching is one such pastime, which requires both a training of perception and an exact knowledge of the objects observed. It also requires a patient concentration on creatures the watcher appreciates, and even loves. And it can lead (so I understand from writers\u2019 paeans, and bird-watching devotees) to a full absorption in what one is observing, and a temporary forgetfulness of oneself \u2013 or at least, of the immediate thoughts and worries that usually occupy our minds.\n\nBut among all natural activities, it is fishing \u2013 when it is done for its own sake, rather than as a way of making a living \u2013 which seems to have inspired the greatest number of devotees and of lyrical tributes. I should quickly aver that the closest contact I\u2019ve had with this activity has been to watch people standing patiently on a riverbank with their extended rods plunged into the water \u2013 seemingly perfectly contented, and perfectly absorbed in the act of pure waiting; but the literature such absorption has given rise to testifies to this seemingly quietistic activity\u2019s perception-transforming powers.\n\nThe poet Ted Hughes spent many daytime and night-time hours standing still in rivers, observing their flow and the movements of life under the surface as he was trying to lure fish to his bait \u2013 and he wrote some powerfully meditative poetry capturing such moments (and his observations of nature altogether). Here, however, he describes in straightforward prose the states this patient, focused stillness can induce: \u2018Fishing provides that connection with the whole living world. It gives you the opportunity of being totally immersed, turning back into yourself in a good way. A form of meditation, some form of communion with levels of yourself that are deeper than the ordinary self.\u2019\n\nThe contemplative appeal of fishing undoubtedly has to do with the watery element in which it takes place. Water is the great metaphoric element, its flow reminding us both of the ceaseless movement of time, and of nature\u2019s seemingly endless powers of renewal (although we now know that these too can be exhausted). Rivers in various cultures are mythical and holy, and watching the sea in its hypnotic ebb and flow is something that humans have surely done ever since there has been human consciousness. It is an experience which has always induced both awe and a heightened awareness of our existential situation: the impossibility of holding on to any one moment (\u2018You can\u2019t step in the same river twice\u2019 was Heraclitus\u2019 perpetually relevant summary of this condition); our smallness in relation to nature and the cosmos, and the inevitability of death. In other words, contemplation of this primal element and force takes us temporarily beyond the limits of our individual personalities. It can induce those states in which the boundaries between ourselves and the world briefly dissolve \u2013 in which we simultaneously lose our self-consciousness and, paradoxically, feel the coherence and wholeness of all our faculties. It is no wonder that experiences which involve the loss of boundaries and a sense of melding with something outside ourselves (another person, music, nature) are sometimes referred to (by Freud, among others) as \u2018the oceanic feeling\u2019.\n\nContemplating the ocean puts us in touch with our finitude.\n\nLike aesthetic appreciation, these experiences of concentrated immersion in nature are non-instrumental and unprofitable. (Of course, nature pastimes may carry the extra benefit of exercise; though if they are undertaken for the sake of toning one\u2019s muscles, then the contemplative spirit is lost.) But spending some time in proximity to nature is not only pleasurable but beneficial to our physical and mental health. It has been shown, for example, that people in big cities suffer less anxiety if they can spend some time each day in green space.\n\nWe need contact with nature for our well-being, possibly because we are attuned to the natural world and its underlying structures through the structures of our nerves and genes. We are drawn to living forms, in what has been called biophilia. If nature seems to us compelling and beautiful \u2013 if we are drawn to it with a kind of yearning \u2013 that may be because we are in some way made of the same kinds of materials. At the same time, we are not purely natural \u2013 we are human, and we live with our particular characters, inner lives and problems. If we spend too much time merging with nature (or with anything else, for that matter, like hallucinogenic drugs) we may take leave of our senses, and our individuality, for good.\n\nBut clearing a space for intervals of contemplative observation and concentration can help us still the mental noise and tensions of our daily lives, and restore a sense of perspective and distance from our immediate anxieties and preoccupations. Such moments can replenish our perceptions and our sense of wonder, and help us return to our daily lives feeling calmer and more vividly alive.",

      "content": "## 7.\u00a0\u00a0Choosing from Within\n\nWhat is self-knowledge, and self-cultivation, for? As you consider the various forms of leisure described above, you might perhaps wonder whether what is being advocated is merely a form of self-indulgence or, worse still, navel-gazing. And indeed, it might become that \u2013 if it is carried to excess, or if it stops with treating ourselves to feasts of emotional self-awareness. But the importance of self-knowledge has always been that it helps us in choosing how to live. This is in a way the major task of any conscious life, and it has never been easy; but it is made particularly difficult by certain features of our lives and our societies, and it is worthwhile to pause and consider why that is \u2013 and how to bring the processes of self-knowledge to bear on the daily dilemmas of choice, and the long-term conduct of our lives.\n\nIf we find making choices so difficult, that is partly because we have so many of them, and because it is so easy to make them impulsively and thoughtlessly. In an interesting book called The Challenge of Affluence, the sociologist Avner Offer analyses the paradoxical problems caused by the abundance and novelty constantly on offer (and on show) in our prosperous Western societies. \u2018Affluence breeds impatience,\u2019 he writes, \u2018and impatience undermines well-being.\u2019 By impatience, he means the inability \u2013 or the unwillingness \u2013 to postpone immediate gratification. Why deprive ourselves of a lovely leather bag beckoning us from a shop window? Why spend the evening studying for a distant degree, when we could be going to a party? Why, in fact, resist the impulse to jump into bed with someone we met on Tinder, in the service of protecting a relationship which is just developing and uncertain?\n\nImpatience, and the temptation to make impulsive, instantaneous choices in our daily lives, is of course greatly increased by our habituation to the rhythms of digital technologies, and the response we get from them, at a click of a mouse or a keyboard button. And following a pleasurable impulse is sometimes fine and perfectly enjoyable; but if we habitually give in to instant stimulus (of goods, or food, or sex), we may in fact achieve not gratification or pleasure, but regret \u2013 and consequences which can be quite unpleasant (frequent hangovers or unnecessary bank-debt may be among them). If we are to make good choices \u2013 and choices which are good for us \u2013 we need to distinguish what is meaningful from what is trivial, to differentiate between momentary pleasures, and our long-term aims and purposes.\n\nOn that more essential level, the process of making decisions is complicated not only by the problems of plenitude, but by an exceptional degree of individual freedom we enjoy \u2013 and struggle with \u2013 in our lives. In our contemporary, open, diverse societies, we are in principle (if not always in actual circumstances) free not only to follow our consumer preferences but, in most areas of our lives, to do pretty much what we want and as we like. We can choose the careers we want to follow, the lifestyles we want to adopt, whether to have children and in what manner to conceive them, the sex of our partners \u2013 and sometimes our own. At the same time, there have been very few societies which have offered their members so few shared codes of behaviour or assumptions about what is right or wrong, desirable or forbidden, to guide or restrict their decisions. We can choose our values, just as we choose our consumer preferences.\n\nThe temptations of plenitude and the problems of freedom extend not only to inanimate goods, but to human beings \u2013 and to our most intimate relationships. If there are so many potential partners out there, why settle on one? And how on earth do we decide whether he or she is \u2018the right one\u2019? In her book Why Love Hurts, a thought-provoking analysis of this problem, the sociologist Eva Illouz talks to men who leave what may seem like perfectly satisfactory relationships, out of some vague sense that somewhere out there, there may be something or someone better \u2013 someone more exciting, more compatible, or altogether less imperfect than the partners they have discarded. There are no social codes to stop them; no great opprobrium attached to serial relationships, or even infidelity; and no absolute imperative to maintain lifelong monogamy. The situation, in this respect, is somewhat different for women, who have the biological clock to contend with. But to a large extent, for women as well as for men, the easy possibility of changing partners often leads not to pleasurable hedonism, but to ambivalence and inner conflict.\n\nOf course, there are limits our societies place on our behaviour towards others; but short of criminal transgressions, our choices, in the essential areas of life, really are individual \u2013 what we do is up to us. This is a form of personal liberty few of us would want to give up, but the lack of guiding codes for behaviour creates its own difficulties and uncertainties. It also means that the need to reflect on what we want to do, to arrive at our decisions thoughtfully, is all the greater.\n\nTo return to my rather driven friend, Peter: let\u2019s imagine that he has had an offer of a high-powered job abroad; a job which would be gratifying to his ambition, but which would be very stressful and take him away from his friends, his home, his familiar and well-loved surroundings. Peter is lucky to live in a society in which such options are open to him, but he is not without ambivalence about this offer. In the absence of all external constraints, how is he supposed to arrive at his decision? On the basis of what principles or criteria?\n\nOne method of doing so, practised by many people, is to make a list of pros and cons of the new job, and to weigh them against each other. A person favouring this method of decision-making might put, say, better salary, new challenges, getting away from the boss, adventure on the \u2018pro\u2019 side of the equation, and terrible climate, political violence, leaving a promising relationship, uncertainty about long-term prospects on the other.\n\nMaking decisions on the basis of such calculations is one version of what is called rational choice: that is, choice made, supposedly, in the service of our own best interests. But it turns out that ascertaining what those interests are in the first place, and following the dictates of pure reason in trying to attain them, is not at all simple. Even in the area of personal finance, where one might think the criteria for choice are simple \u2013 we want to make optimal profits from our investments \u2013 our decision-making is often driven by needs which are quite \u2018irrational\u2019. There is the problem of excessive impulsiveness, in this area as in others, or of being driven by wishful thinking and unfounded hope. One instance of this was detailed in a long and poignant account by David Denby, the smart and sceptical film critic for the New Yorker, in which he described his obsessive quest to make a million dollars during the economic bubble of the late 1990s \u2013 in the course of which he lost a sizeable amount of money he could not afford. Denby fortunately had professional and other resources to draw on once the bubble of his fantasy had burst; but for others, the consequences of such wishful, or magical, thinking can be more destructive.\n\nIn Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, divides human consciousness into \u2018System 1\u2019 \u2013 which produces our instant and involuntary perceptions, such as recognition of colours or words written in our language, and which may lead us, for example, to stop at a red traffic light without pausing to think about it \u2013 and \u2018System 2\u2019, which includes more complex processes of thought, and may lead us, say, to consider why traffic rules are necessary, and how they could be improved. On the basis of many precise studies, Kahneman argues that making decisions according to the subliminal system of perceptions and intuitions often works better than bringing rational considerations to them. This is partly because we are so bad at making rational predictions \u2013 at taking into account, for example, statistics on the success of investments and the causes of such success \u2013 and therefore we might as well follow our hunches as to whether we like a product or an idea on offer.\n\nThat is all very well when applied to simple, one-off choices: I will invest in this/I will not invest in this. Indeed, if we wanted to be coldly rational about making such decisions, we would probably entrust them to a computer and think about them no more. But what about more complex life decisions?\n\nTo follow up on Peter\u2019s not uncommon dilemma: in his case, the \u2018rational\u2019 process of making a list of pros and cons did not yield a convincing answer \u2013 as it wouldn\u2019t for many of us. But perhaps that is because the conception of rationality implied in the notion of rational choice is itself too limited. Arriving at complex life decisions \u2013 decisions which involve not only commodities, but our selves \u2013 cannot be done by statistical calculation, if only because we are not statistically constructed. There are companies that try to devise algorithms which calculate our conscious and unconscious consumer preferences, but this implies a horribly mechanistic idea of what and who we are. If we are not to give in to such a reduced conception of ourselves as we grapple with fundamental choices, we need to bring to bear on them a different and richer understanding of rationality \u2013 that is, an understanding which includes all our powers of consciousness, thoughtfulness and subjectivity. We need not only to compute, but to think feelingly.\n\nThis is where the fuller, more three-dimensional insights we gain through introspection and cultivation of what might be called \u2018deep knowledge\u2019 can come to our aid. For example, Emma, who has had some practice of self-reflection, may bring a different set of considerations to a prospect of a new job abroad. She may, by dint of understanding the sources of her hidden envy, feel less driven by the desire to overleap one of her successful colleagues as she decides whether to accept a seemingly tempting offer. Competitiveness may become a less compelling motive, and she may be able to concentrate more fully on the personal and professional meanings the job has to her. Her father used to work for an international company, and when she was a child she thought this was very glamorous. She\u2019s still drawn to the adventure of living in an unfamiliar country, and exploring its landscapes and culture. This is a motive she doesn\u2019t disapprove of, and she may follow its call. At the same time, as she sits over a cup of coffee and ruminates, she is aware of a kind of anticipatory regret tugging at her as well \u2013 regret at the thought of leaving her nice, comfy flat, and her interesting and lively circle of friends, with whom she communicates so easily. She may not ultimately give in to this homing instinct, but she needs to acknowledge it, to stay with these more difficult or sadder feelings of potential loss for a while as she tries to arrive at her decision.\n\nBut as noted before, Emma thinks of herself as an ethical person; and as she considers the new job, she wonders whether it fits more abstract criteria of what is good or worthwhile. The reading she has done, and her sense of both the possibilities and limits of human action, may inform her thinking about this. The insights garnered from books which have been important to her have seeped into her consciousness, even if she cannot cite specific passages which have influenced her. In concrete terms, she approves of the aims of the company for which she is being recruited \u2013 a charity dedicated to improving business practices in an African country \u2013 even if she needs to find out more about the people running it. But she also feels a nagging worry, which at some point she needs to articulate, that in emphasizing her social consciousness she may be evading responsibilities and loyalties of a more personal kind: to her elderly parents, a friend who is ill and depends upon her help, a man with whom she has begun to be involved. Is her embrace of social responsibility, paradoxically, an easy way out? Is it a way of avoiding the complications of intimacy and close relationships, which she has always found difficult?\n\nThe choice Emma needs to make involves not only self-interest, but ethics; not only considerations of enjoyment, but her beliefs about what is important and meaningful, and what is not. This is a balancing act \u2013 or an act of self-knowledge \u2013 we all have to perform as we try to arrive at important decisions. We need to reckon both with our preferences \u2013 what we like and enjoy \u2013 and our values \u2013 our sense of what is good and worthwhile \u2013 and to integrate our motives with the meanings we ascribe to our actions. We do not often talk about values these days, especially moral ones; they are usually associated with conservative rhetoric, and are not generally seen as a \u2018cool\u2019 concept. And yet, even if we don\u2019t have a shared language of vices or virtues, we seem to be inescapably moral creatures, and our emotions and perhaps even instincts have inescapably moral implications.\n\nThe \u2018realist\u2019 view holds that natural emotions \u2013 those developed through evolution and for evolutionary purposes \u2013 are amoral. We need to fight our enemies for survival, and find the best breeding partners, no matter what their personality traits, in the service of those impersonal \u2018selfish genes\u2019. (Hence the suspicion that the language of morality is sentimental.) But in fact, it turns out that our kinder and gentler emotions are also very much a part of our evolutionary legacy. Aside from fighting enemies, our evolutionary development has depended on the human ability to cooperate and treat each other fairly, to be attached to other members of a group, and take care of each other. Children have a passionate sense of justice, and are often upset if they or others are treated unfairly. Compassion for others, and the impulse to help if we see others in trouble, is expressed early on, and may be built into the structure of the brain. Possibly this happens via the recently discovered \u2018mirror neurons\u2019 \u2013 the neurons which mimic the gestures and facial expressions and moods of our interlocutors, in a kind of physiologically encoded instinct for empathy.\n\nBut in our adult lives, these nascent instincts develop into more considered attitudes and values \u2013 beliefs which direct our responses, and give our emotions particular meanings. In some cultures and circumstances, both Emma\u2019s and Peter\u2019s decisions about whether to accept or reject a new job offer might be made easier by certain shared codes of conduct. There are societies in which ambition and success are primary goods, and in which it would be a no-brainer to accept the offer of a high-powered job; there are others in which ambition is seen as faintly unsavoury, and in which attachment to your family is an overriding emotion and good. If we grew up in Japan, say, we might honour the authority of our parents or our corporation without much questioning, or be prone to a terrible sense of shame if we did not fulfil some of our responsibilities.\n\nThe dilemma facing us in our own relativist cultures is that they offer very few such norms or guidelines for what constitutes good or bad behaviour \u2013 especially in the areas of responsibility and long-term commitment. In most spheres of life, we need to mould and articulate our values through self-examination and informed thoughtfulness. We need to ponder not only what we are like, but who we want to be \u2013 what qualities or attitudes in ourselves we want to affirm, and what we do not admire. In other words, we need to create our own guideposts for important decisions \u2013 our own ethical, as well as emotional, criteria for choice.\n\nBeyond the question of whether the new job meets her moral considerations, Emma wants to figure out how it fits in with her larger or long-term goals \u2013 the sense of purpose which she wants to animate her life. Having an overarching purpose helps us distinguish what is important from what is not, and gives orientation to our thoughts and our actions; but under contemporary conditions, finding such organizing principles for our lives is not at all easy. In a world of multiple possibilities and constant change, how do we settle on one overriding aim? How do we decide whether \u2018settling\u2019 on anything, or committing ourselves to plans or projects that eliminate other possibilities, is desirable \u2013 or good? Isn\u2019t it better \u2013 nobler, even \u2013 to keep ourselves open to new experiences?\n\nIn his wry and insightful memoir A Sense of Direction, the young American writer Gideon Lewis-Kraus tackles just this problem, and comes up with complicated answers. At a loose end in Brooklyn, he moves to Berlin, where he experiences for a while what might be called radical, hedonistic freedom. He meets other expats, most of whom refer to themselves as artists, cruises galleries with them and parties in super-cool clubs till dawn. In other words, he indulges in what should be a succession of pure pleasures; but after a while, the pleasures cease to be pleasurable at all. His lifestyle is depleting, depressing and ultimately boring. He urgently needs to find an activity that will give him a plan and an aim \u2013 what he calls, metaphorically and concretely, a sense of direction. He decides to go on a pilgrimage in Spain, and subsequently in two other countries as well.\n\nPilgrimages undertaken, as in his case, in a secular spirit have become very popular recently, and for good reasons. In conditions of radical freedom, a pilgrimage is a model of a certain kind of purpose. Trekking for days to a destination which once had profound religious meaning, but is now simply a clear goal at the end of a journey, gives Gideon a liberating sense of structure and a daily task which he does not need to question each morning. In a sense, it teaches him the process of making decisions \u2013 of choosing personal aims, and sticking to them. His goal is arbitrary, but it is meaningful to him; and it requires, for the time it lasts, a resolute sense of commitment. Not finishing the pilgrimage, whatever its hardships, would be a betrayal of his sense of self-esteem. (The long hours of silent walking also, not so incidentally, give him time to reflect on his emotional history quite intensely; and eventually to reconcile with his father, with whom he had good reasons to be angry.)\n\nIn our adult lives, we hope to find purposes which last longer than the few weeks of a pilgrimage. For the classical philosophers, such basic aims were found in the quest for self-knowledge itself; or in living temperately and without excessive expectations; or in living virtuously. In our contemporary lives, such guiding principles are not available from the outside. We need to decide on our aspirations from within. But if we do so through a three-dimensional understanding of ourselves, we can endow our choices and actions with significance \u2013 that sense of meaningfulness from which true satisfaction proceeds.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what decision Emma ultimately made about her job. But she needed to give herself the space for thought in order to really know, so to speak, what she was doing, and to attain a kind of cognitive consonance about her decision \u2013 to make not only a well-calculated choice, but one to which she could give her full assent. Once she had given full brief to her motives and reasons, her uncertainty and ambivalence were replaced by a bracing sense of clarity. She knew what she wanted to do.",

The day passed in an odd time-zone \u2013 both very fast, and without any sense of hurry \u2013 as you concentrated on the research for an inventive new company project, had a nice chat with colleagues over lunch and went on to present your findings to a sizeable group of listeners. The project is important to you, and you spoke about it eloquently. A little while ago, all of this would have been difficult and stressful, but on this occasion, you moved through the day\u2019s paces gracefully and alertly, falling into neither lethargy nor anxiety. As you approach your home, looking forward to a pre-dinner drink, you try to identify your state, and after a while you realize what it is: you\u2019re feeling rather pleased with the day; satisfied with what you\u2019ve accomplished and excited about the project\u2019s \u2013 and your own \u2013 prospects. Perhaps, you think, you\u2019re actually feeling\u00a0\u2026 happy.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\nWe humans are integrated systems. Our minds and emotions, our capacity for sensuous relish and aesthetic appreciation, our curiosity about the world and our need for contemplative enchantment, all work in concert and cannot be separated from each other. It is only when we give ourselves a chance to nurture all of our faculties and ways of understanding the world that we can begin to feel ourselves to be rich in internal resources, and to experience richly. And it is when we allow ourselves occasionally to step away from the constant barrage of external stimuli, and orient ourselves within our internal and external landscapes, that we can begin to be motivated from within \u2013 to distinguish our own desires and preferences from the seductions of instant gratification, to discern what matters to us and what we want to discard, to understand what we really value and want \u2013 that is, to make choices which are truly informed, and which we can affirm as ours.\n\nFor this, we need time out. But most of don\u2019t want to remain on idle permanently. We want to use our energies, rather than let them lie fallow; and once we have given ourselves time to renew and deepen our perceptions and selves, we are better able to gather all of our resources and return to more active forms of experience with a full and conscious sense of engagement. I believe such engagement is what most of us desire in our lives, and in this section I will try to describe what it consists of, and some of the forms it can take in our societies today.\n\nWhat is it like, what does it feel like, to be completely involved in something? Perhaps one way to put it is that it involves the ability to bring all of ourselves to an activity or an experience, without scepticism or withholding, and to focus our attention entirely on an object or a task. That requires having all of ourselves at our disposal in the first place, as well as making deliberate decisions about what we choose to do; but it also calls for a kind of self-confidence which allows us to become entirely absorbed in an activity or process of thought, without distraction or ambivalence, and sometimes to the point of \u2018losing ourselves\u2019 within it \u2013 or at least, losing our ordinary self-consciousness.\n\nOne interesting suggestion as to what constitutes pleasurable engagement comes from the unpronounceably named sociologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his theory of \u2018flow\u2019 \u2013 an idea which has been taken up by many others, in various disciplines. In his book, entitled simply Flow, he connects this highly enjoyable state to being entirely absorbed in certain kinds of activities, and he specifies several factors which are necessary to achieving it. The task we are performing needs to be experienced as purposeful and meaningful, so that we embark on it with full willingness; it needs to be challenging enough to keep us on the qui vive, so to speak, and at the edge of our abilities; but it cannot be so demanding that we feel we cannot do it, which only results in frustration. In states of flow, we often lose our sense of ordinary clock-time; a moment might expand as we home in on a detail, or several hours pass as we concentrate on solving a problem.\n\nThe activities which meet the conditions for engagement come in many varieties. Here, I will look at just a few of them.",

      "content": "## 8.\u00a0\u00a0Work\n\nIt is perhaps one of the big changes of the twentieth century that in our contemporary Western societies we no longer have a division between leisured and labouring classes. The great majority of us work. More than that, we largely derive our sense of value and self-worth from work. Even English aristocrats residing in their country seats (however dilapidated these may be) want to be usefully occupied. To be a modern person is to be a worker, whether you are man or woman, driven by necessity or by preference.\n\nAt the same time, our attitudes to work are often ambivalent. Centuries of experience have told us that work is a matter of necessity, something that is imposed on us; a yoke that has to be accepted, but ought to be resisted. And indeed, work is the area of life which most palpably brings us up against the limits of free choice. We can\u2019t always get what we want in the world of jobs, although hopefully we can get at least what we need. Being part of the world of work requires us to accept the limits of our freedom and our egotism.\n\nIn the right conditions, however, work is the area of life that most clearly calls for and meets the criteria for full engagement. For most of us, work is a central source of significance and of purpose. At the day-to-day level, it affords us the energizing pleasures of delimited tasks whose goals are well defined, and, in the best-case scenario, both challenging and achievable.\n\nHow, then, can we become fully engaged in work, even in imperfect circumstances? I am not going to talk here about conditions which are unacceptable \u2013 wrongful dismissal, unjustified inequality of pay, and other social problems which the world of work, more than any other area of life, produces in every society. These are beyond the purview of this book; here, I am concerned with how we might derive from our work all the satisfaction and stimulation it can offer.\n\nPerhaps one of the first steps is to banish what might be called excess ambivalence \u2013 a subliminal sense that, really, we\u2019re not supposed to enjoy work too much, as a matter of principle, or a kind of cultural resistance. In taking on almost any kind of job, we need to bring our full awareness to our decision: to understand what benefits of exploration or meaningful activity a particular occupation can offer us, even if it is not our ideal choice, and what we can bring to it in return. It is also useful to keep in mind that in our current work structures, while we rarely have guarantees of permanence, we don\u2019t have to think of any job we take on as interminable. The older system of lifelong loyalty to an institution had the advantages of security, but it also had the considerable drawbacks of stasis and stifling boredom. The \u2018man in the grey flannel suit\u2019 who year after year sat at the same desk in the same office, going through sheaves of dusty documents, hardly exists any more; for one thing, the dusty documents have been replaced by those clean (if sometimes too addictively compelling) computer files.\n\nThe conditions of work in our society have in many ways improved from the days of the assembly line or deadly office routine. In fact, for many of us, the great secret is that we like to work. That is what sociologists are discovering, as they study our work habits in detail. For example, when employees of a big American company were given options to work part-time, or to take time off, many of them did not accept the offer. This was not mainly for financial reasons, but because many employees \u2013 although they were reluctant to admit it \u2013 found domestic life more stressful and more difficult than their jobs. Such findings are echoed elsewhere. They reflect the fact that time at home, especially for people with families, is fragmented among so many activities: taking children to their various engagements, dealing with accumulated emails, making supper, making sure the kids aren\u2019t watching pornography online, etc. This can create stressful pressures and scattering of attention, and exhausting demands to keep making small and bigger choices. A friend who has growing children and a large circle of friends remarked that work is the most restful thing she can do; finally, she can be in one place at one time, and bring her mind to a concentrated task.\n\nPurposeful concentration is one of the conditions of flow, but in order to achieve it we need to give our assent to the job we are doing, even if we are conscious of its limitations. It helps, also, to know ourselves well enough that we do not overestimate \u2013 or underestimate \u2013 our abilities.\n\nBut if we plunge into a job willingly, and give ourselves over to its demands (without succumbing to those ever-present digital distractions), then we can derive great satisfaction from the structured effort that most work involves: from performing a task to its completion, without the nagging sense that we might be \u2013 or maybe should be \u2013 doing a dozen other things. Whether we are trying to make something or to solve more abstract problems, work presents us with tasks which are by definition useful, and whose aims are delimited and defined. It allows us the luxury of focused attention as we grapple with a problem or process. In that sense, work is an antidote to mental dispersion and fragmentation; and in presenting us with new challenges, many jobs can stretch us to exercise our mental capacities strenuously, and discover in ourselves innovative ways of thinking, or abilities we didn\u2019t quite know we had.\n\nA sense of competence and accomplishment, as well as the adventurousness of tackling new problems, is one of the energizing pleasures that work can offer us. The other is collaboration. Most of us still work in institutions rather than at home, and most jobs require at least occasional collaboration with colleagues, and collective decisions. (Even if we work from home, our activities are addressed to others, and often need their input and contributions.) But there are also forms of endeavour in which collaboration is an intrinsic part of the work process. As anyone who has worked at an architectural office, say, or a newspaper knows, putting together a complicated product or project \u2013 one which calls for disparate skills and parts \u2013 requires a constant and precise level of cooperation. In order for a newspaper (an institution where my main experience of collaborative work comes from) to appear each day, the writer has to deliver the piece, the editor to make sure the piece meets certain standards, the printer to put through each page in time, and hopefully without too many errors. In order for this to happen, each person involved has to contribute their part on time and without demanding special attention or considerations \u2013 at least while the task is being completed. Tempers occasionally flare up, and disagreements break out; but everyone understands that these cannot go on for long \u2013 that the job has to get done, and for the moment, personal concerns have to be put aside.\n\nThe pleasure we take in such collaboration can be great. It is the enjoyment of solidarity \u2013 of working with others towards a particular goal, and achieving something we all value. The relationships involved are not necessarily personal; indeed, they require us to put aside, for the duration of the task, the preferences we may feel for particular colleagues, or our antagonisms. But the solidarity we feel with others is in itself what might be called an impersonal emotion \u2013 a sense of invigorating satisfaction that comes from participating with others in a collective effort, and from knowing that we can count on each other to contribute our part. This implies a kind of impersonal trust in others, as well as in ourselves. We cannot collaborate effectively if we are feeling excessively insecure, or superior to our colleagues.\n\nEven in less collaborative jobs, if we work in the spirit of pure competition, or if we are perennially resentful because we feel we are underestimated, that may prevent us from being absorbed in the content of what we are doing \u2013 and therefore, from enjoying our jobs and doing them well. The instinct for cooperation runs deep, and is built into our evolutionary history. Certainly, animal groups have to achieve a certain degree of cooperation in order to survive; and we humans could not have built our cultures and civilizations through solitary endeavour. At the same time, in our highly competitive and stress-inducing societies, the collaborative impulse is easily undermined. In order to reclaim its pleasures we also need sometimes to step back from the fray, and reckon with internal attitudes. Work requires not only specific skills but emotional self-awareness; and time spent in self-reflection is well repaid in work satisfaction, and perhaps even success.\n\nAdmittedly, I have been talking mostly about middle-class jobs. It is undoubtedly much harder to achieve satisfaction if you work in a factory which produces, say, computer chips in an assembly-line process. Even in such places, though, physical environments are no longer as infernal as they once were, and employees may experience the enjoyment of a task well done as well as the pleasures of sociability and solidarity. In Flow, Csikszentmihalyi describes Joe, who worked all his life as a welder in a Chicago plant where railroad cars were assembled. Joe enjoyed mastering various aspects of the plant\u2019s operations so much that he refused to become foreman, a promotion that would have deprived him of physical involvement in his work.\n\nIt is possible that states of flow are easier to attain in work that draws on physical skills as well as mental ones, and therefore helps us achieve a kind of mind\u2013body integration. Indeed, it should be no surprise to find that many varieties of work not classified as \u2018white-collar\u2019 can be a source of pleasure and satisfaction. Farming can surely be seen as a \u2018holistic\u2019 activity (just think of The Archers), no matter what its physical or, sometimes, economic hardships. Certainly, traditional farmers in parts of the world which have not been subject to full modernization often express a deep attachment to their way of life. In more modernized circumstances, devising or constructing better machine parts, say, can be a high form of craft. Such jobs should, and probably will, become more respected as our physical skills threaten to decline \u2013 not least because of our ever-increasing reliance on the internet \u2013 and as we begin to admire them, sometimes with nostalgia.\n\nWork, above all activities, engages what are sometimes called \u2018social emotions\u2019 \u2013 our need for respect and recognition, but also for cooperation and extending respect to others. Such needs are central to our sense of self, and apparently proceed from regions of our brains involved in the most fundamental emotions. The neurological signals of admiration are as powerful as those involved in the feelings of love. Whatever society we live in, we want to be esteemed by our colleagues and fellow workers \u2013 indeed, by our fellow humans. But in order to be able to experience esteem \u2013 to recognize the recognition, so to speak \u2013 and in order to extend it to others, we need to achieve a kind of internal balance in which we are neither too insecure nor too egotistical to see others as our colleagues and equals.\n\nPurposeful activity and collaboration are the invigorating pleasures of work; but perhaps the main good and psychic benefit we derive from it \u2013 so obvious as to go too easily unnoticed \u2013 is a sense of usefulness. The need to feel useful runs deep in us, and is closely aligned with our need for a sense of purpose. We are social animals, and in order to feel that we matter, we need to be needed as well as esteemed or loved. To be affirmed as part of any group or community, we want to feel valued for our contribution to it. Of course, we baulk at being considered merely useful or instrumental, but work is an area of life in which we can temporarily subsume our particular personalities in the service of the impersonal needs of a group or a common aim \u2013 and (perhaps by a dynamic analogy with contemplative concentration) feel ourselves to be not diminished but enlarged thereby.",

      "content": "## 9.\u00a0\u00a0Relationships\n\n\u2018Work and love\u2019 was Freud\u2019s formulation for what was important in life, the central aspects of experience from which we derive meaning and pleasure. We don\u2019t much talk about love nowadays, but relationships continue to be of primary significance to all of us. At the same time, no area of experience has been affected more dramatically by digital technology than relationships in all their guises \u2013 from friendship to sociability to collegiality and, indeed, intimacy and love.\n\nOn the one hand, digital technologies widen the reach of our acquaintance and our access to others incrementally; most of us \u2018know\u2019 hundreds more people than we ever did before, and across a larger geographic territory. But what is meant by \u2018knowing\u2019 others has changed enormously. We \u2018talk\u2019 with each other voicelessly, via texting or Facebook; and we communicate with each other en masse, in Twitter-sized sound bites. Even sexual relations \u2013 formerly a privileged realm of deep privacy and complex passions \u2013 are increasingly conducted via dating apps such as Tinder, on the basis of snapshot information and with no necessary assumption of emotional involvement.\n\nPerhaps, occasionally, such virtually arranged encounters can result in a coup de foudre \u2013 an instant attraction that turns into intimacy and leads to a long-term relationship. But mostly they don\u2019t, and like other forms of hedonic behaviour, they all too often lead not to pleasure or mutual knowledge but to a stale sense of disappointment and deprivation.\n\nAuthentic human contact is the basic foodstuff of the psyche; in its absence, we become internally arid and diminished. There is a danger, however, that in our increasing reliance on digital communications we may be losing track of what such contact is, or how we can achieve it. In an important book, Reclaiming Conversation, Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist who has written intensively about the effects of digital technologies on our inner lives, worries that in losing our habit of face-to-face conversation we are also losing the all-important capacity for empathy \u2013 for understanding other people\u2019s minds and feelings. In studies of today\u2019s elementary school pupils, it appears that in marked contrast to previous generations, such children prefer their iPads and mobile phones to talking or playing with others; and that therefore their capacity for empathy, which usually develops quite naturally \u2013 the ability to recognize what other children feel, and act accordingly \u2013 is severely reduced. Digital children can be unwittingly mean to their schoolmates without realizing they are being hurtful, or reading the signs of other children\u2019s distress. Moreover, in our adult lives, we also increasingly prefer digital messaging to face-to-face contact. Our pleasure centres light up when our mobile phones signal a message, and we routinely allow virtual communications to interrupt our in vivo exchanges. The curtailment of basic human skills early on, and the loss of human contact in our adult lives, has worrying implications for all of our social and personal relationships \u2013 for the development of generosity and compassion, and for our ability to judge others\u2019 motives accurately.\n\nPlato Conversing with his Pupils \u2013 dialogue is foundational to philosophy, and to humane understanding.\n\nConversation \u2013 of the embodied, face-to-face kind \u2013 is of course the basic currency of human exchange, and is a way not only of knowing others, but of understanding ourselves. Indeed, we could hardly become ourselves, or know anything much, in isolation. Our identities initially develop through our early relationships with others, and our later understanding expands through various kinds of dialogue: with books, with teachers, peers and friends. Socrates conducted his philosophical teachings through dialogue; and dialogue is at the heart of depth-therapy and psychoanalysis (which in its first days was, after all, called \u2018the talking cure\u2019).\n\nIt\u2019s good to talk, and in some cultures and periods conversation was considered a high art, with settings dedicated to its cultivation. The French salon \u2013 that supposedly dandyish and frivolous institution \u2013 often had a serious purpose: to bring together like-minded people in order to discuss issues of the day outside the hierarchy and the ritualized forms of the royal court. In all registers \u2013 from sociability to collegiality, from teaching to political debate and informal discussion \u2013 conversation is a way of thinking with others; of testing our own and others\u2019 ideas, in a free and playful flow of shared thought.\n\nBut this happy combination of spontaneity and absorption requires, above all, unscripted time. In a piece called \u2018The Myth of Quality Time\u2019, Frank Bruni, a New York Times columnist, describes a family ritual in which twenty members of an extended family gather at a beach house for a \u2018solid week\u2019 \u2013 an amount of time which his friends find shockingly long, but which most people even a few decades ago would have found positively mingy. Bruni contrasts this form of being together with the notion of \u2018quality time\u2019, in which we dutifully set aside a pre-planned hour or two for what is, in effect, another task \u2013 girding yourself to pay close attention to another person. Bruni\u2019s unscripted week, in contrast, allows for the unexpected observation and the spontaneous encounter to emerge. \u2018With a more expansive stretch,\u2019 he writes,\n\nthere\u2019s a better chance that I\u2019ll be around for the precise, random moment when one of my nephews drops his guard and solicits my advice about something private\u00a0\u2026 Or when one of my siblings will flash back on an incident from our childhood that makes us laugh uncontrollably\u00a0\u2026 There\u2019s simply no real substitute for physical presence.\n\nThis should be obvious, but is becoming less so. In a way, we need to relearn what, for most people throughout much of history, came rather naturally: the habit of being with others, and learning about them through physical proximity as well as conversation and disclosure. Attraction can be instant, but forming a bond with another person \u2013 whether it is in friendship or intimacy \u2013 requires a particular kind of attentiveness, and the kind of time in which we can follow the train of another person\u2019s thought, or absorb their mood or expressive gaze without driving to a conclusion or thinking impatiently about our next appointment. The French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas thought that the source of all meaning and significance resided in the individual human face. In coming to know another person, we need to learn how to \u2018read\u2019 their expressive language as well as their verbal utterances.\n\nIndeed, the ability to be with others and to understand them is not very different from the ability to be with ourselves, and to know ourselves from within. We can only recognize emotions and responses in other people if we have experienced and understood them ourselves. In order to enter another person\u2019s inner landscape, we need to have travelled our own, and to have opened various areas of thought and feeling. If these are closed off within ourselves, then we do not have the instruments of perception with which to understand another person.\n\nThis does not mean that we need to abolish all distance, or separateness, between ourselves and others, or to merge with them to the detriment of losing our own agency or identity. In a way, the need for boundaries also mimics our relationship to ourselves, and the need for some detachment from our own impulses or emotions. The process of arriving at self-knowledge involves some separation from our unexamined impulses, or aspects of ourselves which we do not value. And, if our relationship to another person is to be one of equals, we also need the combination of empathy and boundaries. Empathy is not the same thing as automatic sympathy; if we find ourselves in conflict with a close friend or intimate, it is a better part of respect to say what we really think, rather than pretend anodyne agreement. If a partner engages in some small act of dishonesty or betrayal, a failure to express our disappointment or even anger may only suggest indifference or a lack of trust. For that matter, if a person we care about is struggling with some internal problem \u2013 say, they feel perennially underestimated by their colleagues \u2013 it is not sufficient to say \u2018There, there, of course you\u2019re right \u2013 you are great and they are fools.\u2019 That might be as unhelpful as it is unrealistic. Again, it is a better part of mutual respect to examine with the other person where the problem may actually lie \u2013 just as we might want to examine such a difficulty within ourselves. For this, we might want to delve more deeply into the causes of the problem with them, and find out together whether, for example, they are afraid to do their best for fear of failure; or whether they might be overestimating themselves, and therefore taking offence at others\u2019 appraisal of them.\n\nThat level of honesty calls for a great deal of trust. It requires us to apply the same standards of concern, love and realistic judgement to our friends and intimates as we apply to ourselves. Doing unto others as we would have them do unto us, if it is understood deeply enough, turns out to be a demanding motto and imperative. It requires not only a principled respect (necessary though that is to our social relations) but, at the intimate level, a recognition of another person as a full human being with emotions and a mind like our own.\n\nOf course, giving extended time to any one person is complicated by the same problems of proliferating choice that riddle our decisions in other areas of life. Dating sites increase the sense that there is countless plenitude of available partners. Why stop our search, or decide prematurely that one (always imperfect) potential partner will do? In a way, this is a version of a syndrome that has become prevalent enough to acquire an acronym: FOMO, or fear of missing out. Just what are we missing out on? What exciting things could we be doing, what fantastic people could we be meeting, at any one moment \u2013 or at least, on any one extended evening? FOMO used to be a phenomenon limited mostly to adolescents who dreaded not being invited to the right parties, but it now extends itself at least to young adults, and often further.\n\nIntimacy begins with entering the language of another person\u2019s face.\n\nThe seemingly endless availability of potential partners, combined with the almost complete lack of restrictions on sexual behaviour, mitigate against commitment; but as a gathering body of studies and personal testimony shows, this does not lead to greater satisfaction \u2013 any more than hedonic dispersion and impulsiveness lead to well-being in other areas of experience. In this all-important dimension of our lives, we also need to make our choices not in response to external stimuli, but from within. We may no longer believe in the romantic idea of \u2018one and only\u2019 object of love, but close relationships conducted with trust and candour remain the most fulfilling form of engagement and the most authentic source of meaning we know. Coming to truly know another person \u2013 whether it is a romantic partner or a friend \u2013 calls for all our powers of thought and the full palette of emotional perception. At the same time, such relationships allow us to express our individuality \u2013 our particular preferences, foibles and quirks \u2013 more completely than we can in any other area of experience; and therefore to be known and appreciated in three dimensions.\n\nIn contrast to virtual knowledge, which takes place in the flat spaces of computer screens and via abbreviated communications, intimacy proceeds from inter-subjectivity \u2013 an interplay of subjectivities which calls for authenticity of response, and a kind of reciprocal depth perception. In bringing all of ourselves into play, and in being perceived three-dimensionally, we come to experience our personalities and inner lives more vividly and richly \u2013 to exercise our full human intelligence. Our subjective selves need to be touched, as our bodies do. If we ever feel guilty or restless about giving open-ended time to an intimate or a friend, we need to remember that being with others \u2013 knowing others and being known in depth \u2013 is essential to our happiness, as well as to living a fully humane life.",

      "content": "## 10.\u00a0\u00a0Creative Play\n\nWork and relationships are the central pillars of our lives \u2013 at least, as most of us wish to live them; but there is another kind of activity which can engage us completely, and which both philosophers and psychoanalysts have considered just as essential to our development, and, indeed, to the development of culture. This is the often underestimated category of creative play. Although \u2018play\u2019 in all its forms can be highly pleasurable and involving, I would like to distinguish creative play from such activities as games or sports, in which the rules are prescribed in advance and the aim \u2013 winning \u2013 strictly and narrowly defined. By creative play, I mean something both more improvised and more \u2013 well, creative; that is, activities which leave room for imaginative exploration and discovery, as well as for unexpected results. Of course, play pervades many areas of life. Both work and relationships contain elements of happy playfulness, if we have achieved a certain level of ease and spontaneity within them; scientific discoveries are not infrequently made by dint of playful experimentation; and creative endeavour almost necessarily involves elements of playing around \u2013 with sounds, paint or words \u2013 as well as intense mental and imaginative effort.\n\nIn a wonderful book called Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, Johan Huizinga, a Dutch philosopher, suggests that both art and ritual, as well as (on the less happy end of the spectrum) war, emerge from a kind of playfulness: giving form which is both gratuitous and serious to important human activities, and to early intuitions about the human relationship to the universe or to each other. In Huizinga\u2019s analysis, our very ability to know emerges from a kind of conceptual playfulness. He particularly mentions certain archaic games \u2013 riddles, formal exchanges of questions and answers \u2013 which may be a very early form of gaining understanding through dialogue, of a back-and-forth between an acolyte and a spiritual authority. (Sometimes, such early games were played for pretty high stakes: if you couldn\u2019t answer the \u2018fatal riddle\u2019 of the Sphinx, death awaited!)\n\nIf play is at the root of culture, it is perhaps because the ability and the need to play seem to be built not only into our nature, but the nature of much animal life. Cats and dogs certainly play not only with each other, but with humans, as anyone who has had pets can testify. In children, the ability to play arises naturally if it is not hampered, and is necessary to full development. In the observations of the British psychoanalyst W. D. Winnicott, the child initially plays in the \u2018safe space\u2019 created by the proximity of a caring adult, by experimenting, say, with various arrangements of blocks. Such experimentation seems to be both an urge and a need of human consciousness; and in Winnicott\u2019s view, it is the origin of later cultural activity and the serious play of creative work.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be classified as \u2018creative workers\u2019, however, to feel the appetite for creative play or to benefit from its pleasures. There are cultures which have rich traditions of amateur creativity and experimentation, and British history is filled with examples. (Darwin, after all, was an amateur, and pursued his preoccupations without any assurance of results or rewards.) Before the beginning of the digital era, London (and undoubtedly other parts of the British Isles) was home to a wide variety of amateur activity in its still less hectic precincts: amateur chamber music groups and theatrical performances; people trying to breed new varieties of plants, or create devices for body-propelled flight. Possibly some very concrete results came out of such experiments, although for the people involved that was not the main point. \u2018Amateur\u2019 means literally \u2018lover of\u2019, and amateur endeavours are undertaken for the love of the thing itself. For the people engaged in them, such activities constitute a kind of \u2018free space\u2019 in which to give vent to their curiosities and abilities, without the constraints of competitiveness or worry.\n\nAt the same time, in order to be enjoyable, creative activities have to be undertaken seriously enough to be executed at a certain level of competence. Performing a Haydn quartet is no fun if it consists mostly of halting phrases and wrong notes; the point of staging an Oscar Wilde comedy, however informally, is lost if the actors muddle up their entrances and lines. Work contains elements of play, and in order to be pleasurable, creative play has to contain an element of strenuous effort \u2013 of concentration and discipline. It also needs to have form and structure. Both in childhood and later on, play is the non-instrumental use of the imagination, allowing it to wander where it will \u2013 but it turns out that the imagination, if it is allowed free rein, looks for and finds structure pretty fast. Children improvise rules for their interactive games \u2013 otherwise, they are not games, and no fun. Mature creativity also needs to find its forms in order to be satisfying. Playfulness gives expression to the sheer vitality of consciousness, and it depends on improvisation and cognitive flexibility, but it may also be a demonstration of our need to make sense of what we perceive and discover.\n\nThe urge to play is instinctive in children, and intrinsic to much cultural activity.\n\nIn the digital era, amateur activities have largely been replaced by virtual games, which are both a huge business and, for their devotees, a diverting and sometimes highly addictive pastime. It may be that such games increase alertness, as some of their advocates claim. But they do not call on our capacities for inventiveness or mental exploration. The invention, in these games, has already been done for you; the player\u2019s role is to respond, even if the range of response can be fairly wide. Crucially, digital games do not engage our bodies or physical skills. They involve the same limited actions as all our other transactions with digital technologies: the clicking of buttons, or moving a computer mouse on a desk surface.\n\nIn contrast to the constricted spaces of digital games, creative play is a way of exploring and expressing the full range of mental and imaginative possibilities freely, and most often through physical action. This can be as meaningful and absorbing as more functional or ostensibly serious projects. One famous example of someone who took creative exploration very seriously, even while being involved in the most serious possible endeavour, was Winston Churchill, who throughout much of his career remained a dedicated amateur painter \u2013 and for whom this \u2018pastime\u2019 played an important role in his emotional life. Churchill, who suffered from lifelong depression (which he called his \u2018black dog\u2019), said that painting \u2018came to his rescue\u2019 at a difficult time, and he devoted many hours to it throughout his career, even as he was commanding armies during World War II. This, for him, was hardly a frivolous hobby. Indeed, he compared thinking about painting to the process of making strategic decisions; and it may be that allowing our minds to move freely, whether in considering a scientific problem or the form of a painting, is the best way of arriving at complex conclusions and decisions. Churchill did not have professional ambitions as an artist, but he worked hard at it and gave it his entire concentration; and his reward was what we would now call the state of flow. \u2018I know of nothing which more entirely absorbs the mind,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018All one\u2019s mental light becomes concentrated on the task.\u2019\n\nPlay may seem like a cultural luxury, an extra; but cultures that lose their ability to play become repressive and static (think of the more severe forms of sharia law, with their restrictions on aesthetic pleasure). Indeed, in its various forms \u2013 from high to low, from frivolous to serious \u2013 play may be both at the root of culture, and one of its high achievements: an expression of basic human freedom, and of the need for freedom in order to be fully ourselves.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many ways to live; but to live meaninglessly is to miss your life. If we rush through our days and months in ceaseless activity, and without taking stock of what we\u2019re doing, we can soon lose track of what we are doing it for, or why it matters to us. If we are not to move through our activities mindlessly, or to denude our experiences of significance and depth, we need to orient ourselves in our lives \u2013 and within ourselves: to muse, relish, reflect and occasionally even to be bored.\n\nIn order to live lives worth living \u2013 so the old philosophers taught us \u2013 we need to know who we are, and to be guided by deliberately chosen aims and purposes; and for that, we need, in our busy lives, to give time to the cultivation of knowledge, and the practices of self-knowledge. We live in demanding, individualistic, diverse societies \u2013 and beyond that, in a complex, interconnected, often turbulent world. The conflicts, catastrophes, triumphs and ordinary human struggles in all parts of the globe enter our lives via vivid images on television screens or on those smaller ones. Such awareness implicates us; and it is part of being a sentient and responsible person to think about the larger world we live in, and respond to it in ways which reflect our values and our understanding. But if we are to give value to our own lives, we also need to nurture our perceptions and internal resources, to cultivate our capacity for play and pleasure, and to draw on our knowledge and self-knowledge in order to use ourselves wisely and well. A sense of meaning which allows us to be fully alive comes from our involvement with others and engagement in the world; and it comes, above all, from within.\n\nHomework",

      "content": "## I. The Problem\n\nDigital addiction is an omnipresent contemporary problem, and the literature about its effects on our selves and brains is large and growing. I have found several books about it informative and useful:\n\nThe Shallows: How the Internet Is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember by Nicholas Carr is an impassioned disquisition on the profound (and in his view mostly negative) impact of the internet on our minds and brains \u2013 our capacity to think, read and store experiences in long-term memory. Carr is a writer about technology, and this is no Luddite tract; but his arguments are personally felt and comprehensive.\n\nMind Change: How Digital Technologies are Leaving Their Mark on Our Brains by the neuroscientist Susan Greenfield also tackles the effects of pervasive technological change on our brains, identities and relationships. It\u2019s very accessible, and leavened with some personal examples and anecdotes.\n\nRichard Restak\u2019s The New Brain: How the Modern Age is Rewiring Your Mind is another neurologist\u2019s take on digital overuse and the speeding up of our lives, and is particularly good on the effects of multitasking and the impact of digital technologies on young brains \u2013 and therefore, on the next generation\u2019s. It is accessible and clear.\n\nRenata Salecl\u2019s The Tyranny of Choice is a short, reader-friendly book on the anxieties induced by the illusion of free choice, and by the idea that we can change our identities and lives for the better by following a few tips on how to do so. The ideology of choice, Salecl argues, is at the centre of the consumerist society, and it breeds the idea that we can shop for ourselves as well \u2013 and diverts us from struggling with more serious social issues. Salecl\u2019s argument is somewhat ideologically loaded, but worth listening to.\n\nWhy Love Hurts by Eva Illouz is an original and incisive study of how the wide-ranging availability of potential partners, and of sexual choice, has lessened the incentive to commitment among men. Illouz is particularly good on the historical shifts in relations between men and women, and the changes wrought by the sexual revolution.",

      "content": "## II. Leisure\n\nLeisure: The Basis of Culture by Josef Pieper is an eccentric but fascinating book written by a religiously inclined philosopher, wherein he argues that leisure is the foundation of Western culture, and of its philosophic tradition \u2013 and that modernity has supplanted this ideal with the tyranny not so much of work itself, as the ideology of work. Even thinking, Pieper argues, has become reformulated as \u2018intellectual work\u2019, rather than being understood as the capacity for contemplation and wonder \u2013 for the authentic \u2018philosophic act\u2019. \u2018Leisure\u2019 is so outside the mainstream of our current thinking as to be thought-provoking.\n\n\u2018In Praise of Idleness\u2019 by Bertrand Russell is a diverting, rather dandyish essay, arguing that we have overdone the ethos of work, and that we would be much better off working only four hours a day.\n\nFor the processes of introspection, there is a large body of psychoanalytic classics, to stimulate thinking about the patterns of internal life. Freud is a wonderful writer, and his case studies read like intriguing detective fictions, pursuing clues contained in symptoms and dreams, to get at deeper psychic truths.\n\nA Life of One\u2019s Own by Marion Milner (aka Joanna Field) is a beguiling account of one person\u2019s attempt to understand herself, and to disentangle her own desires, preferences and sources of pleasure from the cultural pressures and imperatives which have formed her. In An Experiment in Leisure, she continues to examine herself with the aid of images which have been important to her \u2013 from mythology, religion, art and her own memory. A wonderful companion to one\u2019s own experiments in self-knowledge.\n\nAdam Phillips\u2019s many books and essays are stylish, often whimsical, and informed by literature and philosophy as much as by psychoanalysis. Darwin\u2019s Worms is an extended meditation on the need to accept mortality as part of our human condition, and in order to value more intensely the time we actually have in our lives. Going Sane is valuable for affirming the temperate state of sanity and the pleasures of normalcy, against assumptions about the \u2018creative\u2019 value of neurosis and extreme mental states.\n\nFor a more scientific approach to the mind\u2019s ways, Antonio Damasio\u2019s Self Comes to Mind is a fluently written and rigorously argued investigation of the complex interactions between feelings and meanings, emotions and the brain, in the construction of consciousness and sense of self. Damasio is a neuroscientist who is interested in the human psyche, and his account of how our perceptions and selves are constructed makes for stimulating reading.\n\nGerald Edelman\u2019s Wider Than the Sky is a meticulous analysis of the neurological processes which go into the basic act of being conscious \u2013 with some mysteries still unsolved.\n\nIn a fictional vein, Virginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse captures lyrically and precisely the movements of her characters\u2019 minds, in states of reverie, free-association, and moments of contemplative epiphany.\n\nProust\u2019s Remembrance of Things Past is of course one of the greatest and most beautiful literary meditations on the strata of memory, and the presence of the past within us. Its several volumes can be savoured over several holidays, or as a reading pleasure for a year.\n\nThere are countless books on the pleasures and merits of reading, music and art. This is a very arbitrary selection of texts which bring to these age-old themes some contemporary concerns.\n\nAlberto Manguel\u2019s A History of Reading is a compendious and enjoyably digressive history of this activity, showing how the manners and morals of reading have changed over the centuries (it took a while for people to learn how to read silently!), and why the act of reading is so important to the development of literature, the life of cultures and the cultured life.\n\nStop What You\u2019re Doing and Read This! is a collection of ten essays by contemporary writers on the importance of reading actual books. Passionate, personal and varied in their approach, the essays remind us why reading matters, why it is so enriching, and why it is an essential form of connection to others, and to the world.\n\nThe Aesthetic Brain: How We Evolved to Desire Beauty and Enjoy Art by Anjan Chatterjee is a neuroscientist\u2019s up-to-date take on the aesthetic impulse. Chatterjee clearly appreciates and enjoys art, and his theory of \u2018neuroaesthetics\u2019 combines the idea of integrated perception with the proposition that our responses to art are ravelled with other forms of pleasure \u2013 in food, sex, and even money.\n\nMusicophilia by Oliver Sacks is an examination of musical cognition, why and how music is so deeply embedded in the brain and memory, and why it has such powerful effects on us, for good and sometimes ill. Sacks was a neurologist with a flair for the quirky case study, and here, he gives some diverting examples of both the disturbances of the musical sense, and instances of surprising musical ability. He is particularly moving on the power of music to heal, and to sustain a sense of self in the face of its loss.\n\nThe Singing Neanderthals by Steven Mithen is a fascinating book, drawing together evidence from archaeology to child psychology, and the study of birdsong and primate communication systems, to posit the hypothesis that music precedes spoken language and leads to its development.\n\nOn the process of making choices and decisions, I particularly like Avner Offer\u2019s The Challenge of Affluence \u2013 a thought-provoking sociological study of how an excess of choices in various areas of life affects our ability to make decisions, control our impulses, or commit ourselves to long-term goals. Rife with statistics and case studies, this is nevertheless a readable book about the challenges to well-being paradoxically posed by affluence \u2013 and it is suggestive about the need for some self-control and long-term thinking.",

Engagement\n\nOn the pleasures of engagement, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s books on \u2018flow\u2019 (Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play; Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience; and others) offer perhaps the most promising propositions on how to achieve states of full involvement and absorbed satisfaction in work and play.\n\nIn Together: The Pleasures, Rituals and Politics of Cooperation, Richard Sennett, a philosophically informed sociologist, talks about the urgent need, in our diverse societies, to learn the practices of cooperation and solidarity, on every level from work to civil society \u2013 and to be engaged with others in collaborative rather than competitive ways.\n\nIn Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age, Sherry Turkle reminds us that conversation is crucial to all forms of relationship and knowledge, and that in shifting to digital communications in lieu of living contact, we are in danger of degrading our capacities for empathy, learning through dialogue and for forms of public debate. We need to reclaim the space for conversation in order to nurture forms of contact basic to our common culture and our humanity.\n\nFor a historical attempt to capture good talk before the digital age, read The Age of Conversation by Benedetta Craveri \u2013 an un-nostalgic history of the French salon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the rise of conversation as a highly valued skill. Full of diverting facts about who was there, and who said what to whom, The Age of Conversation is also a serious look at the salon as an important political institution and space for unofficial discussion.\n\nFor the value of play, Homo Ludens by Johan Huizinga is the classic, but probably still unsurpassed text. Huizinga, a Dutch historian who was one of the founders of cultural history, looks at the origins of culture in the \u2018play element\u2019 of ritual, spectacle, riddles and games. An original and fascinating book, giving us glimpses of sensibilities very different from our own; and at the same time, reminding us that play is a basic feature of many human activities, and the basis of the creative imagination.\n\nChildren\u2019s Games in Street and Playground by Iona and Peter Opie is a study, based on extended observation, of games \u2013 sometimes very rough \u2013 generated and invented by children themselves. The Opies were students of children\u2019s \u2018folklore\u2019, and offer wonderful evidence of children\u2019s need for play, and their spontaneous creativity, when they are left to their own devices.

All other ages before our own held that our lives were at least half in the hands of gods or spirits, who could be influenced through prayer and sacrifice and who required complex forms of worship and obedience. But we have increasingly put our energies into understanding natural events through reason: there are no more omens or revelations, curses or prophecies; our futures will be worked out in laboratories, not temples. Even the nominally religious will demur to highly trained physicists and cancer specialists. God has died and modernity has killed Him.",

To be modern is to believe that we can continually surpass what has come before: national wealth, knowledge, technology, political arrangements and, most broadly, our capacity for fulfilment, seem capable of constant increase.

In the former, when people lived in small communities, when the course of one\u2019s career was understood to lie in the hands of the gods, and when there were few expectations of individual fulfilment, at moments of failure, the agony knew bounds; reversal did not seem like a verdict on one\u2019s whole value as a human being. One never expected perfection, and did not respond with self-laceration when mishaps occurred. One simply fell to one\u2019s knees and implored the heavens. But Durkheim knew that modern societies exacted a far crueller toll on those who judged themselves to have failed. No longer could these unfortunates blame bad luck; no longer could they hope for redemption in a next world. It seemed as if there was only one person responsible and only one fitting response. As Durkheim showed, in perhaps the largest single indictment of modernity, suicide rates of advanced societies are up to ten times as high as those in traditional ones. Moderns aren\u2019t only more in love with success, they are far more likely to kill themselves when they fail.",

      "tags": "consumerism, shopping, identity, prosperity, happiness",
      "content": "## 1 Consumer Capitalism\n\nThe most significant aspect of modernity that separates it from every era previously known is a relatively humdrum and apparently inconsequential activity: shopping. For most of the history of humanity, shopping was straightforward: there was nothing to buy. Ninety-eight per cent of the income of a Northern European peasant in the twelfth century went on food: porridge, bread, cabbage, peas and, in a good week, mutton (in China, it was rice, millet, turnip, yams and, at favourable points, a duck). There was next to nothing left to spare thereafter; inventories of the dead in fifteenth-century England show that a person might pass away owning nothing at all besides the clothes they had collapsed in and a stool or a knife. It would have been a sign of true prosperity to lay claim to a candlestick.\n\nThen, in the middle of the seventeenth century, in the countries of the North Atlantic seaboard, an astonishing phenomenon started to unfold: thanks to incremental improvements in farming techniques, ordinary people began to have just a little more money at the end of the month than they needed in order not to starve. The sums were modest and the items for purchase equally so: a belt, some brass buttons, a chest, a copper pan, a night hat. But demand led to increased manufacturing, which then \u2014 in a virtuous cycle \u2014 fed back into employment. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, average wages in Northern Europe were on a gentle upward curve. Products that only a few generations back would have been inconceivable were slowly becoming more affordable. Cottages acquired hardwood floors, women might buy a second dress and men a waistcoat for Sundays, a child might have a doll, a family a padded chair.\n\nNorthern Europe was witnessing the world\u2019s first consumer revolution, in which goods that had once been luxuries were becoming affordable to an expanding public. An emerging middle class began to buy embroidered linens, cutlery and crockery, sideboards, dining chairs, divans, coffee, cookbooks and pictures. Fashion magazines allowed people in provincial towns to see \u2014 with only a few weeks\u2019 delay \u2014 what the most elegant women in London were wearing in the evening. In the two centuries that followed, the consumer revolution spread to every region of the world, becoming ever more significant. In 1893, the newly launched Sears catalogue gave ordinary Americans access to a previously inconceivable array of goods. With an improved postal service and a nationwide chain of warehouses, one could order \u2014 and within only a few days receive \u2014 anything from hair curlers to lawnmowers, toilets to firearms \u2014 as well as more esoteric items like a pump to develop one\u2019s breasts and a cream to enhance one\u2019s chest.\n\nAdvertising in the Sears catalogue, 1897.\n\nIn the cities, enormous sums were invested in the construction of department stores, baroque palaces of consumption that presided over new shopping boulevards. In 1882, Hermann Tietz opened Berlin\u2019s first emporium, whose sumptuousness was designed to loosen shoppers\u2019 hold on reality and induce them into a trance-like state in which they might more readily return home with a giraffe-skin sofa from the third floor or an Amazonian parrot and cage from the menagerie in the basement. A globe above the door was decorated with carved ostrich feathers, pearls and brocades; there was a vaulted ceiling, skylights, protruding angels and a dramatic open atrium lined with gargantuan plate-glass windows through which Berliners might peer and dream, as if at an aquarium.\n\nTietz Department Store, Berlin, 1910.\n\nIn Paris, the Galeries Lafayette opened its first palace in 1912. It had a tearoom, a smoking room, an oriental bath and a forty-three-metre-high stained-glass dome.\n\nIt seemed almost normal when the department store announced a 25,000-franc prize to the first pilot who could successfully land on a twenty-metre-long runway specially constructed on its roof. This manoeuvre was accomplished in January 1919 by a veteran of the First World War, Jules V\u00e9drines, to the wonder of a global newspaper audience and a 10,000-strong crowd in the streets below.\n\nLanding by Jules V\u00e9drines, Galeries Lafayette, Paris, 1919.\n\nA paradoxical element of the consumer revolution was how serious apparently \u2018small\u2019 things became in its wake. The most minor items \u2014 shirt collars, shampoo, scrubbing brushes, margarine \u2014 contributed to fortunes unprecedented in size and scope. Sums of money that could once have been sequestered only through the conquest of nations or the edicts of kings could now be peacefully accumulated through the skilful merchandising of chocolate bars and hair creams. As a consequence, new types of people began entering the upper ranks of society. Someone who might have made his money offering the public chocolate ices or fairground rides could be richer than Amenhotep III of Egypt or live more grandly than the Inca emperor Atahualpa. One of the most powerful men of late-nineteenth-century England, William Lever, built his fortune selling soap \u2014 bars of Lux and tubs of Sunlight.\n\nWilliam Strang, William Hesketh Lever (1851\u20131925), 1st Viscount Leverhulme, 1918.\n\nThe newly wealthy might not obey the standard etiquette expected of elites, however. They might use the wrong fork, blow their noses too loudly, and, in speeches at white-tie dinners, refer in an unvarnished way to what they had learnt from Ma back at the homestead \u2014 to the sniggers of old landed money.\n\nBut economists understood that ices and soaps were no laughing matter. If a country wished to be prosperous, it needed to engage in the buying and selling of modest consumer items on a mass scale. High-minded ideals were very well, but it was malls and home-shopping catalogues that underpinned a nation\u2019s wealth and strength. A moral case for mass consumption began to be made. The sale of coloured hair clips and lemon soda might not be elevated in itself, defenders proposed, but this was what provided the tax receipts to pay for the maintenance and welfare of the poorest in society, for the schools and orphanages, for the universities and the technical colleges. How heavily a nation was involved in the trade of so-called \u2018silly\u2019 things determined how much it would have to spend on hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nIt might once have seemed impressive to intone biblically against the absurdities of commerce, but it was more short-sighted and cruel to leave a nation without the money to shelter its weakest members. Churches could wax lyrical about charity; only businesses could generate the money to pay for it.\n\nThe growth in consumer society was accompanied by an enormous expansion in education. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Northern European countries were schooling their populations up until the age of fourteen. Alongside reading and writing, they offered maths and geography, science and literature. A powerful nation needed an educated citizenry. And yet there was one subject in which no instruction was ever offered or even thought necessary: the business of shopping. The assumption was that all the difficulties would lie in trying to accumulate money; spending it would be the easy part.\n\nOscar Bjorck, Madam Henriksen\u2019s School for Girls in Skagen, 1884.\n\nBut the matter may not have been so simple. It has been a bedrock of philosophy ever since Socrates that human beings are exceptionally bad at distinguishing correctly between what they need and what they desire, between what they require to flourish and what merely seems enticing yet might in fact injure or impair them. So long as, for most people, there was simply nothing available to be desired other than an extra serving of cabbage or a slice of cocker spaniel, the decision was chiefly theoretical. Yet in the new conditions of modernity, when the entire purpose of the economy came to be that of raising disposable incomes in order to facilitate non-essential consumption, the matter of how to spend fruitfully and accurately moved from being an issue of academic obscurity to an existential priority.\n\nWe too often frame the chief problem of consumption in terms of price (a failure to pick a bargain), but the errors can be more fundamental. Spending successfully depends on grasping the intimate links between what we acquire and how we feel. When we choose an unhelpful item (it might be an eclair or a house, a pair of shoes or an education), it is because we lack sufficient knowledge of our own natures. We make for imperfect consumers for the same reasons that we slip up in multiple areas of our lives: because we are untrained amateurs in the art of making ourselves happy; because we lack self-knowledge.\n\nNone of this would necessarily matter if the stakes weren\u2019t so high. The tragedy of consumerism is that we have, over a couple of centuries, rearranged the world in the name of a privilege we may be unsuited to. We have diverted rivers, felled ancient woodlands, chained workforces to cubicles, darkened the skies and encouraged ourselves to spend the majority of our waking hours away from our loved ones in pursuit of ever greater incomes, all in the hope that we might, over time, come to smile more regularly.\n\nYet so often, on the way back from the department store or the kitchen design shop, the estate agency or the water park, we privately acknowledge that we have once again not been able to lay our hands on the nerve centres of our own pleasure and might, all things considered, perhaps be in a mood to start crying.\n\nIt is one thing to be miserable; it is more poignant to be so when our sole underlying ambition was to achieve contentment. This is the irony we pick up on in images of modern funfairs and holiday resorts, whose existence is premised on their ability to deliver satisfactions that may elude us. Our failures to have fun are a greater indictment of modern consumer culture than the miseries of work. The sweatshops, the rubbish dumps, the waste waters, the exhausted commuters \u2014 all these are to be lamented, but the real targets of puzzlement and rage lie elsewhere: in the fractious atmosphere inside luxury sedans, in the heartbreaks inside gated compounds, in the dissatisfactions of the family of the coal-mining tycoon, in the sicknesses of the soul at the fun palace.\n\nRob Ball, Funland, Weston-Super-Mare, 2015.\n\nAs consumerism gained momentum in the eighteenth century, there was a degree of recognition that money couldn\u2019t just be spent, but had to be spent wisely.\n\nHowever, the focus of concern tended to be narrow, centring on two activities in particular: drinking and gambling. Reformers pointed out how quickly lives might be ruined in gin alleys, and how much one might lose sight of one\u2019s true allegiances in gambling dens. To combat these allurements, moralistic posters and prints spelt out the consequences of addiction. One might beat up one\u2019s loved ones after a few bottles, or, as in Robert Martineau\u2019s The Last Day in the Old Home (1862), need to sell all one\u2019s belongings after a compulsive run at poker.\n\nGeorge Cruikshank, sixth illustration from the series The Bottle, 1847.\n\nRobert Martineau, The Last Day in the Old Home, 1862.\n\nThe problem with such moralism is not so much its high-handedness as its scope. It isn\u2019t only drinking and gambling that might need to carry warnings; unfortunate consumption has a far greater sway upon us than this. To the extent that we are drawn into any kind of expenditure that prevents us from flourishing and that cuts us off from sources of true nourishment, we are the victims of commercial seduction. It isn\u2019t surprising that we should often be so; huge interests are at work, seeking to persuade us of the wisdom of following certain prestigious ideas: of believing that happy people drink champagne; that a partner is not serious unless they buy their beloved a diamond ring; that we cannot be good parents until we have taken our children skiing\u2026. It can take uncommon strength to stand up to a trend.\n\nWe get a hint of the bravery required when we see artists making a protest against prevailing notions of beauty and good taste and lodging talented objections in the name of their own divergent visions. In mid-eighteenth-century France, the dominant artistic trend was the Rococo style, which emphasised idealised romantic scenes, aristocratic grace, luxurious prettiness, ribbons, gauze and lots of pastel-coloured flowers. It would have taken a great deal of self-awareness and inner confidence to say that, on reflection, this was not one\u2019s own idea of fun and that beauty and interest might lie in a very different place.\n\nJean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, The Prayer Before a Meal, 1744.\n\nThe French painter Chardin had the imperative to record a different register of enthusiasms. At considerable cost to his reputation, he explained over a succession of canvases that happiness as he understood the term lay elsewhere: in quiet and rather serious domestic scenes, in kitchens and parlours; in preparing tea for the children or in reading a book before bedtime; in a simple vase on a sideboard or in a loaf of bread broken open on a table.\n\nJean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, The Happy Lovers, c. 1760\u20131765.\n\nWe can seldom match such bravery. The fear of being thought strange prevents most of us from taking our less socially endorsed tastes seriously. We go with Rococo in one era, flared shirts in another. We might not want to follow the script on how to dress ourselves, go on holiday, evaluate a book, celebrate a child\u2019s birthday, honour a loved one, run a marriage, prepare a dinner party or lead a life, but we meekly go along with expectations for fear of standing out. Far from being dogmatic, self-centred creatures, we are often touchingly tentative about our own intuitions; we lead most of our lives firmly within a web of assumptions created for us by others.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that our tastes are entirely simple and that all consumption is, for that reason, idle; more that our tastes are varied and anomalous. It might be well after middle age that we finally abandon the dominant story of what we\u2019re meant to wear, eat, admire or ignore and arrange our affairs as we had long secretly hoped. Part of the problem is that we lack the ability to know, looking back over our experiences, what in fact brought us pleasure. Our brains aren\u2019t keen on taking apart their own satisfactions and therefore plotting how to recreate them more reliably. We may know that we like a given film or friend, but it can be hard to say why. We\u2019re not natural critical dissectors of our experiences; therefore it can feel strange and difficult to comb through the details of a holiday or a party, the purchase of a jacket or a bicycle in a rigorous search for the pleasing or painful elements that would ideally guide our expenditure henceforth.\n\nModern governments are often interested in consumer demand. They carefully track how much of it exists, panic at any decline and may move to stimulate it when it fails, aware that fluctuations in the total sums that people spend have enormous consequences for employment patterns and tax revenues. And yet the high-level emphasis on demand falls squarely on its quantity, not on its quality. From a government point of view, it doesn\u2019t matter whether people are buying poetry classes or handguns, salads or iced doughnuts, psychotherapy sessions or sports cars. All that counts is that the total spend should be elevated.\n\nYet, in a deeper sense, it does matter what we spend our money on, because the combined consumer choices of billions shape the kinds of societies we live in and the sorts of lives most of us will be able to lead. Contrary to what economists tell us, there are better and worse kinds of demand. Demand for guns may really be less \u2018good\u2019 than demand for education. Demand for health-giving food truly might be \u2018better\u2019 than that for corn-syrup rich desserts.\n\nConsumer society has not been short of critics who have suggested that we should try to unwind advanced capitalism in order to return to the simpler lives of our ancestors \u2014 and in the process rediscover a happiness that we lost in the global shopping mall. But the issue is not whether to consume or not (we have plenty of genuine needs to satisfy); it is how we might consume well \u2014 that is, in line with our best understanding of the preconditions for individual and collective flourishing.\n\nWe are at the dawn of the consumer age. In the context of the history of Homo sapiens, only in the last few seconds have we even had the possibility of buying anything beyond subsistence. It should not surprise us if we regularly stumble into error, purchasing an unwanted bread-making machine or a dispiriting holiday, an ill-fitting hat or an unsuitable navigator timepiece. We might also fail to give sufficient weight to some of our latent consumer wishes \u2014 to invest in a trip to Samarkand or line our room with soundproof panels, eat clementine and mint compotes or give away our money to an interesting stranger. We\u2019re still learning how to discover and stay true to our own identities amid skilfully engineered pressures to conform. We know all about the aspiration to make money \u2014 and we devote most of our lives to dutifully doing so. The task ahead is to grow correspondingly ambitious around the largely unmentioned business of shopping \u2014 the not-so-modest matter upon which the whole of modern socio-economic reality is founded.",

      "content": "### Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs\n\nAt one level, this was inconvenient, not least because Maslow had proposed that once humans had fulfilled their basic needs, they would quickly move on to thinking only about their higher needs: once they had a car and some summer and winter clothes, they would naturally aspire to what Maslow cryptically but tantalisingly called \u2018self-actualisation\u2019. This appeared to presage economic disaster for advertisers and their clients. If someone already had a slightly battered but roadworthy 1948 Tucker Torpedo in the garage, their need for transportation would be satisfied; there would be no way to interest them in a 1953 Studebaker Commander Starliner or an Oldsmobile \u2018Rocket\u2019 V8. And if someone already had a few quite serviceable clothes, they would have no interest in a new grey flannel suit from Eagle or a couple of summer jackets from Springweave. By so efficiently catering to humanity\u2019s basic needs, America\u2019s mass production industries were in danger of engineering their own demise.\n\nOldsmobile car advertisement, 1951.\n\nFortunately for them, there was an important suggestion of salvation lurking in Maslow\u2019s work. Maslow had implied that when humans are distracted or insufficiently guided, when their spiritual ambitions have been thwarted or left fallow, they may neglect their higher needs and develop disproportionate appetites for lower ones instead. This provided a promising opening to advertisers. It now seemed that the way to get customers shopping was not to emphasise the capacity of a product to fulfil a basic need, as advertisers had always naively assumed. The basic need was likely to have been addressed a long time ago; the customer probably already had a car, they almost certainly had enough clothes to keep out the elements. Instead the move was to try to elicit an ambition to buy a product catering to a basic need by alluding to a higher one. It was to imply an offer of a solution to a vital spiritual hunger while in fact \u2014 at the last moment \u2014 swerving to direct the customer to a shirt or a car, a washing machine or a breakfast cereal. So long as the possibility of fulfilling a higher need was conveyed with sufficient artistry, customers might not notice the sleight of hand.\n\nHepworths clothing advertisement, 1957.\n\nA so-called \u2018good\u2019 advert now became a very specific proposition; a piece of communication that could delicately connect, in the viewer\u2019s mind, a \u2018basic\u2019 object to a vaguely relevant but inaccessible \u2018higher\u2019 need. A car might be twinned with a search for love, through imagery of an embracing couple, perhaps setting off to orgasm on a phallic rocket; a suit advert might be twinned to a search for career fulfilment through the use of actors who appeared self-possessed and authoritative. One would unconsciously think one was acquiring love and meaning while practically investing in a motor car or a cotton suit. It sounded simple, but the move has been the central ingredient powering consumer capitalism ever since.\n\nNearly every advert now is selling us one material thing while, beneath the surface, hinting at the appeasement of another higher need. It may look as though one is buying a bag or a pair of shoes, a stay in a hotel or a kind of drink, but really what is tickling us unconsciously is a secret promise of the spiritual goods we ache for: a need for love and meaning, connection and calm, understanding and freedom.\n\nModern advertisers have a good sense of what we want: it\u2019s just that \u2014 without admitting it \u2014 they refuse to sell it to us. What seems to be on offer isn\u2019t for sale. This is simply because capitalism has not yet managed to produce companies that are interested in addressing the \u2018higher\u2019 category of Maslow\u2019s account of our needs. This isn\u2019t to say that such companies will never or could never exist. There is nothing inherently impossible about a company dedicated to providing people with sincere friends or the skills they would need to build a connection with them. It is entirely plausible to imagine a vast corporation devoted to helping people to have more successful relationships or to discover more meaningful ways of leading their lives. It is just that capitalism currently lags behind our best understanding of our own needs; the products and services we tend to buy and sell one another fulfil only one part, and arguably not the most important part, of the spectrum of our needs. We are still waiting for entrepreneurs who will move the aspirations of capitalism towards the higher spectrum, who will build corporations to tackle our spiritual appetites and thereby honour the aspirations of capitalism to make us profoundly rather than only partially satisfied, and to do so not through the deceitful merchandising of superfluous things, but through the genuine satisfaction of the complete range of our needs.\n\nIn the meantime, we may grow weary of the energies of the selling industry. The central districts of all the world\u2019s largest cities are covered in outsized illuminated displays, many of them ten storeys high, drawing the attention of consumers to items of questionable relevance to the facts of the human condition. At Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, a million people a day glance up at gigantic renderings of hair products and ice lollies, lipsticks and whisky bottles. The night sky is lit up with incantations to deodorant and clothes softener.\n\nShibuya Crossing, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nIt is tempting to conclude that societies have developed a preposterous obsession with selling. In fact, we have always been interested in selling; it is simply what we are selling that has changed.\n\nIn the second part of the twelfth century, the largest effort at outdoor illuminated advertising ever undertaken took shape across Northern Europe. In Canterbury and Worcester, Wells and Salisbury, Chartres and Rheims, Metz and Cologne, master builders started work on cathedrals that had vast stained-glass windows, many times brighter and taller than the signs in Piccadilly Circus or Times Square. Rather than trying to interest us in hamburgers and lip balm, these illuminated windows, filled with glittering squares of reds and greens and dazzling petal-shaped arrangements of lilacs and buttercup yellows, had different messages to impart. To audiences below, these illuminated billboards spoke of love and charity, redemption and melancholy. When fully lit up by the rising and setting sun, they spoke in resplendent brightness of kindness and a concern for those weaker or more troubled than us. They wished us to be modest and thoughtful, open-hearted and tender.\n\nThe North rose window, Chartres Cathedral, France.\n\nWe may have no time for the specifics of the religion that sponsored these cathedrals, but the ambition is worth noting. The cathedrals were in the business of selling, yet had their sights on advertising the most complex and noble aspects of our nature. The medieval Christian Church was a multinational business, no less so than a modern corporation, yet it was focused on fulfilling, in Maslow\u2019s sense, our higher needs. It combined financial acumen, managerial discipline and psychological intent, which, for all the Church\u2019s many faults, remains a provocation to our own times.\n\nWe could start to imagine a more dignified version of advertising for the future; one that was less interested in badgering or shouting, in nagging or jollying and, most importantly, that no longer needed to excite our attention by seeming to offer us one thing while in fact selling us another. This kind of advertising would have a different sort of client base, some of whom might still make shirts and haircare products, but others of whom might be pioneering solutions to our higher needs as well. In the shopping districts of the future, there might be gigantic illuminated billboards promoting effective aids for loneliness, cures for broken hearts and strategies for calm. We remain at the dawn of capitalism \u2014 and therefore of knowing how honourably to buy and sell one another the many things that we truly need to flourish.",

      "content": "## 3 Materialism\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the problem with modern societies is that they are far too \u2018materialistic\u2019, which is taken to mean that we are far too interested in buying objects. This is not entirely fair. We are indeed materialistic, but not primarily because we buy a lot; rather because we harbour an immense faith in the power of whatever we do buy to affect our state of mind. We aren\u2019t so much greedy as hopeful. We may, for example, develop a faith that a certain kind of diamond ring will render us able to sustain a long-lasting and harmonious relationship, or that a soft drink will be able to assist us in healing the divisions in our family.\n\nCoca-Cola advertisement, It\u2019s a Family Affair, c. 1950.\n\nOur belief that complicated psychological ambitions might be accomplished through the possession of an object is a poignant feature of our age. We hope these objects will have success in transforming complex and elusive bits of our internal functioning: a soap might bring an end to anxiety; a bag could assist one in recovering hope; a watch could unblock a relationship with a wary child.\n\nAlmost all religions have made use of material objects. They\u2019ve invested in particular sorts of furniture, clothes, buildings, statues and images, and seen these as adjuncts to their spiritual mission. This has not been without controversy within the religions themselves. Reliance on material forms has intermittently come under fire from a minority of believers who have argued that spiritual transformations should only ever require spiritual means, material objects being redundant in the project of healing the soul.\n\nSuch religious hostility to materialism reached its European high point in the early Reformation, when outbreaks of systematic looting and destruction known as iconoclasm broke out across parts of England, the Low Countries and Germany. The spiritual opponents of materialism burnt elegant priestly robes, smashed paintings, chopped pulpits into firewood and snapped the heads off statues to make the point that anyone with a spiritual goal in mind should avoid harbouring interest in material forms.\n\nUtrecht Cathedral, Holland, sixteenth century.\n\nHowever, the mainstreams of most religions have never been so definitive. Interestingly for the modern age (which wrestles with its own iconoclasts around consumerism), they have allowed a place for materialism. They have, with useful caveats, hinted that there might be such a thing as \u2018good materialism\u2019. Good materialism is the fruit of a search for a genuine and balanced place for material objects within the overall context of a good life. It means neither assuming, like certain iconoclasts will, that all material things must be superfluous and that an interest in them is therefore derisory and suspect. Nor does it mean imagining that material things must have a quasi-magical power to ease complicated psychological dilemmas. Good materialism suggests that material things can contribute to, but never replace, the arduous psychological work required to achieve fulfilment, connection, purpose and peace of mind.\n\nIn so far as material objects can be helpful, it is when they embody in visible form attitudes and dispositions that are often forgotten in the noise of daily life. The attitudes, often with spiritual associations, in turn benefit from being made prominent through matter. For example, for a Christian, the decoration of an Alpine wooden chapel \u2014 with its crooked pews and walls and a naive rendition of the Virgin above the altar \u2014 might make ideas of humility or patient effort feel more recognisable and real than they would have done if they had simply been explained in a book. The peace one was looking for within would have robust encouragement from outward forms.\n\nSimilarly, a Zen Buddhist bowl might pull its viewer back to key tenets of Zen\u2019s belief system through its shape and design: its modesty, its gracious acceptance of imperfection, its dignified simplicity. Certain spiritual ideas might be easier for a believer to remember and put into practice when a material equivalent is available to be absorbed by their eyes. In such cases, material objects might assume the status of goads or encouragers. Their design points to an inner destination \u2014 albeit one to which they can\u2019t take us all on their own.\n\nZen Buddhist bowl, eighteenth century.\n\nThis philosophy of material objects can also be applied to the consumer realm. A secular object may \u2014 just like a religious one \u2014 embody an important set of values; it might be hope or courage, straightforwardness or sweetness. By having the object around us, the values it refers to, and that might otherwise have been intermittent in our thoughts, have a chance to grow more stable, resilient and convincing; the material object becomes a prompt for inner evolution. An inherited watch could act as a talismanic reminder of a beloved relative\u2019s approach to life; a certain kind of chair, handmade with care and attention to its materials, might encourage an attitude of acceptance. Alternately, objects can be a spur to change by how they make one behave: a pair of sunglasses might help a shy person to discover reserves of confidence; a brightly coloured new top might have a role in cementing a break with a sorrowful past.\n\nTherefore, it isn\u2019t that material objects have no role in fulfilment; it\u2019s that the main effort we need to make will, unfortunately, always involve an engagement with our psyches and those of others. Calm won\u2019t come simply from flying to a particular destination and having an outdoor bath; it will be the result of studying the faint sources of our long-buried anxieties over many patient months. Likewise, friendship won\u2019t magically emerge from a certain sort of soft drink; it requires that we make ourselves available to someone, that we dare to be vulnerable around them and know how to interpret what they tell us with imagination. And a good family can\u2019t spring ready-made from the acquisition of a new timepiece; it will involve being patient around the many trials of adolescence and the courage to lay down boundaries that might involve short-term tensions and recriminations.\n\nModernity has made us feel less prepared for a lot of this. It has encouraged us to have excessive faith in quasi-magical solutions originating out of material things. It has encouraged us to believe that objects can have a greater effect than they ever can. In certain quarters, this has bred a furious iconoclasm that has rendered us guilty for our supposed greed. It can matter immensely to our state of mind that the colours and forms in our vicinity are a certain way, that there is a particular atmosphere and spirit to the things that we see and touch every day. However, beauty can only ever be the handmaiden of wisdom; it cannot be its sole catalyst. We should be careful neither to decry nor excessively to celebrate material life. We should ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by manufacturing, are those that stand the best chance of encouraging our higher, better natures.",

      "content": "## 4 Media\n\nAround the mid-nineteenth century, artists in a rapidly modernising world began to take note of an increasingly popular activity that attracted their aesthetic attention, as much because of its novelty as because of its inherent significance. This activity was elbowing aside older routines and embedding itself into the structure of the everyday. It was shaping the intimate inner world, becoming something one would resort to whenever there was a quiet moment. It was a newly sacrosanct and solemn process that had, as the German philosopher Hegel remarked, replaced morning prayer in the lives of all modern citizens: reading the newspaper.\n\nThe nineteenth century witnessed an explosion in newspaper publication and readership. A lot of this was down to technological innovation. Paper that had always been laboriously made from old textiles (hemp, linen and cotton) was, from the late 1840s, produced at a fraction of the cost from fibres extracted from wood pulp. The 1850s saw the development of high-speed steam-driven rotary printing presses, followed by stereotype plates from the 1870s, and linotype in 1884. In the thirty years after 1850, the cost of producing a single sheet of newsprint in Europe and America fell by ninety per cent. At the same time, more and more people could read. In Britain in 1800, around fifty per cent of the population had been illiterate; by 1870, it was twenty-two per cent, and by 1900, three per cent \u2014 figures that were almost identically repeated in France, the United States and Germany. Furthermore, the rapid spread of railways after 1850 meant that modernising countries could now carry newspapers from their capitals and large cities to their provinces in a matter of hours.\n\nIn terms of what might be printed, the options were vastly increased by the invention of the electric telegraph in 1837 and the completion of the first transatlantic cable in 1858, which reduced communication times between Europe and North America from ten days (by ship) to just minutes. To further equip journalists, the telephone was invented in 1876 and the world\u2019s first commercially successful typewriter, the Remington no.2, in 1878.\n\nOn the back of such developments emerged the world\u2019s first truly mass-market newspapers. By 1870 in New York, The Sun, The New York Herald and The New York Daily News were each reaching 100,000 readers a day. In Germany, the Berliner Morgenpost was selling 400,000 copies daily from 1898 onwards. Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph had a circulation of 350,000 by 1876. And in France in 1890, Le Petit Journal became the world\u2019s first newspaper to sell a million copies; within another five years, it was selling two million.\n\nWilliam Merritt Chase, The Morning News, c. 1886.\n\nIn order to achieve such circulations, newspapers had made one significant breakthrough in their understanding of psychology: that no human can resist tales of another\u2019s catastrophes. Fortunately for them, the nineteenth century was an exceptionally calamitous era. The new technologies being introduced were at once hugely powerful and (blessedly) unreliable. On an almost daily basis, as urgent undersea telegraph cables revealed, somewhere in the world, an ammunition dump would blow up, a bridge would collapse or a tall building would founder. Trains were the true godsend to newspaper editors. On 6th January 1853, as newspapers down the eastern seaboard of America explained, a train carrying the President-elect Franklin Pierce, his wife Jane and their son Benjamin toppled off an embankment near Andover, Massachusetts \u2014 instantly killing the son (\u2018innocent Ben\u2019, as the newspapers baptised him). Only a few months later, in Connecticut, a train ran over an open drawbridge and fell into the Norwalk River, killing forty-six and severely injuring thirty.\n\nIn the so-called Great Train Wreck of 1856, two North Pennsylvania Railroad passenger trains collided head-on at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Fifty-nine people were killed and two hundred more were badly burnt. The conductor of one of the trains committed suicide the same day. The newspapers were transfixed.\n\nA further capacity to stun readers over breakfast was achieved through the invention of photography. The earliest photo of a train wreck recorded a head-on collision in August 1853 in Valley Falls, Rhode Island; thirteen people were killed and fifty badly injured.\n\nEarliest known photograph depicting a train wreck. Providence and Worcester Railroad near Pawtucket, Rhode Island, August 1863.\n\nTo technological disasters was added a stream of gripping murders. Sunderland-born Mary Ann Cotton poisoned twenty-one people with an arsenic-filled teapot and was hanged in Manchester in 1873. Kate Webster killed and dismembered her employer, Julia Martha, in Richmond, London, in 1879. A nurse, Amelia Dyer, Victorian England\u2019s most prolific child murderer, was hanged in Newgate Prison in 1896 for killing 400 babies.\n\nEven better for the papers, some crimes refused to be easily or quickly solved. A thirteen-year-old, Susie Martin, was abducted in New York in 1894: the headless, armless torso of what one paper called \u2018the once fair body\u2019 was found three weeks later, but it took five years for an itinerant ex-slave to be blamed for the murder. In the meantime, there were many questions for the newspapers to speculate on: \u2018Where are the head, legs and arms?\u2019 implored The New York Post.\n\nThe New York Post, 1894.\n\nOf course, terrible things had always occurred in history, but never before were so many people exposed regularly to the very worst cases, carefully collated from around the world. To read a daily newspaper was willingly to submit to being dipped in a river of horror. By throwing the emphasis on the most outlandish possibilities, newspapers taught their readers to consider the planet as a dystopian morass, a place where strangers perpetually abducted and dismembered schoolgirls, where babies were at all times being kidnapped in the night, where trains were always falling into swollen icy rivers, where every carer was a paedophile and every government official a crook \u2014 a place where it was evidently absurd to trust or hope, to rest or be inspired.\n\nWhile setting itself up as an instrument of enlightenment through which to look more clearly at events, the newspaper ended up obscuring what life is \u2014 for the most part \u2014 actually like. It helped us to forget that almost everyone is kind, that nearly every train reaches its destination, that some impressive and good things happen in government, and that most days are quiet and uneventful. Far from \u2018informing\u2019 us, despite the transoceanic cables, press conferences and foreign bureaux, newspapers helped us to lose touch with the true nature of peoples, technologies and governments \u2014 leaving us in our own way less informed than an illiterate medieval farmer who, despite his lack of access to daily bulletins, at least knew how to form a picture of reality from the evidence of his own senses.\n\nAn associated risk opened up by newspapers was that one might, under their tutelage, forget how to feel. It might have appeared as though newspapers were helping us to feel rather a lot: outrage, horror, sorrow, pity, empathy. And newspapers certainly claimed, when explaining their higher purpose, that they were engaged in banishing ignorance and prejudice and helping nations to understand one another better. However, despite all the information they contained, these papers had a marked weakness when it came to getting us properly to engage with most of the facts they laid before us. Given the agonies we were reading about, what was striking was how little any of it really touched us. A newspaper might, for example, inform us that 50,000 people had died in an earthquake, that an orphanage had burnt to the ground killing 200, that the harvest had failed on another continent, that a ship had run aground off Greenland and that someone had killed their extended family with an axe, and our response might simply be to sigh for a moment, then to look up and turn the page. An eerie gap opened up between the dramatic events that were being narrated and the inertia and nonchalance one typically registered on reading two dozen of them over breakfast.\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne, The Artist\u2019s Father, Reading \u2018L\u2019\u00c9v\u00e9nement\u2019, 1866.\n\nWe are creatures designed for intimate contact, for local lives and personal relationships. For ideas to become powerful in our souls, they need to be anchored in experience and in substantial stories.\n\nThis is what art has always known, which is why, in the hands of a talented storyteller, the account of the loss of a child\u2019s favourite toy can elicit pained emotion far exceeding what we experience when the morning paper informs us of the deaths of 10,000 combatants in a brutal civil war on the other side of the planet.\n\nThe newspapers of modernity overlooked the fact that they weren\u2019t merely in the business of gathering facts; they also had to help their readers to care about them. They forgot to consider the role of art. They overlooked the idea that their chief enemy was not ignorance, but indifference \u2014 to which the solution was all the techniques found in the treasury of the literary and visual arts. In 1816, French newspapers reported that a naval frigate, the M\u00e9duse, had run aground off the coast of Africa, with the loss of 133 lives. Only a few survivors made it, clinging desperately to a raft for many days.\n\nTh\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, The Raft of the Medusa, c. 1818\u20131819.\n\nIn the pages of a newspaper it was just one forgettable item in the vast catalogue of maritime disasters reported on every day. But the great French painter G\u00e9ricault made it live in the imagination of humanity forever. He spent months on the position of every figure on the doomed raft, working on facial expressions, paying attention to the waves and the sky, editing and compressing, and seeking the universal in the particular.\n\nIn April 1937, like G\u00e9ricault many decades before him, Pablo Picasso came across a shocking story in a newspaper. Like G\u00e9ricault, when he came to address the massacre of innocents in the town of Guernica, he allowed us to feel revulsion and rage at the insanity of war that we would never have felt if we had just picked up the account of the aerial bombing of a Basque town by the German Luftwaffe\u2019s Condor Legion in a column in the International Herald Tribune.\n\nPablo Picasso, Mother with Dead Child II. Postscript of Guernica, 1937.\n\nArt may not only get us to feel; it can draw our attention to how much we have forgotten to do so. Unlike G\u00e9ricault or Picasso, Andy Warhol took aim at the deadening force of the media itself. When an Air France Boeing 707 crashed on take-off at Orly Airport on 3 June 1962, killing all but three on board, Warhol wanted to admit \u2014 as the newspapers themselves never would \u2014 how little of this apparently significant incident would ever really matter, either to readers or news organisations; how soon it would become just another part of the banal spectacle of horror with which modern papers have surrounded us since the early nineteenth century. We might wonder for a moment, take an interest in a severed hand or leg or two, and then move on to the business of the day.\n\nIn his decision to transform that disastrous morning\u2019s front page into a sober abstracted silk screen, Warhol made our unnoticed callousness his subject. When asked what made him produce the picture, Warhol explained: \u2018I made it because every time you turn on the radio, they say, \u201cfour million dead\u201d. But then when you see the gruesome pictures over and over again, they don\u2019t have any effect.\u2019\n\nIt would be his goal to make the sort of picture that could shake us from our customary apathy, that would not allow us immediately to forget this charred plane as we had so many others before it. It is a tribute to his genius that Air France Flight 007, long after it had been forgotten by the news organisations that first brought it to prominence, will, like G\u00e9ricault\u2019s raft and Picasso\u2019s screaming mother, live on forever in the annals of art.\n\nAndy Warhol, 129 Die in Jet, 1962.\n\nCenturies before there were newspapers in the modern sense, what we would call news was comprised of information sent, usually at huge cost, between royal courts and the distant parts of their kingdoms. Letters would arrive informing the king that there was a shortage of grain in the east, rumours of invasion from the south, an unexplained rise in the price of copper from a neighbouring country or some unrest in a village near the mountains \u2014 information that was both useful and targeted, and on which he would be called to act.\n\nAs newspapers developed, they took on much of this role, continuing to convey information that would be of great importance to anyone trying to run a government, though, in a democratic spirit, this was now sent out to everyone: a sheep farmer in the village of Castlebay in the Outer Hebrides; a wine importer in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, or a retired soldier in Pincher Creek, Alberta. A lot of this information, when it reached one\u2019s doorstep in the morning, was liable to feel urgent and alarming: someone in parliament was stealing money from a discretionary fund; there was an oil leak in a nature reserve; a fungus was destroying the harvest; the deficit was spiralling because of mismanagement in the audit office.... It was only normal to feel exercised; the impulse was to pick up the phone, ask some tough questions and hunt for solutions.\n\nBut then would come a humbling realisation: despite the papers one had been given to read, one was in fact only working at the post office or teaching maths to a class of under-eights, managing a bowling alley or looking after an elderly relative. Contrary to what one had imagined, there was no one to call. One wasn\u2019t expected to come up with any ideas; there was no urgent meeting to discuss matters with the foreign minister. This was the paradoxical state of mind produced by newspapers in modern democratic states: one is at once extremely well-informed, deeply exercised \u2014 and completely powerless.\n\nMary Cassatt, Reading \u2018Le Figaro\u2019, 1878.\n\nOne response might be rage. We might bang our fists at the image of the politician who hasn\u2019t followed our advice around welfare reform for disabled veterans or the secretary of state who hasn\u2019t listened to our plans for the prison system. We might write angry letters to the newspapers outlining schemes for the management of the economy or the education of sixteen-year-old apprentices. As our loved ones attempt to prepare dinner, we might tell them precisely what should be happening with supply chains in the department of agriculture.\n\nWhat the newspapers don\u2019t tell us is that the wisest step might also be the most unlikely and taboo-sounding in modern society: not to listen, or rather to listen a little less. Not to pay attention to every outrage and inefficiency, not to keep delivering speeches to the unresponsive photographs of treasury officials, not to keep thinking of what should happen next with the electrification of the railway line\u2026. These and a thousand other issues like them might be important, but, despite the suggestions, not in fact important to us.\n\nSomeone will need to sort out the mess in government, to ask themselves big questions around the economy and to fix the delays to the road-building programme, but this is not our job right now. Fate has imposed a different set of burdens upon us. Our responsibilities lie elsewhere, in less heralded and prominent places: with a child struggling to cope behind an outwardly gruff manner; with a group of colleagues confused as to their roles; with our own minds that, restless and unfathomed, need to be investigated, interpreted and calmed. The most urgent priority might be not to know, in order that other, more important, elements closer to home might gain the prominence they deserve.\n\nThen again, our obsession with news is no coincidence. It can be tempting to throw ourselves into its arms, because it\u2019s so hard to lead our own lives. The dilemmas in our relationships, the questions around our careers, the unresolved regrets and hurts in our pasts \u2014 all these can be so painful and so daunting to consider that it becomes a compulsive pleasure to obliterate ourselves in the news of a furious hurricane ripping through the faraway tropics or a harrowing tale of a murder in a foreign town. News becomes the instrument through which we will forget about a life that feels too difficult to progress.\n\nThe newspaper is only too keen to welcome us in our confusion. It invites us to share in the troubles and joys of its revolving cast of characters and incidents. It encourages us to grow knowledgeable about certain issues (why a law had to be passed, how the police bungled the event, why the bond market reacted as it did). It is very cruel. It pretends that this is our business, that this is what needs to count for us now, but soon enough, the issues will ebb away while the sand on the hourglass of our own existence will have continued to run down silently and remorselessly.\n\nThe trouble caused by newspapers comes down to their authority; their ability to squat at the centre of societies and persuade us that they possess the power to decide what matters and who we are, thanks to their technology and their manpower, their mastheads and their intrepid reporters. They tell us what kinds of countries we are living in and what properly counts. They are the arbiters of importance, the sifters of events, and the righteous judges of humanity\u2019s experiences. By keeping up with them, we gain an answer to the question we long to have answered: what is really going on?\n\nThe story they weave will only ever be one story, and a very partial one at that, about what is actually unfolding. There is so much that they will not notice: the kestrels in the night sky; the undramatic labour of millions; the random acts of kindness; the minor technological breakthroughs; the disasters that didn\u2019t occur because someone remembered to put the brakes on or check the pistons; the things that have always been there, like the oak tree and the light of dawn, the inevitability of death and the comfort of an embrace.\n\nThe newspapers hammer national consciousness into their image. We awake every morning, our minds filled with echoes of dreams, half-remembered projects, scattered excitements, fragile impulses \u2014 and must then collide against a brutal, unyielding wall of news that seems to say that none of that mattered, nothing of what you are trying to become or have been can in any way count, for we must listen instead to what the president said and what the stock market indicates. And because we are all still somewhere little children who once sat in school assembly and listened to supposedly important teachers telling us what is what, we sit in deference before the newspaper\u2019s national morning \u2018assembly\u2019.\n\nIt was the dubious achievement of the newspapers of the nineteenth century to standardise the mind. They did to the varied fruits of our imaginations and intelligences a little of what industrialists like Henry Ford achieved in manufacturing: they helped to mass-produce thoughts; reducing their variety, increasing their spread and stripping them of their local particularities.\n\nThe French novelist Gustave Flaubert had a special hatred of newspapers. The most repulsive character in Madame Bovary (1856) is the pharmacist Homais, who is described as spending all his evenings piously reading the paper and then peppering his conversation with reflections and portentous facts turned out in newspaper offices in Paris and Rouen. In an essay on Flaubert\u2019s novel, Milan Kundera remarked that idiocy has always existed, but that for a long time humans had been able to comfort themselves with the hope that it would eventually be banished by knowledge. Yet the rise of newspapers has forced a terrifying realisation: far from knowledge banishing idiocy, it can lend it fuel and false confidence. The newspaper has given birth to one of the most unexpected personalities of the modern age: the well-informed idiot.\n\nThe artists of the Dada movement of the early twentieth century considered newspapers to have pretty much started the First World War: they had spread stupidity and bile, they had coarsened minds and made people readier to accept the futile reasoning of the generals. This was why so many of Dada\u2019s creative figures cut up newspapers and glued them into irrational collages, disassembled their seeming logic and made them articulate the preposterous nonsense they had quietly been uttering all along.\n\nJohn Heartfield, Whoever reads bourgeois newspapers becomes blind and deaf: away with the stultifying bandages!, 1930.\n\nThe founding premise of the news industry is that the new and the important are one: what is important is new and what is new is important. But for most of us, for the length of our lives, this is likely to be untrue. What has just happened will not be the most important thing we need to know. What may really matter for our flourishing might have happened twenty or a thousand years ago; it may have been recorded in a book that has been sitting on a library shelf since the 1500s.\n\nIn 1854, two years before Flaubert published Madame Bovary, across the Atlantic, the essayist Henry David Thoreau, a no less hostile critic of newspapers than Flaubert, took aim at our wholly unjustified excitement about the latest information: \u2018We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.... We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide [granddaughter of George III] has the whooping cough\u2026\u2019\n\nWe may not need \u2018novel\u2019 information at all. What we may most urgently require is encouragement to make more of the things that we\u2019ve theoretically known for a long time already but have seldom listened to. The news we really need is that which speaks of the imperative to forgive, to reflect, to appreciate, to be grateful, to be still and to be kind; these are the true bits of news we should push everything else \u2014 the fires, the murders, the crashes and the crises \u2014 aside for in order to render them more solid in our minds. Sometimes, and indeed usually, the news might just be the least important and least urgent thing we need to know.\n\nAmbrosius Benson, The Magdalen Reading, c. 1520.",

The superiority of the modern state is thought to be nowhere more in evidence than in its way of electing its leaders. For the longest part of history, we did not choose any ruler fairly, outside of a brief moment in ancient Greece. Rulers were absolute: their word could not be contradicted, their powers checked or their terms curtailed. They claimed that God Himself had appointed them, so that to question their word would be to commit both treason and blasphemy. There was to be no limitation on a ruler from the people: only God could decide if a ruler had been unjust. An angel was said constantly to hover over the head of Louis XIV of France; Charles II of England proposed that his ascension had been a result of a mandate from heaven; when still only a child, Louis XV was assumed to have received authority to awe his nation from divine sources.\n\nThen, during the second half of the eighteenth century, humanity\u2019s tolerance for undocked obedience began to crumble. It no longer seemed so clear why monarchical opinions could never be contradicted or why an aristocracy, let alone ordinary people, might not have a measure of influence over their own lives. The age of democracy began. Corsica became a republic in 1755, Haiti in 1791. In Britain, the First (1832) and Second (1867) Reform Acts gave the vote to a majority of the working classes. Universal male suffrage was introduced in France, the Netherlands and Denmark following the revolutions of 1848. In 1893, New Zealand became the first country to give all women the vote.\n\nThere was particular poignancy when, in 1844, King Otto of Greece set up a parliament in Athens and gave his country its first taste of participatory government since Philip II of Macedonia had ended ancient Athens\u2019s experiment with democracy (demos, citizenry; kratos, rule) 2,000 years before. When President Obama visited Athens in 2016, he praised his hosts by saying that Greece, together with the United States, were the two nations that had taught the world how to love freedom.\n\nDespite our enthusiasm for \u2018freedom\u2019, the spread of democracy has not, in modern times, always enjoyed unquestioning or uncritical support. Grumbles have long accompanied humanity\u2019s march towards democratic forms of government.\n\nN. Orlof, A Session of the Parliament, c. 1880s.\n\nAt the outset, as democratic ideas first acquired popularity, many of those who had most benefited from the old order became intransigent. In the more feudally-minded enclaves of Bavaria and Wiltshire, Normandy and the Veneto, reactionaries fought against the expansion of the franchise. It was absurd for peasants or women to be offered a chance to vote when they had forever been passive and easily subjugated. In England, the old Tory gentry were especially resistant; already in the eighteenth century, as modest moves to rectify the voting system began, they tried to undermine reform, bribing electorates, fiddling results and threatening candidates.\n\nIn the satirical images of William Hogarth, we see their venality and self-interest on grotesque display. In one depiction of a corrupt campaign in Oxfordshire in 1754, we are shown two hustings, blue for the Tories, orange for the (mildly more left-leaning) Whigs. A lunatic asylum has been opened and the comatose and befuddled inmates (who can\u2019t even write their own names) are being eagerly bribed to vote Tory. For their part, the Whigs are trading votes for cash \u2014 and cheating the electoral roll. To one side, a lady representing Britannia is crying out from inside a broken-down coach, as her two indifferent drivers gamble at cards (one is swindling the other). The moral is clear: the powers that be want elections and democracy to fail for the lowest of reasons.\n\nWilliam Hogarth, The Polling, c. 1754\u20131755.\n\nYet there were more high-minded motives at play among other opponents of democracy. As democratic reforms increased in pace, in many countries, members of the old aristocracy rediscovered a love of the Middle Ages, and pointed to the sometimes selfless and gallant devotion showed by knights towards kings and queens. The new medievally-minded monarchists spoke of the spirit of sacrifice and love that their ancestors had once shown their rulers. These ancestors hadn\u2019t wanted to be \u2018free\u2019, they had wanted to serve \u2014 surely a far greater and more admirable calling, ran the argument. To express their commitment to the idea, many aristocrats commissioned portraits of their families in medieval dress. Shops selling copies of old armour opened up in London.\n\nDaniel Maclise, Sir Francis Sykes and his Family, c. 1837.\n\nIn Scotland in 1839, the Conservative politician Archibald William Montgomerie, the 13th Earl of Eglinton, lamenting that aristocratic pageantry was disappearing from national life because of an emerging cost-saving spirit, organised a medieval \u2018joust\u2019 on his estate, Eglinton Castle. Preparations for the joust had begun a year before the event when 150 knights gathered in an antique armour and sword shop in Bond Street. After practising over many months in a pub garden in north London, the knights made it to the Earl\u2019s estate, where, in front of an audience of 100,000 (and a specially constructed tent filled with \u2018ladies\u2019 in embroidered dresses), they recreated scenes of horsemanship, gallantry and courage.\n\nJames Henry Nixon, The Melee from the series The Eglinton Tournament, 1839.\n\nThe Earl\u2019s granddaughter later recalled that most of her family\u2019s wealth had been squandered on the event \u2014 but that the Earl had never considered his joust a failure on those grounds alone, as many of the new practical money men of the era would surely have done.\n\nOther objections to democracy were less sentimental. One rigorous tradition criticised the democratic folly of allowing a mass of largely uneducated, penniless, aggrieved and inexperienced people \u2014 many of them inflamed by newspapers \u2014 to vote on matters of technical complexity and strategic importance. Democracy was willingly allowing fishmongers to decide how to run economic policy and hairdressers to have a say in the management of the navy.\n\nThese arguments were not new. As classical scholars appreciated, one of ancient Greece\u2019s greatest achievements, philosophy, had been highly suspicious of its other achievement, democracy. In the dialogues of Plato, the founding father of Greek philosophy, Socrates, had been pessimistic about the ambitions of democracy. In Book Six of The Republic, Plato described Socrates falling into conversation with a man called Adeimantus and trying to persuade him of the flaws of democracy by comparing society to a ship. If you were heading out on a journey by sea, asked Socrates, who would you ideally want to decide who was in charge of the vessel? Just anyone or those educated in the rules and demands of seafaring? The latter of course, replied Adeimantus. So why then, responded Socrates, do we keep thinking that any old person should be fit to judge who should be the ruler of a country?\n\nFor Socrates, voting in an election was a skill, not a random intuition. And, like any skill, it needed to be systematically taught. Letting the citizenry vote without thorough training was as irresponsible as putting them in charge of a trireme sailing to Samos in a storm. Socrates was not elitist in the old Tory sense. He didn\u2019t believe that only a narrow few should ever vote because a deity or tradition had decreed as much. He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply deserved to influence affairs; he was fighting for an epistocracy, the rule of the educated few. Otherwise, he feared the rise of a system that the Greeks had had fateful experience of before: demagoguery (demos, citizenry; agogos, leading). Athens had allowed the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking young man, to seize power, corrupt institutions and push the city state into disastrous military adventures in Sicily.\n\nSocrates appreciated how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one of whom was like a doctor and the other like a sweet shop owner. The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: \u2018Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He\u2019ll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will.\u2019 Socrates asked us to consider the audience\u2019s response: \u2018Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer \u2014 \u201cI cause you trouble, and go against your desires in order to help you\u201d \u2014 would cause an uproar among the voters, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\n\nMany shared the doubts \u2014 and knew their Plato. They understood the risk of electing far too many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors. Prominent among these epistocrats was H.G. Wells, Europe\u2019s bestselling author in the English language in the early part of the twentieth century. In his The New World Order (1940), Wells imagined a future where government would at last be free either of the influence of uneducated simpletons or of aggressive gangsters. It would be placed instead in the hands of a cadre of thoughtful, scientifically trained experts, masters in their respective fields, who would guide humanity to its true potential. Wells pictured broadcasting, education, economics, medicine and urban planning being left to a cognitive elite. Whatever the short-term clamour from the street, these experts in government \u2014 positioned in a hall perhaps a bit like a modern space centre, filled with the latest statistics and reports \u2014 would understand that their duty was to create a state that could approximate the finest moments of Athens, Florence, Amsterdam and Jerusalem.\n\nWells would have admired the artworks of the French eighteenth-century architect \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, who pictured his city of the future as similarly monumental, clean, rational and ordered. \u2018Science has toiled too long forging weapons for fools to use,\u2019 Wells wrote. \u2018It is time she held her own hand.\u2019\n\nAn epistocratic future: illustration by \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, 1784.\n\nBut beneath some of the objections to the way democratic government was arranged, something else was stirring. The problem was not only that there were now a lot of people voting, but that there were now a lot of people. A basic fact about the modern age is that it was a period of vastly expanding populations.\n\nIn 1800, the population of Western Europe stood at 180 million; by 1914, it was 460 million. It is easy to underestimate what lay behind such numbers; it meant that, for the first time, pretty much everywhere one went, there would be crowds. The demos was not only loud, it was growing very, very numerous. There were crowds on bridges and crowds in railway stations, crowds in museums and crowds in shopping arcades, crowds at Lake Windermere and crowds at the Pyramids, crowds at the cliffs of Schaffhausen and crowds at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome. The increasing interest in remote adventures \u2014 the conquest of the Poles, the crossing of central Africa, the opening up of the Andes \u2014 wasn\u2019t a coincidence; it was symptomatic of an age being driven to distraction by a new inability to be alone.\n\nWilliam Powell Frith, The Railway Station, c. 1862.\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t just numbers of people that was the problem; it was the perceived quality of the people. No doubt, when just a few aristocrats had made it to a certain church or waterfall, there had been a good few fools among them, chortling, braying, ruddy-faced, unimpressive sorts who had perhaps been known as Bunter or Sticky at Eton or Harrow. But simply on the basis of overall numbers, they had not had a power to shatter the atmosphere. Now, the issues could no longer be disguised. In the corridors of the convent of San Marco in Florence, during a performance of Cimarosa\u2019s opera Il matrimonio segreto in Milan, at a mass in the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden, or at the foot of the Bernese Oberland on the train between Zurich and Geneva, one could be certain of running into a particularly prominent kind of imbecility \u2014 at odds with the music, the heroic snow-capped peaks, the priestly voices, the tender renditions of the Virgin Mary and the opera\u2019s heroine singing plaintively: \u2018Fidatevi, Che segreta son io\u2019 (Trust me, what a secret I am). There was always someone blowing their nose and someone asking the way to the bathroom.\n\nGustave Flaubert had tried to get away from it by sailing to Egypt in 1851, but democratic idiocy followed him everywhere, as he reported in an irate letter home: \u2018Stupidity is something immovable; you can\u2019t try to attack it without being broken by it\u2026. In Alexandria, a certain Thompson from Sunderland has inscribed his name in letters six feet high on Pompey\u2019s Pillar. You can read it a quarter of a mile away. You can\u2019t see the Pillar without seeing the name of Thompson, and consequently, without thinking of Thompson. This cretin has become part of the monument and perpetuates himself along with it. What am I saying? He overwhelms it by the splendour of his gigantic lettering\u2026. All imbeciles are more or less Thompsons from Sunderland. How many one comes across in life in the most beautiful places and in front of the finest views? When travelling, one meets many\u2026 but as they go by quickly, one can laugh. It\u2019s not like in ordinary life where they end up making you fierce.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thompson from Sunderland\u2019, Pompey\u2019s Pillar, Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nWhen Thomas Hardy went to the British Museum in 1891, he was appalled by how unattuned the many visitors were to the spiritually elevated relics laid out before them: there were \u2018crowds parading and gaily traipsing round the mummies... the girls casting sly glances at young men across the swathed dust of Mycerinus. They pass with flippant comments the illuminated manuscripts \u2014 the labour of years \u2014 and stand under Ramses the Great, joking. Democratic government may be justice to man... but it will lead to more of this contempt, and possibly be the utter ruin of art and literature.\u2019\n\nIn an attempt to render art and literature safe again, many artists decided to make their works deliberately hard to understand, so that there would be no more jokes and no more flippant comments, no crowds and no flirtatious lovers. What we know as the Modernist movement was partly a calculated attempt to move away from intelligibility and charm towards mystery and elusiveness (\u2018I don\u2019t see how any civilised person can watch TV, far less own a set,\u2019 confessed the Modernist poet W.H. Auden). There was no danger of a mob showing up to interrupt Salvador Dali\u2019s Un Chien Andalou and no excited audience screaming for an encore after a performance of Arnold Schoenberg\u2019s experimental song cycle Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten. Obscurity would be to the arts what de-inventing the railway car or closing down the offices of Thomas Cook would have been to mass tourism. Through abstruseness, modern artists made sure that Thompson from Sunderland wouldn\u2019t interrupt the proceedings.\n\nA still from Salvador Dali\u2019s Un Chien Andalou, 1929.\n\nThe background problem was that \u2018ordinary people\u2019 were not quite as the early educated defenders of democracy had hoped. They were not particularly grateful; they weren\u2019t especially spiritual, and they could be very direct in their behaviour. To cite a word often used by sceptics of democracy from the 1820s onwards, they were frequently deemed to be \u2018philistines\u2019. In his 1869 book Culture and Anarchy, the poet and critic Matthew Arnold wrote that: \u2018Philistines are devoted to money-making and a narrow form of religion; they are indifferent or hostile to beauty; they are \u201cthe enemy of the children of light\u201d.\u2019\n\nA focus on making money might seem a logical enough concern for those who had had little option but to dwell in poverty since the beginning of time, yet for many sceptics of democratic life, it was evidence of the overbearing and apparently unnatural cupidity of the modern age. In protest against these \u2018new philistines\u2019, sceptics therefore emphasised other values, the very anathema of commercialism: impracticality, a loathing of money, disinterest in being on time, eccentricity, and a love of \u2018useless\u2019 art. The poet and dandy G\u00e9rard de Nerval, in a turn against the hurried pragmatic commercial spirit of his time, acquired a pet lobster in 1840, which he tied with a leash made of blue silk and took for walks in the gardens of the Palais-Royal in Paris. \u2018Why should a lobster be any more ridiculous than a dog?\u2019 he asked, \u2018or a cat, or a gazelle, or a lion, or any other animal that one chooses to take for a walk? I have a liking for lobsters. They are peaceful, serious creatures. They know the secrets of the sea, they don\u2019t bark, and they don\u2019t gnaw upon one\u2019s monadic privacy like dogs do.\u2019\n\nIf there was one detail that especially enraged mass society\u2019s sceptics, it was the tendency of ordinary people to consume large quantities of canned food, mushrooms, peaches, pink salmon and Spam especially. For the sceptics, nothing better summed up the Philistines\u2019 alleged concern for ease and practicality over quality and authenticity than their enthusiasm for cans. Figures as diverse as D.H. Lawrence, H.G. Wells and Graham Greene denounced cans bitterly. \u2018We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun,\u2019 concluded George Orwell.\n\nA Spam advertisement in a US magazine, 1940s.\n\nObjections to the democratic age ranged from the profound to the silly. But if one were to single out one resonant and meaningful complaint, it was that democracy had begun as a way to elect leaders by the vote of a majority, and yet \u2014 at its worst \u2014 it had now spread far beyond its original remit. It had become a way of deciding the worth and significance of anything by the verdict of a majority: what a good book might be, how to go on holiday, how to judge one\u2019s career or arrange one\u2019s love life. The most pernicious aspect of life in a democratic society was a constant quiet pressure to conform, to fall in line with a majority-based view of what might be \u2018normal\u2019 and congruent with what everyone else happened to think.\n\nFor the French aristocrat, politician and writer Alexis de Tocqueville, travelling around the United States in 1831, the distinguishing mark of democracies was not so much their way of choosing leaders as their way of thinking. There was such a thing as a \u2018democratic mind\u2019, and it was not, for de Tocqueville, an especially flexible or admirable organ. Such a mind hated to be different, it had tendencies to squash new and unfamiliar ideas and it cleaved closely to whatever happened to be fashionable. It was therefore seldom very interesting \u2014 and it could often be unkind. De Tocqueville suggested that he did not know of any country in the world where there was \u2018less independence of mind, and less true freedom of discussion, than in America.\u2019\n\nA similar verdict was delivered in a now substantially democratic Britain by John Stuart Mill some thirty years later when, in On Liberty (1859), he criticised all democratic societies for their tendency subtly to bully those trying to lead different lives. What he called \u2018the tyranny of the majority\u2019 was in certain ways even worse than the tyranny of an absolute ruler, because \u2014 said Mill \u2014 this tyranny was so righteous in its own eyes. In a famous plea against nosiness and interference of any kind, Mill wrote: \u2018The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.... Over himself, over his body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\u2019 Put another way, Mill and de Tocqueville were pleading for the primordial importance \u2014 even in a democratic society \u2014 of the right to be left alone to be a little weird. Just because an enormous majority, amplifying its thoughts through the mass media, happened to think a particular way, one retained the right to approach matters very differently.\n\nMill and de Tocqueville had realised how easy it is to remain unfree in a democracy. There may be no shackles around one\u2019s legs and one may be politely invited to vote for a leader every four or five years but we may still be fixed rigidly into place by a terror of departing from the majority view, for example, of how to be married or have a career, handle one\u2019s holidays or think of friendship. We are all so much stranger than we allow ourselves to be \u2014 held into place by concepts of normality unjustly formed by strangers to whom we should never have given dominion over our souls. We get interesting only when we start to rattle the bars of our socially enforced cages, but so seldom give ourselves licence to try.\n\nThe heroes of, and guides to, how to live well in a democracy have been certain lively, playful, eccentric figures who felt generous and unthreatened enough by mass society to enjoy its genuine, singular pleasures (they knew how to have fun at the beach and at the nightclub, at the cinema and with a fashion magazine), but who also retained sufficient independence of mind not to be crushed by the will of the majority in its less compassionate or creative moments. They knew how to conform and at the same time rebel.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Portrait of Oscar Wilde, 1895.\n\nSuch heroes might include Virginia Woolf, who took a keen interest in fashion, in popular music, in magazines and films, in new foods and shops. In an essay titled Oxford Street Tide (1932), she delivered an implicit rebuke to George Bernard Shaw, who had said that the survival of civilisation depended on bombing Selfridges, and wrote a paean to shopping in the department stores of her capital: \u2018Oxford Street, it goes without saying, is not London\u2019s most distinguished thoroughfare. Moralists have been known to point the finger of scorn at those who buy there, and they have the support of the dandies\u2026. But as one saunters towards the sunset \u2014 and what with artificial light and mounds of silk and gleaming omnibuses, a perpetual sunset seems to brood over the Marble Arch \u2014 the garishness and gaudiness of the great rolling ribbon of Oxford Street has its fascination. It is like the pebbly bed of a river whose stones are for ever washed by a bright stream. Everything glitters and twinkles\u2026. The great Lords of Oxford Street are as magnanimous as any Duke or Earl who scattered gold or doled out loaves to the poor at his gates. Only their largesse takes a different form. It takes the form of excitement, of display, of entertainment, of windows lit up by night, of banners flaunting by day. They give us the latest news for nothing. Music streams from their banqueting rooms free. You need not spend more than one and eleven three-farthings to enjoy all the shelter that high and airy halls provide; and the soft pile of carpets, and the luxury of lifts, and the glow of fabrics, and carpets and silver.\u2019\n\nVirginia Woolf, c. 1927.\n\nIn Woolf\u2019s novel Mrs Dalloway (1925), the eponymous heroine is no less entranced by the commercial chaos of popular London: \u2018the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands, barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.\u2019 And yet, despite moments of such euphoria, Woolf refused to let majority opinion decide all aspects of her life. She also knew to go against the grain when she needed to: to have lesbian affairs, to live with other couples in surprising arrangements, to defend feminism, to champion unpopular artistic causes, to write difficult books \u2014 and to break down when her emotions demanded it.\n\nA similar freedom attended the life of a figure who would surely have adored (and screenprinted) Woolf if chronology had allowed. Like Woolf, Andy Warhol relished aspects of the mass society he had been born into. He saw nothing wrong with industrially produced food: to him it had made rather than endangered America. \u2018What is great about this country,\u2019 he explained, \u2018is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.\u2019\n\nMuch the same was true of burgers; Warhol repeatedly praised their democratic dignity and bounteousness and their ability to cure homesickness, given that one might have exactly the same branded meal in Rome as in Munich, Taipei or New York. But he would also refuse to take any of it for granted. He wanted to study mass culture, observe it through the eyes of art, and sometimes not just eat hamburgers but make a four-and-a-half-minute film of himself doing so, to stress the surreality and unnoticed bathos of one of modernity\u2019s iconic moments.\n\nAndy Warhol eating a Burger King in J\u00f8rgen Leth\u2019s 66 Scenes from America, 1982.\n\nAnd like Woolf, in other areas of life, Warhol would have the courage to be different, not to do what everyone from Liz Taylor to the President to the soccer mom might think was typical: to live with men, to sleep at odd hours, to have a range of unusual friends, to spend his money heedlessly on things that he especially enjoyed, to wear lipstick and a wig, to cry in front of other men, not to say what everyone else did, to be free inside.\n\nWe may have learnt how to be free at the ballot box. But we are still only at the beginning of knowing how to be free in the depths of our own lives. The challenge of the future will be to throw off the last remaining great yoke: the feudalism of our minds.\n\nAndy Warhol, Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans, 1962.",

      "content": "## 7 Love\n\nIn Book Ten of the Roman poet Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, we\u2019re introduced to one of the world\u2019s more curious but telling myths: a Cypriot sculptor called Pygmalion has developed a problem with women. He has seen the daughters of a local man called Propoetus refuse to honour Venus, the goddess of love, and then turn to prostitution. As a result, he has decided he is \u2018not interested in women\u2019 and devotes himself to his work instead. But, for old time\u2019s sake, he decides to carve a woman out of ivory, shaped into exactly the form he has always longed for. When she is finished, as he gazes up at her nakedness, Pygmalion discovers that he has fallen deeply in love. Bereft at the thought that she is merely a statue, he implores Venus to take pity on him. In exchange for a ritual offering, she turns the ivory figure into a real woman, who awakes and instantly reciprocates Pygmalion\u2019s feelings. They fall into a rapturous kiss and he starts to explore her body (Ovid leaves the rest to our imagination). Soon after, Pygmalion and his lover decide to get married, have a child and live happily ever after.\n\nErnest Normand, Pygmalion and Galatea, 1881.\n\nWhat is striking from a historical point of view is where and when this myth took off: Europe and North America in the second half of the nineteenth century. The story had always been known; now, suddenly, it became venerated. It was the second most painted subject in all of culture in this period \u2014 handled by, among others, Auguste Rodin, Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me (four times), Edward Burne-Jones (five times), and Ernest Normand \u2014 as well as being interpreted by playwrights, songwriters and poets. The story\u2019s popularity wasn\u2019t a matter of chance; it coincided with a movement of ideas, known to historians as Romanticism, that flourished at this time.\n\nRomanticism proposed a very different vision of relationships to that which had existed hitherto. It argued that passionate love was the only possible basis on which two people could form a good relationship: kindness, mild attraction, intellectual sympathy and a commitment to growing old in each other\u2019s company were no longer enough. Nor was one meant to dwell on practical considerations such as views on money, household management, or the opinions of parents; such matters were now deemed \u2018un-Romantic\u2019. Romantics believed that true lovers would understand each other intuitively, without needing to use words; there would simply be a sudden sympathy of souls and a strong feeling that one had always known this person, perhaps in another life. Furthermore, love would be born immediately: one would lay eyes on someone and know at once. Through intuition, one could at a glance locate a person with whom to spend the rest of one\u2019s days. The swifter and more dramatic the process, the safer the relationship was assumed to be. Thinking too much about love was a dangerous sign (and very un-Romantic too). There was certainly no need to have a conversation with one\u2019s lover.\n\nThe Romantics assumed that true love involved a perfect combination of sexual attraction and spiritual sympathy; it was unimaginable that one wouldn\u2019t be very turned on by a partner one loved, or find that one fancied someone whose character one found wanting (along the way, Romanticism turned adultery from a problem into a catastrophe). Romanticism reconfigured love as the entire meaning of life \u2014 not a passing adolescent fantasy or a species of madness, as it had until then typically been considered. No longer did friendship, work, religion, philosophy, hobbies, travel or politics hold out any promises: one\u2019s happiness would be entirely dependent on locating a lifelong soulmate, who would render everyone and everything else superfluous.\n\nOne begins to see why the story of Pygmalion might have been rediscovered by Romanticism. He represented everything that this ideology believed in: his passion developed at first sight; he didn\u2019t need to do any talking; he didn\u2019t have to get to understand his statue-lover; he didn\u2019t bother to find out about her views or aspirations.\n\nEdward Burne-Jones, The Soul Attains, 1878.\n\nJean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, Pygmalion and Galatea, c. 1890.\n\nHe loved her completely and at the same time did not know a thing about her \u2014 beyond her shape. It was going to be forever and involve children, but not even a \u2018hello\u2019 was in order. Beneath a veneer of cultural prestige, the story was close to insanity or, more politely, just very Romantic.\n\nPygmalion\u2019s influence on emotional culture was surpassed by only one other Romantic couple who also became a popular topic for late-nineteenth-century painters: Romeo and Juliet. Romanticism recategorised Shakespeare\u2019s play from being judged among his weakest and most forgettable to his allegedly greatest work. London and Paris were not to be without a performance of the play throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. From a rather pitiful and implausible tale of teenage love, the play was re-evaluated as capturing everything that love was meant to be \u2014 for all people, for all time. The story of the boy and girl from Verona was meant to be a reliable guide to love for university graduates and recently qualified accountants; this was to be the compass by which married couples in Neuilly sur Seine and Leamington Spa were to navigate their emotions. This wasn\u2019t simply entertainment; it was (the gory ending aside) a roadmap.\n\nFord Madox Brown, Romeo and Juliet, 1867.\n\nUnfortunately, Romanticism did not stay neatly within the confines of art and literature; it was not just an intellectual exercise. It began to influence people\u2019s actual assessments of themselves and others. It altered what happened on trains and at parties, in bedrooms and in seaside resorts. One didn\u2019t need to have read Ovid or Shakespeare to be affected; the Romantic influence pervaded one\u2019s mind all the same. Its influence spread to every nation. Romanticism became the official religion of modernity, it filled in for our loss of faith in saints and deities and even encouraged us, not coincidentally, to call our lovers \u2018angel\u2019. The new religion\u2019s victory became total. It could no longer be escaped or even thought about properly. It shaped the instinctive way in which a boy and a girl in downtown Manila might think of their emotions after seeing a film together, or guide a homemaker in Seattle in her assessment of her marriage.\n\nPeople who didn\u2019t feel Romantic emotions learnt to pretend they did \u2014 just to survive \u2014 and might feel that there was something very wrong with them for finding the Pygmalion story somewhat odd.\n\nAlong the way, Romanticism became the single greatest obstacle to our ability to have successful relationships; it became a disaster for love. To get a sense of the hurdles it created, we need only imagine how many problems Pygmalion and his carved wife might have run into in the years after their miraculous union \u2014 and how unprepared the cult of Romanticism would have left them (as it does all of us).\n\nRomanticism works with a charmingly innocent view of our instincts \u2014 and the chances of their reliability. It forgets that what we call \u2018falling in love\u2019 tends to be a process of refinding a love that evokes for us the sort of emotional relationship we knew in childhood, which for many of us involved pain, distance, suffering, neglect and frustration. Our instincts tend to guide us not so much to a pure being who will finally make us happy so much as a troublingly familiar figure who will make us unhappy in just the way we are used to from childhood, and to whom we feel drawn by a psychological impulse to repeat patterns of suffering.\n\nNot only does Romanticism venerate an instinct of which we should be hugely suspicious, it then drains us of any will to get to know our partners properly, because it suggests that we know them already. It makes conversation feel laborious. It associates patient analysis with pedantry: true lovers are meant to communicate by mysterious motions of the soul. The result is that, like Mrs Pygmalion, lovers end up as figments of each other\u2019s over-hasty imaginations.\n\nAbraham Solomon, First Class: The Meeting... and at First Meeting Loved, 1854.\n\nThis in turn leads us to outbreaks of sulking, whereby we become furious with our partners for having failed to understand us for things that we haven\u2019t bothered to explain \u2014 so convinced are we that true lovers simply know what\u2019s in their partner\u2019s hearts. We develop unnecessarily militant views on sex; we imagine that we should be able to be totally honest about our desires but then find that sex and love can sometimes run in opposite directions \u2014 at which point we panic and may call time on otherwise perfectly sound relationships. So bewitched are we by the image of true lovers admiring everything about one another, we fail to see how much of love could be a business of two people gently guiding each other to become better versions of themselves. We insist, often crossly, that a true lover should accept us \u2018for who we really are\u2019 \u2014 a terrifying possibility at any point. We picture love as a feeling of awe at another\u2019s perfection; we don\u2019t remember that it might also be a species of patience and benevolence towards a partner\u2019s frailties and less than admirable dimensions.\n\nNo wonder if the modern age has not only obsessed more about love than any other, it has also failed to help us embark upon and sustain relationships in which we can possibly succeed. The future won\u2019t belong to Romanticism; it will belong to a proper analysis of Romanticism\u2019s flaws, a historical post-mortem out of which will emerge a kinder, more thoughtful, more psychological and more benevolent approach. We will learn to send Pygmalion to therapy rather than the art gallery.\n\nBill Owens, Cleo and James Pruden, from the series Suburbia, 1972.",

      "content": "## 8 Sex\n\nIn sexual matters, the world became modern in early April 1953, on a beach in Cannes, when eighteen-year-old Brigitte Bardot appeared in front of the world\u2019s press to promote her new film, Act of Love (co-starring Kirk Douglas). She was dressed in a small floral bikini, an item of clothing until then seldom seen on camera (it was illegal to show belly buttons on American screens until 1961) and condemned the year before by Pope Pius XII.\n\nBrigitte Bardot, Cannes Film Festival, 1953.\n\nThe French designer Jacques Heim had invented the bikini in 1946, days after the United States had begun nuclear testing on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. He had chosen the name because he predicted that his invention would prove as explosive as a hydrogen bomb. Although it took until Bardot and Cannes for the fuse to light, the bikini and all it stood for did indeed launch a new era. Women around the world shed their old one-piece costumes and, more importantly, many of the bodily attitudes that had gone with them. In 1960, Brian Hyland had a hit with his song \u2018Itsy Bitsy, Teenie Weenie, Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\u2019. Bikinis were centre stage in the film Beach Party of 1963 and again in Bikini Beach of 1964. The Catholic Church gave up the fight, as did film censors and conservative groups. Within a few decades, the bikini seemed always to have been part of a normal \u2014 that is, a \u2018liberated\u2019 \u2014 existence.\n\nThe bikini was not, of course, just an item of clothing. It represented a particular approach to the body and to sexuality: one free of shame and guilt, without the legacy of an embarrassed and repressed past and a herald of exuberance and ease. The bikini reconnected modernity to the pagan freedoms of the ancient Romans and Greeks, who had in their statues, mosaics and Olympic Games known how to feel proud of the body\u2019s beauty and athleticism.\n\nEarly bikinis in Roman mosaics, Piazza Armerina, Sicily.\n\nIt was Christianity that separated Brigitte Bardot from the Romans. The church had waged war on the body for hundreds of years, associating nakedness with the sins of Adam and Eve and making our shame feel like a punishment for the transgressions of our ancestors. That many of us might feel uncomfortable at the sight of our flesh was simply evidence of a fundamental fact about human beings: that we are the descendants of sinners.\n\nThose rare pre-moderns who had dared to try to enjoy a less hampered relationship with their sexuality and their bodies had had to look far beyond Europe\u2019s borders. The nineteenth-century French painter Paul Gauguin, after spending a few months in Provence, a few hours from Cannes, had turned to Tahiti for the paganism that his own prudish country could not provide.\n\nPaul Gauguin, The Delightful Land (Te Nave Nave Fenua), 1892.\n\nFar away from Europe\u2019s top hats and long dresses, he found people who were comfortable sitting under tropical trees in Edenic nudity, with no concept of physical embarrassment. But by 1953, there was no longer a need to go so far. Tahiti had come to France.\n\nThe attempts of the pre-modern world to deal with sexuality can appear, from the post-Cannes world, painful in their degree of evasion, subterfuge and gingerliness. When nineteenth-century doctors first began recommending trips to the seaside on medicinal grounds, the efforts required by women to get themselves into the water without showing their bodies to strangers were as technically impressive as they were psychologically absurd. Horses were used to drive special huts on wheels into the water, inside which women could open a hatch to lower themselves for a bathe. To glimpse so much as a woman\u2019s elbow or shoulder would have been thought an indecency.\n\nWoman sitting on a mobile bathing hut at the seaside, 1911.\n\nSuch contortions were underpinned by a view that sexual desire was the enemy of a sane or good life. It was a species of insanity set within us to tempt and torture us, to derail our sensible routines and to sicken us at ourselves. Except for those very rare moments when one was planning to conceive a child, sexual activity had no place in a dignified existence. What we thought about and did in its name was bestial. Artists and philosophers described battles within each good person between desire on the one hand and chastity on the other. No one could be spared such perpetual civil war, but the moral among us knew which way to settle the issue.\n\nThe Renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino had described two kinds of love. Amor Divinus, or Divine Love, united humankind with the creator of the universe; it inspired gratitude, benevolence, selflessness and devotion to reason. But Amor Ferinus, or Bestial Love, was a means to perpetual masturbation, exhaustion, debasement and perversion. The purpose of philosophy was to persuade students to shift their interests from the latter to the former. But one was left in no doubt as to the scale of the challenge. Sexual desire was framed as a cataclysmically powerful force that could lay waste to the best-prepared plans and the deepest forms of virtue. Aristotle, widely reputed to have been the wisest man of antiquity, was in the Christian era (apocryphally) said to have fallen in love with Alexander the Great\u2019s wife Phyllis, who had punished him for his desire by making him crawl around naked on all fours with a leash in his mouth \u2014 to prove to the unwary just how much stronger lust could be than reason.\n\nVenus, Roman goddess of love, was viewed in Christian times not as the charming embodiment of playful desire she had previously been known as, but as a notorious temptress who could shatter the resolve of the sternest minds on whom she had cast her spell. In a painting in the Louvre from the early fifteenth century, Venus\u2019s vagina is shown emanating rays that simultaneously blind the eyes of six great men: Achilles, Tristan, Lancelot, Samson, Paris and Troilus. It might be very hard to look away; it was even more dangerous not to try.\n\nMaster of the Taking of Taranto, Triumph of Venus Venerated by Six Famous Lovers, Achilles, Tristan, Lancelot, Samson, Paris, and Troilus, c. 1480\u20131500.\n\nThe priority for all those educating the younger generation was to help them to make the right choices in the battle between vice (almost always a beautiful woman) and virtue (almost always a decent but vacillating man). Even in ostensibly good people, there lurked the risk of falling under the influence of the seductive but evil Cupid, ready to fire his arrow and destroy the best of our intentions. For many centuries, desire was not something to enjoy or delight in; it was a trap and possibly a death sentence.\n\nParmigianino, Cupid, c. 1523\u20131524.\n\nTo this grim assessment of desire in philosophy and art, nineteenth-century medicine added a further forbidding layer. In the eyes of the Austrian psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, sex may not directly have been the work of a devil or a devious cupid, but it might as well have been given what it made us do. In his landmark work Psychopathia Sexualis (1886), the most influential book on sex in Europe in the nineteenth century, von Krafft-Ebing focused on the multiple perversities and sicknesses that sex inspired. Though written in sober, detached prose, the book could not hide its distaste at the nature of sexuality: \u2018Love unbridled is a volcano that burns down and lays waste all around it: it is an abyss that devours all \u2014 honour, substance and health,\u2019 noted von Krafft-Ebing in his introduction, then went on to outline hundreds of case studies of the painful and off-beat compulsions bred in us by our sex drives. For example:\n\nCase one: Mr Y, always given to indulgence in sensuality but always with regard for decorum, had shown, since his seventy-sixth year, a progressive loss of intelligence and increasing perversion of his moral sense. Previously bright and outwardly moral, he now wasted his property in concourse with prostitutes, frequented brothels only, asked every woman on the street to marry him or allow coitus, and thus became publicly so obnoxious that it was necessary to place him in an asylum. There the sexual excitement increased to a veritable satyriasis, which lasted until he died. He masturbated continuously, even before others; took delight only in obscene ideas; thought the men about him were women, and followed them with indecent proposals.\n\nOr Case fifty-nine: Mr X, a model husband, very moral, the father of several children, had times \u2014 i.e., attacks \u2014 in which he visited brothels, chose two or three of the largest girls, and shut himself up with them. He bared the upper portion of his body, lay down on the floor, crossed his hands on his abdomen, closed his eyes, and then had the girls walk over his naked breast, neck and face, urging them at every step to press hard on his flesh with the heels of their shoes. Sometimes he wanted a heavier girl, or some other act still more cruel than this procedure. After two or three hours he had had enough. He paid the girls with wine and money, rubbed his blue bruises, dressed himself, paid his bill, and went back to his business, only to give himself the same strange pleasure again after a few weeks.\n\nSigmund Freud, von Krafft-Ebing\u2019s successor, may not have been quite so fastidious in his prose, but his verdict on sexuality was not dissimilar: in his patients, too, sex was for the most part dark, compulsive, strange and a disruption to everything we might seek in a civilised and moral life.\n\nPaolo Veronese, Young Man between Vice and Virtue, c. 1581.\n\nHow refreshing was Brigitte Bardot by comparison; how far from the dark analyses of those two great Austrian doctors or the finger-wagging warnings from Renaissance painters or the dire admonitions of the philosophers. She represented lightness, innocence \u2014 and a return to Eden. Modernity had helped us to fly through the air, cure polio and make calls to other continents; it would also help us to feel natural and happy in bed. We were \u2014 as modern people \u2014 finally to be \u2018liberated\u2019 from hundreds of years of regrettable hang-ups and fears, apprehensions and sorrows.\n\nThe modern age imagined itself to be supremely helpful. Volleyball on the beach in a bikini certainly sounds preferable to being trodden on in a brothel. But arguably, modernity has complicated rather than eased our relationship with sex. The old world knew that sex was difficult. It had no qualms about admitting that it could be embarrassing, that it might make one do things one would regret, that it stood in opposition to certain dignified ideals, that it might be in conflict with love, that it might inspire self-disgust and that one might want to take sensible precautions not to be turned on and not to excite others, for fear of the consequences. These were basic truths taken for granted by all. Though they were certainly melancholy, in many ways they created a useful backdrop against which each of us might navigate and make sense of their own sexual urges.\n\nThe bikini view of sex, though well-intentioned, may leave us ill-prepared for many of the realities of living with a sexual drive. It finds it hard to admit that sex can stand in opposition to anything that seems clean, kind and jovial. It may inspire in us a desire to flog, to debase, to insult, to be roughed up and to say and do things that are contrary to a reasonable self-image.\n\nHans Baldung, Aristotle and Phyllis, 1515.\n\nBy implying that sex should be \u2018normal\u2019, the sunny view can leave us more alone, more confused and more abnormal at those times when sex clearly is not straightforward, when we find ourselves \u2014 as many of us will \u2014 craving activities that have no place in a sensible assessment of human nature, and that although they may not be \u2018sinful\u2019, are certainly dark and peculiar.\n\nNor does the modern bikini view of sex take on board how often desire can be separated from love; how likely it is that, after a while, the person one loves will no longer be the person one wishes to sleep with, and how much strangers, even strangers one might hate or dislike, can compel us to take risks we regret the moment after we have appeased ourselves. The modern view of sex gives us no reassuring narrative about the dark normality of off-beat activities. It doesn\u2019t imply, as those grave Austrian doctors did, that all sex is slightly mad and that we should be well prepared for that fact on our wedding days, instead of taking the complexities, when they develop, as they inevitably will in the course of ordinary monogamous relationships, as some exceptional personal affliction.\n\nThe old world made it hard to discuss sexual issues. The modern world has made it far easier to banter about them \u2014 we are happy to share details of our conquests and lusts \u2014 but left us in no better position to bring up the truly strange sides of our sexuality: the guilt, the fetishes, the very indecent thoughts. Indeed, we may be in a worse position, precisely because we are meant to have been liberated; we are meant to be over the embarrassments and the trepidation. We are meant to be moderns \u2014 clean, vigorous and cheerful. And yet in our hearts, many of us are quietly going out of our minds with sexual aches and experiences that feel as out-of-bounds as anything a medieval monk might have gone through in their most tormented nights.\n\nSex will always be too potent and too radical a force to be so-called normal. It is inherently transgressive. The wisest attitude may be to assume that we cannot return to Eden, and to be suspicious of any narratives of carefree or prelapsarian desire, be they from Tahiti or ancient Rome or Cannes. The working assumption should be that sex has to be difficult; perhaps no sin, but certainly a heavy burden. It is a dynamic at odds with all the sensible other things we are trying to do, such as manage a career, raise children, or simply love someone else kindly and with respect over many decades.\n\nThe future of sex lies less in imagining that it can be rendered simple and innocent than in acknowledging its oddity and preparing for it with courage and dark humour. Cupid isn\u2019t directly firing arrows into us to lead us astray, but there are drives at play in us that will take us shockingly far from where we might want to be if reason were wholly in control. We need a new language with which we can own up to how outlandish and frightening, mesmerising and wicked sex is and will always remain. That would be true liberation.\n\nErnst Ludwig Kirchner, Couple, 1908.",

      "content": "## 9 Loneliness\n\nWhen we think of what might have been lost on the way to becoming modern, we\u2019re liable to think about mealtimes: how seldom they now take place communally, how rare it is for whole families to gather, how much technology can intrude. In paintings of communal meals that reflect the older way of doing things, we can appreciate how all ages used to come together around a table, what a joy the home-prepared food was, and how welcoming the atmosphere seems to have been. Even the family horse might have been invited to join in.\n\nFrederick George Cotman, One of the Family, 1880.\n\nSwanson\u2019s Frozen Turkey TV Dinner, 1954.\n\nThe modern condition appears infinitely bleaker by comparison. Rather than a family around the hearth, the emblematic image is of a single person with a tray on their knees in front of the television. It was the Swanson Corporation, originally a poultry producer from Omaha, Nebraska, that launched the frozen TV dinner in 1954, the same year colour television was introduced in the United States. The dinner came with two slices of turkey breast, sweet potatoes, buttered peas and cornbread dressing. The company had plans to sell 5,000 in the first year; in the event, they sold ten million. In the coming years, Swanson made a number of innovations to their solitary meals. They produced a fourth compartment for the tray, typically filled with apple or peach slices in syrup. There were turkey sausages and chicken escalopes, \u2018lean beef in natural gravy\u2019, a German tray (\u2018with a generous helping of sauerkraut, sp\u00e4tzle and Bavarian red cabbage\u2019) and a Thanksgiving edition (with \u2018a little something extra to cheer about \u2014 tangy cranberry sauce. Hooray!\u2019). It may have been a short distance in time, but it was a long way in spirit from Norman Rockwell\u2019s laughter-filled family Thanksgiving celebration to Swanson\u2019s sequestered industrially produced meal for one (\u2018Just heat and serve\u2019).\n\nNorman Rockwell, Freedom from Want, c. 1941\u20131945.\n\nModernity is surely a lonelier place than the world that preceded it. The question is why. Frozen dinners are an easy target \u2014 but these precisely engineered trays are more likely to be symptoms of our unease about solitude than causes of alienation in themselves. It isn\u2019t ultimately technology (cities, cars or screens) that have made us lonely; it\u2019s an identifiable set of ideas. Being on one\u2019s own doesn\u2019t have to be problematic, demeaning or say anything sinister about one\u2019s character, yet we have made this the equation. Loneliness does not arise simply because one happens to be physically isolated; it is caused when our culture encourages us to feel a sense of shame at being so. We have rendered ourselves lonely because of certain stories we have told ourselves about what loneliness means.\n\nMost eras before our own knew that solitude didn\u2019t have to be a sign of wretchedness or deficiency. There were ways of being on one\u2019s own that could be filled with honour and an impression of communion with what is noble and sincere; physical isolation could be accompanied by a strong sense of connection with a god, a person in a book, a piece of music or a quieter part of one\u2019s own mind. One could be alone and at the same time not feel isolated or damned \u2014 just as one might be surrounded by family and yet feel painfully unseen and unheard.\n\nIn the early history of Christianity, it was believed that true sociability didn\u2019t involve chatting to whomever happened to be in the vicinity (our blood relatives or people we went to school with). It meant being connected to the most satisfying sources of meaning in the universe. That might require going to live by oneself somewhere very remote, a hut in the woods or a tower on a cliff, and learning to commune with God and his love and wisdom. In a cave, with only a Bible for company, and hours to connect to scriptural ideas, one might end up feeling less isolated than in a bustling but spiritually vacuous household. In the fourth century, the greatest saint of early Christianity, Saint Anthony, was said to have spent more than forty years by himself in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert, not saying a word, eating only bread and salt. He communed with God in what was known as a \u2018hesychasm\u2019: a contemplative prayer in which a believer attempts to still everything about themselves, even their breathing, over many hours, to come closer to the immeasurable mysteries of God. Some were so impressed with Saint Anthony\u2019s life that they came to join him in the desert, camping out in nearby caves, growing their beards and hair and writing down their thoughts and visions. They became collectively known as the Desert Fathers, and their philosophy of asceticism and solitary piety would go on to found the monasteries: institutions that, in succeeding centuries, ritualised and codified the solitary faithful life. At the height of monasticism in the Middle Ages, a million people across Europe and North Africa chose to forego the bustle of family and commerce in order to dwell, in some of the most rugged and remote terrain in the world, in silent contemplation of the beauty of the divine spirit.\n\nHieronymus Bosch, The Temptation of Saint Anthony, c. 1450\u20131516.\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Reformation and the destruction of the monasteries that accompanied it, solitary piety began to lose its prestige and recede as a practical option. Those who had previously lived alone at the tops of mountains were now encouraged to serve God by remaining in the community, finding a suitable spouse and starting a family. There was an increasing sense that to be solitary might slide over into selfishness or be evidence of an overzealous mind.\n\nTo this newly social religious perspective was added the influence of Romanticism, a movement of ideas that \u2014 with different ends in view \u2014 similarly encouraged people to give up on thorough commitments to their own company and questioned the honour of solitude. For the Romantics, happiness lay in identifying one exceptional soulmate to whom one could surrender one\u2019s independence and with whom one might fuse mind and body. With a genuine lover by one\u2019s side, one would never again need to feel sorrow or dislocation. One would at last understand one\u2019s purpose and appreciate one\u2019s place: one would have come home.\n\nThe Romantics painted a moving portrait of coupledom \u2014 and thanks to their artistry and the examples of their own lives, they convinced the modern world. But in the process, the Romantic movement had a catastrophic effect on our assessment of what it might mean to remain by ourselves. Romanticism turned solitude from a respectable and profound choice to evidence of pathology. Through the lens of Romanticism, it seemed that there could be no reason why a person might opt to be by themselves other than being in some way emotionally diseased or sexually deviant. \u2018Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give,\u2019 explained the Romantic (and four-times married) philosopher Bertrand Russell. It sounded encouraging. It was also, beneath the surface, a threat.\n\nBy propagandising successfully on behalf of conjugality, Romanticism guaranteed that those who were on their own would doubt their goodness and sanity \u2014 and might end up a great deal more isolated than a Desert Father after half a century of silence in the Nitrian Desert. With seeming innocence, Romantics drip-fed stories of loving couples and their joys. Like Christianity, Romanticism had its saints and holy figures, its epic poems and sacred books. There were lovers like Abigail Adams and her husband John, second President of the United States, whose cosy and endearing relationship was widely held up by the Romantics as an example of what marriage could be for everyone (as opposed to a charming fairy tale, about as rare and representative as becoming president).\n\nAbigail and John Adams, buried together, Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nHusband and wife remained close for fifty-four years, wrote to each other five times a day when they were apart (their collected correspondence runs to 1,160 letters) and knew everything about one another from their political and religious ideas to their tastes in soup, gloves and favourite songs. On her deathbed in 1818, Abigail was reported to have said to her husband: \u2018Do not grieve, my friend, my dearest friend. I am ready to go. And John, it will not be long\u2019 (it would in fact be eight years). The suggestion was that good people were not only to be in couples in this life, they would also be so in the next one \u2014 a point further enforced in the nineteenth century through the habit of burying couples in double crypts or vaults. Singlehood was no longer a decent option for the living \u2014 or, it appeared, the dead.\n\nRomanticism didn\u2019t just make single people feel freakish; it massively increased the pressure on anyone already in a couple who couldn\u2019t lay claim to extreme contentment. It made those who were quietly muddling along and politely putting up with some less-than-ideal habits and routines feel lonelier and more cursed than they had ever done. For most of history, no one had expected couples to be very content; forbearance and compromise had been praised as the true achievements. One was doing very well if one managed not to actively despise one\u2019s partner after a few decades. But under the new influence of Romanticism, anything but perpetual ecstatic transport appeared to be a violation of the ground rules of existence. One wasn\u2019t meant to be in the business of merely tolerating a person. Settling with someone because they were \u2014 all things considered \u2014 really not so bad, because it was convenient, because they had a kind face and a sometimes friendly manner, all this became a heresy as severe as anything that might have been condemned by the early Christians at the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325.\n\nThe nineteenth-century (publicly very happily married) Romantic artist, William Quiller Orchardson, was typical in his condemnation of any hint of compromise in his satirical work of 1883, The Marriage of Convenience. To find one\u2019s partner a little boring and hard to talk to at dinner (even while one appreciated the services of the butler and the comfortable dining room and liked raising children together) was not an understandable and on balance fair enough eventuality in a good-enough relationship; it was a pitiful tragedy.\n\nWilliam Quiller Orchardson, The Marriage of Convenience, 1883.\n\nRomanticism trapped the human race in a double bind: by framing singlehood as psychologically impossible, it encouraged us to panic and accept marriage proposals that it would have been wiser to resist. At the same time, by suggesting that ongoing fascination and bliss were the norm within every decent relationship, it made most couples feel as if they had gone badly wrong.\n\nThe tensions came to a head in Britain after the First World War. Following the huge loss of life in the conflict, a census revealed that women now outnumbered men by 1.75 million. The newspapers spoke in alarmed voices of \u2019two million surplus women.\u2019 There was no sense that not getting married offered on balance as many opportunities and sorrows as getting married; there was no admission that there might be loneliness in both camps and that being unmarried might on occasion be preferable. The \u2018war spinsters\u2019, as they became known, were treated with a mixture of derision and charity. An Overseas Emigration Committee was set up with the purpose of encouraging single British women to travel to distant parts of the Empire to escape the ignominy of a solitary life at home. For a generation thereafter, the \u2018spinster\u2019 or \u2018maiden aunt\u2019 was a stock character to mock and feel sorry for. It simply seemed inconceivable that one could have a tolerable life with no husband.\n\nWhen the Beatles released \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 in 1966, the song that defined what loneliness meant for the modern age, it was at once clear why Eleanor was a pitiful figure. The famous face that she kept in a jar by the door had been intended for the enchanting partner that, like all single people, she must have longed to find. Only with romantic love could there be a decent life: so ran the philosophy of the song, of all the Beatles\u2019 works and, in fact, of every pop song every written. Fail to fall completely in love and, Romanticism warned, one would soon enough be picking up rice in the church where a wedding had been \u2014 or, rivalling Eleanor for strangeness \u2014 the comparably odd Father Mackenzie, around whom there seemed so little of the glamour that had once attended the Desert Fathers. The modern world not only made it mandatory to have a partner, it made it feel essential to have a vibrant gang of friends and to enjoy seeing them regularly at parties. Opportunities for large-scale socialising grew with the development of electric lighting, restaurants, dance halls and bars. Weekends were newly devoted to going out, and an otherwise unknown form of anxiety began to grow if, as Saturday evening approached, one realised one had nowhere in particular to go in the fun-filled city. An empty diary became an emblem of deformity.\n\nNewspapers were filled with reports of the social lives of others. One could find out who had attended Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s fortieth birthday party and what had been served at Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Rothschild\u2019s Proust Ball; which was the most beautiful dress worn at The Met Gala and how Valentino had arranged the seating plan at his White Fairy Tale Love Party. But more importantly, we were being schooled in the notion that to be respectable was to love going out; that there was no glamour in staying in with a book and no value in collecting one\u2019s thoughts in a diary or turning over one\u2019s memories of childhood in a hot bath. There was no admission that it might be a curious way of living up to one\u2019s ideals of community to stand in a crowded room full of status-panicked, socially anxious people, every one of them terrified of honesty or failure, where the only possible answer to how one was doing was a vigorous \u2018Absolutely terrific \u2014 and how are you?\u2019.\n\nElizabeth Taylor\u2019s 40th birthday, 1972.\n\nIn 1921, Carl Jung, in his book Psychological Types, had introduced the terms \u2018extraverted\u2019 and \u2018introverted\u2019 to divide humanity. The former referred to a sort of person who could best realise their potential in the company of others; the latter were those who needed to move away from crowds and idle chatter in order to regain their integrity. \u2018Everyone possesses both mechanisms,\u2019 wrote Jung, but it was evident where the spirit of the age resided. The modern world belonged firmly to the extraverts, while the introverts were left at home to feel as if what they most enjoyed \u2014 being by themselves \u2014 was a disease. In order to feel less lonely, most of us don\u2019t need to be pushed into going out or given yet more encouragement to track down perfect lovers; we need society to change its stories about what solitude can mean. We need to shift the associations we have been given, away from failure and freakishness and towards depth and discernment. Feeling that one doesn\u2019t want to stand in a loud room chatting with people, that one wants to have a simple meal on one\u2019s own, that one wants to be left with a pad of paper, that one wants to walk in nature; these are not signs of madness but evidence of a complex and rewarding interior.\n\nPhoebus Levin, The Dancing Platform at Cremone Gardens, 1864.\n\nA few artists of the modern period have made a case for the other side, speaking up with confidence and skill for introversion, and trying to coat solitude in glamour. In a painting by the nineteenth-century German artist Caspar David Friedrich, we are invited to trust that the lonely figure in the landscape is no outlaw or brigand; he is privy to insights that would be lost in the crowd down in the lowlands. He has travelled up to the mountains to put the bluster and envy of humans into perspective; on his own, the wanderer can be returned to the most significant parts of himself. We might dare to follow him in his trajectory.\n\nCaspar David Friedrich, Landscape with Mountain Lake, Morning, c. 1823\u20131825.\n\nIn the art of the French painter Jean-Baptiste Corot, solitude is not some poor alternative to company; it\u2019s not what one might turn to only when one has been rejected from a gala dinner or one\u2019s prospective husband has been killed in battle. Solitude is a paradise from which every noisy greeting, every superficial remark and every insensitive encounter is a painful rupture we should be proud to resist.\n\nJean-Baptiste Corot, The Solitude, Recollection of Vigen, Limousin, 1866.\n\nThe young woman in the portrait by Welsh artist Gwen John does not seem to belong to any official religion. But if there were one dedicated to the appreciation of solitude, she would be one of its icons. Her expression \u2014 kind, gentle, melancholy and lost in profundity \u2014 is an advertisement for all that modernity has neglected in its promotion of active, cheery lives.\n\nGwen John, Young Woman Holding a Black Cat, c. 1920\u20131925.\n\nSeparated by eight decades, the leading figure in Hannah Starkey\u2019s photograph of a diner seems similarly to make an eloquent case for isolation. The setting may be bleak, but the picture is not. It allows us to remember, and better hold on to, our own experiences of solitude, when being by ourselves isn\u2019t some form of punishment, but a chance to digest griefs, to recentre ourselves and to escape a world always clamouring for us to join in its raucous enthusiasms and sentimental moods. There may be others, outside the scope of the camera lens, in the caf\u00e9 on their own, men and women having a cheese sandwich or a Coke by themselves, similarly lost in thought, similarly distanced from society. Theirs is a common isolation with the beneficial effect of lessening the oppressive sense within any one person that they are alone in being alone. Isolation does not have to be a particular malediction; it is where good people tend to end up.\n\nHannah Starkey, Untitled, October 1998, 1998.\n\nWe should feel proud to be the descendants and the spiritual twins of the people in the great solitary works of art. We should dare to believe that we are in solitude not because there is anything wrong with us but because we are noble of spirit; because our ideals of sociability are high. We don\u2019t hate company; it\u2019s just that we would prefer to stay home rather than accept the counterfeit tokens of community presently on offer.\n\nThe way to make people feel less alone is not to pull them out of their musings in the forest or in the diner, in the library or the desert and force them to go bowling. It\u2019s to reassure them that being alone is no sign of failure. To lessen modernity\u2019s crisis of loneliness, we need for solitude to be rehabilitated and for singlehood to regain its dignity. There is nothing catastrophic about eating dinner, many dinners, on our own. The Swanson TV dinners might have been capable of improvement, but it is ultimately far better to be eating a basic meal in peace than to be in a ballroom surrounded by false smiles and oppressive judgements. When we do so, we aren\u2019t on our own at all. We are \u2014 as modernity has failed to remind us \u2014 dining with some of the finest, most elevated spirits who have ever lived. We are, though ostensibly by ourselves, in the very best company.",

      "content": "## 10 Work\n\nFor most of history, work was not a topic of sustained reflection because it seemed so simple, so inevitable and so unpleasant. It was overwhelmingly focused on the provision of basic food and shelter and offered next to no stimulation or spiritual reward. At best one could describe it as a backbreaking and desperate curse.\n\nThe modern age begins with hope. By the eighteenth century, work had diversified, certain trades were growing more prosperous, and others less exhausting. Humans began to step back and ask themselves questions: how was work organised, what was it for, and what might be its future? There was a new self-consciousness and inquisitiveness. The French Encyclop\u00e9die, which set out to condense all human knowledge and was published in thirty-two volumes between 1751 and 1772, devoted a third of its entries to work. With the help of elegant forensic illustrations, it described hundreds of occupations in unusual depth. There were substantial entries on pipe-organ making, turning and lathe work, baking and sugar refining, paper-making and bookbinding, tanning and soapmaking, mining and metallurgy, porcelain and pottery manufacture.\n\nThere was a childlike fascination to the entries. Humanity was waking up to how beautifully specific and skilled its labours could be. There were workers who understood exactly how to manipulate the forty different kinds of tool required to make a saddle; an everyday object like a bed emerged as a piece of intricate engineering demanding admirable degrees of training and experience. The production process of Gruy\u00e8re cheese proved more interesting than most novels.\n\nTwo hundred years later, in a comparable spirit of investigation, the American photographer Bill Owens travelled around Southern California, photographing an eclectic range of people at their work, then married up their portraits with their reflections on their activities. The tone was less heroic \u2014 much of the work we do remains minor, bathetic and disconnected from higher ambitions \u2014 but it conveyed an equal fascination with the devotion and sacrifice our labours demand.\n\n\u2018At Dirty Sally Night Club I earn $80 a night on tips. Everyone is here to have a good time at the disco, drink and pick each other up. The outfit is just a part of the job. It helps me get better tips and I am careful not to get too familiar with the customers.\u2019 Bill Owens, Working, 1976.\n\nIn the modern world, we understand so much about who we are at work, but we still grapple with questions of what work is, and what it might properly aim at. We\u2019re still in search of a philosophy of work. We might begin like this: what we call \u2018work\u2019 are all the efforts we make to compensate for what nature doesn\u2019t automatically or easily provide us with. We work to reduce particular sorts of pain and increase particular sorts of pleasure that nature did not, on its own, take care of. The history of work is the record of all the techniques and processes we had to devise to make life more bearable: nature did not provide sufficient food on trees and in bushes and so we started to plant seeds; nature left us shivering in our natural state and so we began sewing. Every time humans encountered a failing in nature, they tried to invent a tool; every tool is an instrument to extend our command over an indifferent environment in the service of our needs. When we hear the word \u2018tool\u2019, certain sorts of objects tend to come to mind: we couldn\u2019t carry sufficient quantities of water in our cupped hands, so we devised the bucket; we couldn\u2019t deliver enough force in our fists to smash a stone so we invented the hammer.\n\n\u2018As a theoretical physicist I generally don\u2019t tell people what I do. It\u2019s useless explaining because, unless you know about the subject, it\u2019s mysticism. Some of my mathematical problems take a year or more to solve. I carry them around with me. So really I\u2019m working all the time, even when I\u2019m in bed.\u2019 Bill Owens, Working, 1975.\n\nBut if we define a tool as anything we create because nature hasn\u2019t granted us a power to act in a particular way on the world, far more things are tools than the simple mechanical objects we tend to associate with the term. A book is a tool to correct our inability to hold a great number of our ideas in memory; a painting is a tool to preserve an impression of the beauty of the night sky or the underside of clouds at dusk; a holiday is a tool to organise a succession of satisfactions relating to a foreign climate or culture; a religion is a tool to foreground certain ideas of morality and consolation that might otherwise disappear from our vacillating minds. \u2018Civilisation\u2019 is the summary of everything we have ever devised to counteract the harshness, affliction and discomfort of our natural condition.\n\nThe centuries show humans learning to invent an ever more complicated range of tools to address ever more subtle and complicated needs. We have moved from developing tools for simple aspects of survival to tools that address our aspirations to flourish. Along the way, we made a striking discovery: that coming up with and operating certain tools might be pleasurable. This was a surprise. For most of our time on Earth, work had been no fun at all: it had been repetitive, physically arduous and mentally unstimulating, which is why the aristocratic assumption had always been that, once money allowed, one would down tools at once and devote oneself to leisure. No rich person would ever think of continuing to work in order to address the needs of others. But at the dawn of the modern world, humanity became conscious of forms of work that, even while they generated money through being useful to others, also stimulated and rewarded those who undertook them. One might please oneself and one\u2019s audience. Satisfying work begins with an insight into happiness. What later gets called an enterprise, a profession or a trade is at the outset just an idea about increasing pleasure or decreasing pain. We start the long journey towards work when we spot something that we would like others to enjoy, or a friction or discomfort we want to remove from their lives. For example, we notice how interesting it tastes when a sandwich is made with a particular variety of oil and lemon. Or we see how stimulating the very old and the very young find it to spend time together and wonder how they could do so more regularly. Or we spot that there is a height above the knee where a hem hangs that is especially beguiling. An insight into happiness could begin when we think of combining two earlier disconnected attempts to please: perhaps a delicate high voice can be married up with a deep bass set within a piece of music the length of a choral mass. Maybe the way they handle wool in Norway can be twinned with the way they treat metal in northern Italy. Or we can be challenged to deepen a sort of happiness that is already present but in a relatively undeveloped form. Perhaps a comedian\u2019s routine could be taken to a new level if it could also expound some leading ideas from science. Or we are struck by an impediment to happiness that irks us especially: why do we need to spend so much time filling out forms, why can\u2019t the system automatically reorder a part, couldn\u2019t we arrange it so that the machine would leave no residue?\n\nThe unattended pleasure we identify might be very personal and apparently little known. It can require courage to imagine that it could ever matter to other people, that our secret satisfactions and frustrations might have direct equivalents inside strangers. Successful work requires taking an intelligent guess about the lives of the audience. \u2018In the minds of geniuses,\u2019 wrote the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u2018we find our own neglected thoughts.\u2019 And one could add, in perceptive businesses, we find our own neglected pleasures and pains addressed. They know us better than we know ourselves, what we call profit being the reward for understanding an aspect of human nature ahead of the competition.\n\n\u2018I got tired of selling waterbeds so I opened a beanbag store. Water-beds were just a fad.\u2019 Bill Owens, Working, 1976.\n\nBut an insight into happiness is not yet work. Work is everything we need to do to turn insights into stable, nameable, reproducible and ultimately tradeable things; to turn a particular kind of berry exposed to the sun into the tool we call a jam, a particular harmony into the tool we call a song, to turn a sequence of ideas into the tool we call a college course. Every pleasure needs to be \u2018worked on\u2019, farmed, pruned, cultivated and arranged into an assembly line.\n\nWhen we think of all work as a matter of tool-building, the distinction between art and commerce disappears in an illuminating way.\n\nIn the 1880s, the largely deserted, rugged coast of Normandy was visited by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet. He was particularly attracted to the cliffs near the village of \u00c9tretat.\n\nClaude Monet, \u00c9tretat, the Beach and the Porte d\u2019Aval, 1883.\n\nMany local people and one or two rare visitors must occasionally have thought that this was a charming place as they drew up a fishing boat on the sand or collected the iodine-rich kelp. What distinguished Monet is that he sought to place his pleasures on a solid footing. He waited for hours from a variety of vantage points until just the right sort of light emerged from the reflections thrown up by the crashing of the waves \u2014 and then tried to arrest, fix and render more tangible his pleasure in a series of tools we now call \u2018Impressionist paintings\u2019.\n\nBut receptive antennae, highly attuned to pleasures and pains, are not the exclusive possession of the people we call artists. Another way of capturing the beauty of the cliff faces of Normandy was pioneered by entrepreneurs who raised loans from Parisian banks in order to construct imposing static tools for appreciating views of cliffs \u2014 complete with large plate glass windows, bellboys and balconies \u2014 that we call in shorthand \u2018hotels\u2019.\n\nHotel d\u2019Angleterre, \u00c9tretat, France, c. 1860.\n\nIt\u2019s in the nature of most tools that they can\u2019t be made alone. Work is touching to behold when we see a wide variety of people, of different ages and temperaments, physical builds and capacities, united by a single aim; for example, when a gruff handyman, dour accountant, cheery instructor, bland marketing agent, severe government inspector and temperamental cook all come together to create the tool we call a school or a kindergarten. Given what we know of human nature \u2014 how conflictual, tricky and individual we can be \u2014 it is redemptive to see that we are also capable of laying aside our differences in the name of a unitary mission. Each of us considered singly may not be impressive, but we can rise to the grandeur of the projects we collectively engage in: a cathedral turns the humblest stonemason into a servant of the sublime.\n\nAt the same time, our work gives us an opportunity to escape from some of the normal difficulties of being ourselves. It imposes a requirement that we be \u2018professional\u2019, which might sound inauthentic and deceptive, but can provide a welcome alternative to the intractable difficulties thrown up by our deeper selves. For a few hours, via our work, we can lay aside the doubts and agonies of our inner lives and experience a simpler, more one-dimensional but also more decisive and logical way of being. We can enjoy a professional atmosphere where not everyone feels it their duty to be an uncensored correspondent of their every mood. After an emotionally turbulent weekend, we may welcome Monday morning for the more straightforward image it returns us of ourselves.\n\nAt its best, work allows us to park what is most valuable about us \u2014 most creative, sensible, kind, perceptive \u2014 in an object or institution that is more stable and accomplished than we are. We may vacillate, get cross, fall into doubt, behave pathetically \u2014 but with any luck, the tool we make will ultimately bear no trace of our weaknesses. The good tool gives no hint of the frailties of its maker. The very definition of sound working products is that they should be better than the people who made them. They should also ideally not fall apart so easily. We have to die, but they might go on, continuing to deliver pleasure or alleviate pain when our name has long been erased. Work can constitute a victory of sorts over the forces of entropy and extinction.\n\nAll this said, there is so much that can stop us from finding the work that would help us flourish. We might not have the courage to think about what is missing from the world or to follow any of our insights into the nature of happiness. We might fall back on a feudal mindset in which we assume that some people are allowed to develop their vision and others, by some arbitrary rule, are not. A hard, submissive childhood may school us in resignation. Without any plans, increasingly afraid of survival, we may panic and fall prey to the plans of others, losing sight of the contours of our own mission.\n\nThe education system does not help: for years, we are given instruction in a random range of skills but without an overview of what our lives might really amount to and what work is ultimately about. We aren\u2019t helped to fathom what we in particular are interested in and how this might map onto what is possible in the world. We lack a decent career counselling service that could combine detailed explanations of available work with help in understanding our faint and untrained signals of enthusiasm. We are in need of a service that could track down the fertile zone in which the needs of the world and our aptitudes connect, a service to highlight the spark of genius inside every one of us \u2014 so that we might one day contribute to a tool that counts and die without so much regret.\n\nThe pain of modernity here, as in so many other fields, is that we have raised expectations without teaching ourselves how we might meet them; we have left ourselves unaided in a painful intermediate zone between expectation and reality. We need no longer toil like our ancestors. We have the right to discover the tools that could redeem us even as we diminish the sufferings and raise the pleasures of strangers.",

      "content": "## 11 Individualism\n\nThe world became modern when people who met for the first time shifted from asking each other (as they had always done) where they came from \u2014 to asking each other what they did.\n\nTo try to position someone by their area of origin is to assume that personal identity is formed primarily by membership of a geographical community; we are where we are from. We\u2019re the person from the town by the lake; we\u2019re from the village between the forest and the estuary. But to want to know our job is to imagine that it\u2019s through our choice of occupation, through our distinctive way of earning money, that we become most fully ourselves; we are what we do.\n\nThe difference may seem minor, but it has significant implications for the way we stand to be judged and therefore how pained the question may make us feel. We tend not to be responsible for where we are from. The universe landed us there and we probably stayed. Furthermore, entire communities are seldom viewed as either wholly good or bad; it\u2019s assumed they will contain all sorts of people, about whom blanket judgements would be hard to make. One is unlikely to be condemned simply on the basis of the region or city one hails from. But we have generally had far more to do with the occupation we are engaged in. We will have studied a certain way, gained particular qualifications, and made specific choices in order to end up, perhaps, a dentist or a cleaner, a film producer or a hospital porter. And to such choices, targeted praise or blame can be attached.\n\nIt turns out that in being asked what we do, we aren\u2019t really being asked what we do but what we are worth \u2014 and, more precisely, whether or not we are worth knowing. In modernity, there are right and wrong answers; the wrong ones swiftly strip us of the ingredient we crave as much as heat, food or rest: respect. We long to be treated with dignity and kindness, for our existence to matter to others and for our particularity to be noticed and honoured. We may do almost as much damage to a person by ignoring them as by punching them.\n\nRespect will not be available to those who cannot give a sufficiently elevated answer to the question of what they do. The modern world is snobbish. The term is still associated with a quaint aristocratic value system that emphasises bloodlines and castles. But stripped to its essence, snobbery merely indicates any way of judging another human whereby one takes a relatively small section of their identity and uses it to come to a total and fixed judgement on their entire worth. For the music snob, we are what we listen to; for the clothes snob, we are our trousers. And according to the job snobbery at large in the modern world, we are what is on our business card.\n\nJames Gillray, Following the Fashion, 1794.\n\nThe opposite of a snob might be a parent or lover; someone who cares about who one is, not what one does. But for the majority, our existence is weighed up according to far narrower criteria. We exist in so far as we have performed adequately in the marketplace. Our longing for respect is only satisfied through the right sort of rank. It is easy to accuse modern humans of being materialistic. This seems wrong. We may be interested in possessions and salaries, but we are not on that basis \u2018materialistic\u2019. We are simply living in a world where the possession of certain material goods has become the only conduit to the emotional rewards that we crave deep down. It isn\u2019t the objects and titles we are after; it is, more poignantly, the feeling of being \u2018seen\u2019 and liked that is only available to us via material means.\n\nNot only does the modern world want to know what we do, it also has some punitive explanations of why we may not have done very well. It promotes the idea of \u2018meritocracy\u2019 \u2014 a system that should allow each person to rise through classes in order to take up the place they deserve. No longer should tradition or family background limit what one can achieve. But the idea of meritocracy carries with it a nasty sting: if we truly believe in a world in which those who deserve to get to the top do get to the top, by implication, we must also believe in a world in which those who get to the bottom deserve to be at the bottom. In other words, a world that takes itself to be meritocratic will suppose that failure and success in the professional game are not mere accidents, but indications of genuine value.\n\nDorothea Lange, Migrant Mother, 1936.\n\nIt has not always felt quite so definitive. Pre-modern societies believed in the intervention of divine forces in human affairs. A successful Roman trader or soldier would have thanked Mercury or Mars for their good fortune. They knew themselves to be only ever partially responsible for what happened to them, for good or ill, and would remember as much when evaluating others. The poor weren\u2019t necessarily indigent or sinful; the gods might never have looked favourably on them. But we have done away with the idea of divine intervention \u2014 or of its less directly superstitious cousin, luck. We do not accept that someone might fail for reasons of mere bad luck. We have little patience for nuanced stories or attenuating facts; narratives that could set the bare bones of a biography in a richer context, that could explain that though someone ended up in a lowly place, they had to deal with an illness, an ailing relative, a stock market crash or a difficult childhood. Winners make their own luck; losers make their own defeat.\n\nNo wonder that the consequences of underachievement feel especially punishing. There are fewer explanations and fewer ways of tolerating oneself. A society that assumes that what happens to an individual is the responsibility of the individual is a society that doesn\u2019t want to hear any excuses that would less closely identify a person with elements of their CV. It is a society that may leave some of the losers feeling that they have no right to exist. Suicide rates rise.\n\nIn the past, in the era of group identity, we might value ourselves in part for things that we had not done ourselves. We might feel proud that we came from a society that had built a particularly fine cathedral or temple. Our sense of self could be bolstered by belonging to a city or nation that placed great store on athletic prowess or literary talent. Modernity has weakened our ability to lean on such supports. It has tied us punitively closely to what we have personally done \u2014 or not done.\n\nAt the same time, the opportunities for individual achievement have never been greater. Apparently, we are able to do anything. We might amass a fortune, rise to the top of politics, write a hit song. There should be no limits on ambition. Therefore, any failure feels even more of a damning verdict on who we are. It\u2019s one thing to have failed in an era when failure seemed like the norm, quite another to have failed when success has been made to feel like an ongoing and universal possibility.\n\nEven as it raised living standards across the board, the modern world has made the psychological consequences of failure harder to bear. It has eroded our sense that our identity could rest on broader criteria than our professional performance. It has also made it imperative for psychological survival that we try to find a way of escaping the claustrophobia of individualism, that we recall that workplace success and failure are always relative markers, not conclusive judgements, that in reality, no one is ever either a loser or a winner, that we are all bewildering mixtures of the beautiful and the ugly, the impressive and the mediocre, the idiotic and the sharp. Going forward, in a calculated fight against the spirit of the age, we might do well to ask all new acquaintances not what they do but what they have been thinking or daydreaming about recently.\n\nNicolaes Maes, The Account Keeper, 1656.",

      "content": "## 12 A Quiet Life\n\nFor most of history, societies have equated good lives with active and outwardly noisy ones: lives spent spearing enemies in battle, sacrificing oneself heroically in the name of God, achieving high office and fame, amassing riches and honours, and becoming known for artistic and scientific breakthroughs. To this, the modern age has added its own demands. A good active life should involve commercial success, a wide circle of friends, frequent foreign travel, close knowledge of a number of cities, awareness of leading ideas in art and technology, a sense of fashion, viewership of recent drama series and, almost inevitably, a twice-weekly high-intensity workout.\n\nIt now seems odd to argue for something else, what one might call a quiet life, a life where one lives outside of an expensive urban centre, where one works to satisfy material needs and intellectual curiosity but without frenzy or emotional craving, where one might only intermittently check the news, rarely travel very far, almost never go out in the evenings, stay in touch with just a few friends, spend a lot of time in nature, exercise by going for walks, eat simply (mainly fruit and vegetables), seldom buy anything expensive, disregard most new books, and strive always to be in bed by ten.\n\nThe modern world makes sure that we know at all times just how much we might be missing. It is a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) are inevitable. We hear of defined centres where the most exciting things are happening. At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin, in the coming years, it might be Auckland. There are books that have to be read and films that must be seen. There are people we should be visiting and opportunities that we must not pass up. It can feel like a privilege, until we become aware that it is in reality a coercion.\n\nArt has tracked and nurtured our noisy enthusiasms. Traditionally, most works displayed the exploits of brave aristocrats, usually in battle, and the dramatic and self-abnegating feats of religious figures. There were strong-jawed men on horseback and haughty ladies in profile, saints ascending to heaven and Biblical heroes defending virtue against Satan.\n\nYet as the world became ever noisier, a minority tradition emerged with a new mission in mind: opening our eyes to the unexpected charms of ordinary, modest lives. The pioneers were the artists of the seventeenth-century Dutch republic. In the canvases of Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch, there are no military processions or divine annunciations. There is something far braver and more redemptive: people like us, doing simple, important, normal things, sweeping the yard, putting away the laundry, checking the kids\u2019 hair for nits and getting supper ready.\n\nErasmus Engert, A Garden in Vienna, 1828.\n\nIt was the genius of the Dutch artists to demonstrate that there might be as much opportunity for bravery, good sense and kindness in a kitchen or a yard as on a battlefield or in a royal palace. They have been joined in subsequent centuries by artists comparably interested in the everyday: the quiet interiors of Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, the gardens of Erasmus Engert, the moments captured in the photographs of Jessica Todd Harper.\n\nJessica Todd Harper, Becky in the Den, 2003.\n\nIn his The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), the English academic Robert Burton \u2014 a spiritual cousin of the Dutch artists \u2014 wrote in praise of the person who is \u2018freed from the tumults of the world... seekes no honours, gapes after no preferment, flatters not, envies not, temporizeth not, but lives privately and well contented with his estate\u2026. He is not troubled with state matters, whether kingdoms thrive better by succession or election; whether Monarchies should be mixt, temperate, or absolute; the house of Ottomons and Austria is all one to him\u2026 he enquires not after Colonies or new discoveries\u2026. He is not touched with feare of invasions, factions, or emulations.\u2019 This might have been a manifesto for Vermeer or de Hooch, Engert or Harper.\n\nDefenders of quiet lives know that there are, of course, special things going on in the noisy world, but they do not let the obvious signs of glamour be their guide to these. The novel they might really need to read is almost certainly not currently winning prizes or in the bestseller lists. It may have been written 200 years ago and be available mostly in second-hand editions. They know that what is precious can be jumbled up with uncomplicated and straightforward things. Great intelligence may not be accompanied by academic qualifications. A deep conversation can be had with a relative who likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dyeing their hair. The defenders of quiet lives are themselves scared of missing out, but they have a rather different list of things they are afraid of not enjoying: their children growing up, empty days without commitments, truly getting to know their parents, the sky at dusk, long baths, and early mornings in the kitchen with the cat.\n\nThe quiet understand how much can be drawn out of a single experience, if one takes the time to turn it over in one\u2019s mind. A trip taken ten years ago isn\u2019t really over. So much of it remains unattended in memory: the light on the first morning by the harbour, the little museum with the geraniums in the courtyard, the tomato salad by the forest\u2026. Nothing ever disappears, it\u2019s just waiting for the outer world to still before yielding its riches. We would need to experience so much less if we knew how to draw appropriate value from what we had already done and seen. Our impulse for constant movement may at heart be a confession of an inability to process. We feel the need for so many new experiences because we have been so poor at absorbing the ones we have had.\n\nWere we to be good travellers, we would know how to treat a walk to the shops as its own kind of precious adventure. We might grow a little more like curious four-year-olds who constantly stop, every few paces, to take in a new and extraordinary sight: a weed growing between two bricks, an oddly shaped cloud with a silvery tail, a contrail between two warehouses, a dog looking pensively at a bunch of daffodils, a piece of graffiti on a lamp post, a fishmonger\u2019s window with Dover soles and John Dorys resting on ice. It is rare to pay any of this attention when one has larger ambitions in view. But the quiet know that, contrary to all expectations, this may in fact be the centre of existence. Life is not elsewhere; this is what one would miss were it to end soon.\n\nThe quiet are not simply quiet out of appreciation, but also out of caution. They understand the toll that noisy lives exact. They know \u2014 perhaps better than those who maintain crowded diaries \u2014 how prone we are to exhaustion, over-stimulation and collapse. They may even have lived through a breakdown themselves, when a few too many responsibilities and excitements, late nights and emotional dramas inducted them brutally into how fragile our hold on reason can be. They are living quietly to guard against folly and paranoia, anxiety and despair. They appreciate how much unglamorous routines and night after night by themselves or one or two very close friends protects them against the return of delirium.\n\nVilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, Interior with Young Man Reading, 1898.\n\nIt is easy to measure how much money we are making. It\u2019s much harder to notice how much calm we have lost. We don\u2019t keep a close eye on the true price of our noisy lives; we don\u2019t properly add up what the business trip or the conference might have done to our levels of serenity and creativity or to our relationship with those who truly matter to us. We don\u2019t notice how agitated every newspaper article makes us feel and how dispiriting every encounter with a false friend can prove. We are like early scientists handling uranium without a sense of the dangers. We don\u2019t notice what a shock to our sensitive minds it is to step into a room full of raucous acquaintances and to try to make small talk for a few hours with a frenemy. This is an experience it might take a month of quiet evenings to heal. We don\u2019t understand that insomnia is our minds\u2019 revenge for all the thoughts we have managed not to have in the day and our anxiety is a bid for us to pay heed to our neglected sensitivity.\n\nGood parents have a handle on the dangers of over-exhaustion in young children. They know that after some bright lights and dancing, jokes and games, it will be time for a nap. They know the tell-tale signs of tetchiness and a catastrophising mindset. We take no comparable care with our equally fragile temperaments. Modern society has few visible adults reminding us that it might be enough now; it remains up to us to make the superhuman efforts required to put ourselves to bed.\n\nPieter de Hooch, A Mother Delousing her Child\u2019s Hair, c. 1660\u20131661.\n\nAn ordinary life is heroic because ordinary-sounding things are never actually ordinary or easy to manage. There is immense skill and true nobility involved in bringing up a child to be reasonably independent and balanced; maintaining a good-enough relationship with a partner over many years despite areas of extreme difficulty; keeping a home in reasonable order; doing a not very exciting or well-paid job responsibly and cheerfully; listening properly to another person and, in general, not succumbing to madness or rage at the paradox and compromises involved in being alive.\n\nWe have probably already had enough excitements for many lifetimes. We have seen enough people, gone to enough places, bought enough things. We need to stop the forces of the modern world from continuing to draw us away from our true home. There is no centre, there is no party to which we have not been invited. There is just us, here, now, somewhere on the pale blue dot, doing our best, surrounded by unobtrusive beauty, with a too-often unknown need to rejoin the silence and reopen our minds to vastness \u2014 and, along the way, to start going to bed earlier.",

      "content": "## 13 Busy-ness\n\nIn the last two hundred years, the world has witnessed the greatest increase in productivity in the history of humanity. From 1 CE to 1820, living standards in the West slowly doubled, rising from a GDP per person of $600 a year to $1,200. Then, over the next 200 years, it catapulted up by a factor of more than twenty, to stand at over $26,000.\n\nNot only have we become more productive, we have also acquired a sense of what being productive should look like: being in an office, surrounded by a lot of people, attending meetings, travelling a lot and answering many, many messages. But we may be in danger of missing out on what the most fruitful kind of work actually requires.\n\nIn so far as the world advances through ideas and clarity of thought around the large first order questions, some of our most productive moments will have little in common with the scenarios envisaged by the modern religion of hard work. They will be quiet, outwardly idle moments in which we\u2019ll have the opportunity to break through clich\u00e9d assumptions and received ideas, in which something vital and authentic will surge through our minds and in which we\u2019ll have the courage to take a neglected intuition seriously or give an opposing point of view the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn these moments, we\u2019ll realise how little time we have left on Earth and will use the feeling of panic to orient us towards what we really want and have known for a long time already needs to be done.\n\nParadoxically, it can be hard to do this sort of thinking in the expected locations. Familiar places breed familiar thoughts. Surrounded by a hundred colleagues, an original vision can feel inappropriate. Thinking is also hard when thinking is all we\u2019re meant to be doing. A blank sheet of paper on a brisk Monday morning can panic the mind into silence. The best sort of thinking emerges when we have no set agenda, in the hollows of the day, when we are just walking around the park or taking a train journey, having a bath or staring blankly into space. It is then that our best, but also most furtive, thoughts may be lured out of the unconscious and can be glimpsed by reason before they run away again.\n\nThere is a discomfiting aspect to many of our important ideas; they would, if taken seriously, often entail an element of disruption. We might have to make changes to the way we do things; we might have to upset people and correct now false assumptions. This doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t take such thoughts seriously, but it explains our deep temptation not to. We are much better at executing plans than stepping back to evaluate whether the plans are the right ones. We can be geniuses at working out the thousand small steps required to advance a project, but poor at giving ourselves the time and space to figure out whether the project was ever even relevant.\n\nIf we had the strength to disagree with the harried conditions of modern work, we might come to recognise that a quiet room in mid-afternoon, when we have nothing pressing to do till supper, no one to see and no messages to reply to, might be among the most productive places we could allow ourselves to be. We would recognise the profound value of spending hours staring out of the window, ostensibly \u2018wasting time\u2019 but in reality perhaps generating thoughts that would spare us years of confusion and error. The figure in Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i\u2019s painting might look as if she was doing \u2018nothing\u2019, but some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful and instead tap into the creative power of reverie and free association. Window daydreaming is a strategic rebellion against the excessive demands of immediate pressures in favour of the slow development of more substantial plans.\n\nVilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, Interior, Strandgade 30, 1905.\n\nWe are encouraged to be hard on ourselves for our \u2018lazy\u2019 moods; inactivity can feel like a sin against the bustling activity of modernity. However, it might be that the real threat to our happiness and self-development lies not in our failure to be busy, but in the opposite scenario: in our inability to be \u2018lazy\u2019 enough. Outwardly idling does not have to mean that we are neglecting to be fruitful. It may look to the world as if we are accomplishing nothing but, below the surface, a lot may be going on that\u2019s both important and in its own way arduous.\n\nRamon Casas, Decadent Young Woman. After the Dance, 1899.\n\nWhen we\u2019re busy with routines and administration, we are focused on those elements that sit at the front of our minds: a to-do list of tasks both urgent and, ultimately, unimportant. But it is to the deeper, less accessible zones of our inner lives that we have to turn in order to understand the foundations of our problems and arrive at decisions and conclusions that can govern our overall path. Yet these only emerge \u2014 tentatively \u2014 when we are feeling brave enough to distance ourselves from immediate demands; when we can stare at clouds and follow the movement of tree branches. Someone who looks active, whose diary is always filled, may appear the opposite of lazy. But secretly, there may be a lot of avoidance going on beneath the outward frenzy. Busy people evade a different order of undertaking. They are practically a hive of activity, yet they don\u2019t get round to working out their real feelings about their work. They constantly delay the investigation of their own direction. They are lazy when it comes to understanding the purpose of their lives. Their busy-ness is a subtle but powerful form of distraction \u2014 in fact, a kind of laziness.\n\nOur lives might be more balanced if we learnt to reallocate prestige. We should think that there is courage not just in travelling the world, but also in daring to sit at home with our thoughts, risking encounters with certain anxiety-inducing or melancholy but also highly necessary ideas. The heroically hard worker is not necessarily the one in the business lounge of the international airport; it might be the person gazing without expression out of the window, and occasionally writing down one or two ideas on a pad of paper. That might be the hard work that will properly honour our potential.",

If we were to show an ancestor from several hundred years ago around our cities and suburbs, they would be amazed at our technology, impressed by our wealth, stunned by our medical advances \u2014 and shocked and disbelieving at the horrors we have managed to build. Societies that are, in most respects, far more advanced than those of the past have managed to construct urban environments more dispiriting, chaotic and distasteful than anything humanity has ever known. To find our way out of the paradox, we need to understand its origins. There are at least six reasons for the ugliness.",

      "content": "### 1 The War on \u2018Beauty\u2019\n\nSince the dawn of construction, it was understood that the task of an architect was not only to make a building serviceable, but also to render it beautiful. That would involve a host of manoeuvres above and beyond pure material necessity. In the name of beauty, an architect might add a band of coloured tiles above the windows or a line of sculpted flowers over the door; they might try to create symmetry in the front fa\u00e7ade, or carefully ensure that the windows got proportionally smaller on every storey.\n\nEven if the construction were a practical one, such as an aqueduct or a factory, architects would strive to give it a pleasing appearance. The Romans understood that a water-pumping system might be as beautiful as a temple; the early Victorians felt that even a factory could have some of the aesthetic properties of an elegant country house; and the Milanese knew that a shopping arcade could carry some of the ambitions of a cathedral.\n\nGalleria Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan, 1877.\n\nThe Pont du Gard aqueduct, N\u00eemes, 60 CE.\n\nBut when architecture reached modern times, beauty became taboo. The architects of the modern movement waged a war on what they now described as the effeminacy, wastefulness and pretention of all previous \u2018beautifying\u2019 moves. In an essay called \u2018Ornament and Crime\u2019 (1910), the Austrian modernist Adolf Loos argued that to decorate a building with anything \u2018pretty\u2019 was a sin against the true profession of the architect, which he now redefined in purely functional terms. Loos\u2019 modernist colleague Le Corbusier proposed that only undecorated buildings were \u2018honest\u2019, and that all thoughts of beauty were a betrayal of the true mission of architecture, which was only to create watertight functional structures. As modernism declared: \u2018Form must follow function\u2019 \u2014 in other words, the appearance of a building should never be shaped by a consideration for beauty; all that should matter is the basic material purpose.\n\nAt the outset, this seemed liberating. The nineteenth century had produced some very over-decorated buildings, in which the beautifying impulse had reached a decadent stage.\n\nAt the same time, many early modernist buildings \u2014 especially those for wealthy clients \u2014 were elegant in a way that felt novel and cleansing, like eating a kiwi fruit after too much chocolate cake. It seemed that the dictum that form should follow function was about to release a highly attractive new kind of architecture on the world.\n\nMies van der Rohe, Barcelona Pavilion, 1929.\n\nUnfortunately, the dream quickly turned sour. When property developers heard that the artistic avant-garde was now promoting a concept of functionalism, they rejoiced. From the most high-brow quarters, the most ungenerous motives had been given a seal of approval. No longer would these developers have to spend money on anything to do with beauty. Out could go the symmetry, the flowers, the nice but slightly more expensive materials. It could all be as quick, ugly and cheap as possible; after all, isn\u2019t that what the great minds of architecture had advised? In no time, what had started as an interesting niche idea had become justification for vast suburbs and commercial districts completely devoid of charm. Sheds and brutal boxes abounded.\n\nIn any case, the modernists hadn\u2019t even been honest about what they were doing. They might have proposed that all they were interested in was \u2018function\u2019, but in reality, the great ones, like Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe, agonised over each element of their building. They were \u2014 in secret \u2014 as interested in visual charm as their predecessors. They had merely wanted to create a stir by presenting themselves as clean-cut, rigorous, engineer types, but they had remained artists.\n\nThis nuance was lost on the property developers who came after them. Their constructions were not elegantly pared down with grace; they were sloppy, mean-minded and ugly. Except that now, because of the words of the modernist masters, there was apparently nothing one could do to charge them with a dereliction of duty. The concept of beauty had been rendered old-fashioned; it seemed elitist and woolly. No one could complain that beauty was missing from the world without sounding soft-headed. Modernity became ugly because we forgot how to articulate that beauty is, in the end, as much of a necessity for a building as a functioning roof. We lost the vocabulary to describe our pain.",

      "content": "### 2 No one knows what\u2019s attractive anyway\n\nThe ugliness of the modern world rests on a second intellectual error: the idea that no one knows what is attractive in architecture. In the pre-modern world, it was widely assumed that there were precise rules about what made buildings pleasing. In the West, those rules were codified in a doctrine known as \u2018Classicism\u2019. Created by the Greeks and developed by the Romans, Classicism defined what elegant buildings should look like for more than 1,500 years. Recognisably classical forms were present all over the West, from Edinburgh to Charleston, Bordeaux to San Francisco.\n\nThomas Jefferson Rotunda, University of Virginia, 1826.\n\nGradually, polite disagreement broke out. Some people made a case for other styles; for example, for the Gothic way of building from the Middle Ages. Others argued for Islamic architecture, or for Chinese, Alpine or Thai styles. A diversity of buildings appeared around the West along with debates about how it might be best to build.\n\nIn time, the debates were resolved in a way that was intellectually respectful but that provoked some very bad practical consequences. It was decreed that, in matters of visual taste, no one could really win the argument. All tastes deserved a hearing. There was no such thing as an objective standard. Attractiveness in architecture was evidently a multifaceted and subjective phenomenon.\n\nOnce again, this was music to property developers\u2019 ears. Suddenly, no one would be allowed to describe a building as \u2018ugly\u2019. After all, taste was merely subjective. You and your friends might dislike a new district, a democratic majority might even loathe it, but that was only a personal judgement, not an edict one had to heed. Cities grew ever uglier, but no one was allowed to say that there was such a thing as \u2018ugliness\u2019. After all, isn\u2019t taste just personal?",

The job of an architect was to turn out a building roughly like all the other buildings in a district and to do so politely and on time; it was certainly not to express a distinctive personality, emphasise their differences or make a splash. As a result, most districts of most cities looked very alike. You couldn\u2019t really tell who had done what building and it didn\u2019t matter (just as it doesn\u2019t especially matter who baked a loaf of bread). Architecture was beautifully impersonal and repetitive.\n\nBut in the early twentieth century, a troubling idea came to the fore: that the architect was a distinctive individual with a unique vision that needed to be expressed in all its fancifulness in order to appease a restless creative spirit. To ask an architect to fit in with everyone else was as stifling as asking a poet to type out the tax code.\n\nRafael Vi\u00f1oly, 20 Fenchurch Street, more popularly known as the Walkie Talkie, 2015.\n\nThis might have been a liberation for certain architects, but society as a whole has paid an enormous price for this creative release. Suddenly, architects competed to create the most outlandish and shocking forms as if to prove their distinctiveness and worth. It was understood that one could make a name for oneself not by turning out dignified and unassuming buildings but through outrage and peculiarity.\n\nThe world forgot that \u2018originality\u2019 is as unwelcome in architecture as it would be in bakery or brain surgery. One isn\u2019t looking for constant shock and surprise; one wants predictable rules and harmony. We lost our ability to say that what we really craved was buildings that looked a bit like they had always done; buildings that wouldn\u2019t require one to wonder who designed them.\n\nCapital Gate, Abu Dhabi, RMJM, 2011.",

When you had to get around on foot or at best on horseback, it paid to keep things close together. Furthermore, it was safer, because invaders might attack at any time, and it was crucial to ring your town with a wall, adding further impetus to keep everything well arranged inside, like a compact cutlery drawer or a toolkit.\n\nBut without anyone quite noticing, with the spread of cars in the 1920s, the pressure to use space neatly evaporated. One could now lounge on the earth, or sprawl lazily across it. Highways could meander between towers, bits of scrubland and scatterings of warehouses. The nervous and precise among us who like things to be neatly lined up, who are disturbed when a picture is slightly askew or the knife and fork are not equidistant from the plate, grew ever more sorrowful.",

First, as a general rule, one cannot go very wrong with natural materials. You have to try very hard to make an ugly stone or wood building; it\u2019s difficult to build very high in them for a start, so your eyesore is guaranteed a certain modesty. And the inherent organic beauty of timber and limestone, granite or marble attenuates any errors at the level of form. Second, it can help to orient us and connect us to particular places if they don\u2019t look like they could be anywhere on the planet, if Jerusalem is built in one sort of stone and Bath in another.\n\nBut modernity introduced glass and steel, out of which large and imposing structures could quickly be formed, and it suggested that it would be as daft to have local architecture as it would be to have local phone or bicycle design. The argument once again forgot about human nature. When we say that a building looks like it \u2018could be anywhere\u2019, we\u2019re not praising its global ambitions, we\u2019re expressing a longing for a building to remind us of where we are.\n\nManila, Phillippines.",

At its most acute, the places we live in determine the sort of people we can be.\n\nIn a degraded environment, however safe and rich our material lives, our spirits will sink. We take our cues from what the buildings around us \u2018speak about\u2019. If they speak of grace and charm, kindness and light, our mood will be buoyant; if, however, they seem to threaten and intimidate us, we will feel humiliated and cowed. Modernity has had little respect for our fragility. It has imagined that, so long as the roof didn\u2019t leak, we could dwell among buildings of unsurpassed ugliness and not lose our will to live.\n\nBologna, Italy.\n\nWe cannot blame poverty for the ugly world we have built. It used to be a reassuring assumption that money would eventually assure beauty for all. But modernity has taught us a darker lesson: that what ultimately makes for good architecture are sensible ideas and that we have built an ugly world out of stupidity, not lack of resources.\n\nIt\u2019s a stupidity we pay dearly for. A dumb book or song can be shelved and disturb no one. A dumb building will stand defacing the Earth and upsetting all who must look at it for hundreds of years. On this basis alone, architecture is the most important of the arts \u2014 and, to enforce the problem further, the one we are never taught anything about in school.\n\nAs a result of our lack of education, we don\u2019t hold our governing classes to account. We don\u2019t know how to articulate our distaste for ugliness politically. We have been taught how to say we want a richer world, a fairer world, or a greener world.\n\nWe are still stumbling in how to clamour that we also want a more beautiful world. The promise of modernity had been to make the most important things available cheaply to all: no longer would lovely food or clothes, holidays or medicines, be just the preserve of the rich. Industrial technology would open up quality for everyone. But, paradoxically, one key ingredient we all long for has been rendered more exclusive than ever through our inability to think clearly. The one thing we can\u2019t appear to mass produce is beautiful architecture.\n\nAs a result, what nice architecture there is, most of it built before 1900, is hugely oversubscribed and costlier than it ever was at the height of the aristocratic age, while the few pleasant streets that remain collapse under a weight of tourists. We have democratised comfort and made beauty exclusive. The challenge is to remember our longing for beauty and to fight the forces of modernity that would keep us from acting on it.\n\nOCBC Bank, Singapore, 1976.",

      "content": "## 16 Perfectionism\n\nPart of our problem as a species is that we are troublingly good at making things perfect. We can set our minds on an extraordinary goal and \u2014 with heroic sacrifice, thousands of hours of effort, many wrong turns and periods of intense despair \u2014 reach the target. We can pull off a masterwork, we can exceed all normal expectations, we can triumph and awe \u2014 and advance humankind.\n\nIn many fields, it appears we\u2019re getting ever better at reaching perfection. What we call the modern age has witnessed an unparalleled increase in the number and scale of our achievements, from technology to cookery, hostelry to sport, fashion to medicine.\n\nTo begin a list of these, in aviation, we launched the perfect passenger plane, the Airbus A350 in 2013; in football, Brazil\u2019s Carlos Alberto kicked the perfect goal into the Italian net in the 1970 World Cup final; in engineering, Michel Virlogeux designed the perfect bridge to span the Tarn valley in southern France in 2004; Coco Chanel introduced the perfect black dress in 1926; Jonas Salk and his team at the University of Pittsburgh designed the perfect vaccine for polio in 1952; Dieter Rams designed the perfect radio, the RT20 Tabletop, for Braun in 1963; the Swiss graphic designer Adrian Frutiger designed the perfect font \u2014 Univers \u2014 in 1957; the baker Pierre Herm\u00e9 designed the perfect pastry in 2005, the 2000 Feuilles Pralin\u00e9, made of piedmont hazelnut and thin layers of Brittany cr\u00eape dentelle; in 1989, Intel released the perfect microprocessor, the 80486; W.H. Auden wrote the perfect poem, \u2018Mus\u00e9e de Beaux Arts,\u2019 in 1938; Rutherford made the perfect analysis in physics with his model of the atom in 1911; Aman opened the perfect hotel, the Aman Giri, in Utah in 2009; Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel of Genesis wrote the perfect song, \u2018Firth of Fifth,\u2019 in 1973; Eric Rohmer made the perfect film, The Green Ray, in 1986; and Stephen Shore took the perfect photograph at the Causeway Inn, Tampa, Florida in 1977.\n\nStephen Shore, Ginger Shore, Causeway Inn, Tampa, Florida, November 17, 1977, 1977.\n\nIt is of little use telling a species like ours that aiming hard for perfection might be impossible or inadvisable; that perfectionism, the grasping and aching for the transcendent and the flawless, might be a foolish quest \u2014 as the final chords of Bach\u2019s Dona Nobis Pacem echo around King\u2019s College Chapel or the cargo doors of the Space Shuttle Atlantis open to release the Galileo spacecraft, on its way to map the moons of Jupiter. Nevertheless, it\u2019s crucial to insist: the quest for perfection \u2014 uncritically held up as a collective goal by the modern age \u2014 carries grave dangers. We may all have perfect moments, we may all pull off perfect feats, but no one who has ever walked the Earth can ever have a perfect life.\n\nAnd yet we keep being surprised by the point. At the more sublime end of the spectrum, we read biographies of great artists and scientists, chefs and engineers, and profess to be surprised when we hear of ugly divorces and selfish friendships, distasteful politics and poor parenting. We somehow keep expecting that a human can be as perfect as what they create; we don\u2019t seem to understand that the reason why perfect objects and achievements have such a hold on us is precisely because we are, as a race, and as individuals, inherently imperfect. We would not be so moved by the music of Bach or the poetry of Baudelaire if this level of perfection were our usual home.\n\nOur tears tell us a crucial fact: both that perfection is what we aspire to and also that it is something we only ever have a tenuous hold on. We cannot dwell on the icy brilliant peaks \u2014 we might ascend to them at rare moments, but our real dwelling place is in the marshy lowlands and the murky forests. We have feet of clay and, only very rarely, damaged angels\u2019 wings.\n\nIt\u2019s this duality that the modern age has left us so confused about. It has generalised outwards from humanity\u2019s most heroic feats. It has tried to democratise genius and inspiration, talent and goodness, leaving us to imagine that human life itself might be a perfectible phenomenon, merely awaiting a few more discoveries and technical innovations before every crease has been ironed out and the pathway to a brightly lit, immortal zone is laid down.\n\nIt sounds kind, but the effect may be catastrophic, for we suffer dearly at an individual level from our collective dreams. How insufficient and humiliated we feel in a perfectionist world to be only ever that most modest of creatures: us \u2014 with all our flaws, compulsions, errors and absurdities, that can strike as unforgivable as we survey them in the restless hours of another damnable night. What we need are reminders that being the way we are was always the only possibility; that to stumble and miss, to regret and to understand too late are inherent features of the patchily evolved and largely foolhardy animals that we are.\n\nOther eras, more primitive than our own in their technologies and less graced with achievements of perfection, understood the point better than we do. The ancient Greeks created the artistic genre we know today as \u2018tragedy\u2019 to remind themselves that the highest humans, the greatest warriors and statesmen, poets and orators, were in the end all profoundly flawed \u2014 and never more than when they failed to accept that they might be so. The blood-soaked stories of tragedy that unfolded on stages across the Peloponnese told of errors of judgement, blind spots, excessive tempers and stubborn sides of character that unwound the lives of able and admirable people. The moral was clear: no one escapes the general law of humanity, that we cannot get through this life without significant lapse and misdeed, that we are innately inadequate and damaged. True wisdom begins the moment we fully take this on board about ourselves and others; from that position can spring self-forgiveness, pity and compassion.\n\nEugene Delacroix, Medea, 1838.\n\nThe message from the Judeo-Christian tradition was just as solemn and cautionary. No human can ever be perfect and that to imagine that such a thing were possible is to offend the very laws of the universe. There is only one perfect being, and our brief high points are only ever the result of his grace. For the theologian Saint Augustine, writing in the dying days of the once proud Roman Empire, every human is marked by the taint of \u2018original sin\u2019. The phrase is dated, peculiar but enormously useful. The transgressions of Adam and Eve mean that all their descendants, not just this or that unlucky one but all of us, cannot expect to lead perfect lives. We are sinners casting around for redemption.\n\nThe Buddhists, thousands of miles away, though at a similar time, made an identical point. For them, too, life was a conclusively imperfect journey, marked by suffering, riddled with delusion and fallacy. To remind themselves of this, Zen in Japan initiated an artistic tradition that identified the distinctive beauty in imperfect things: lopsided pots still marked by the craftsman\u2019s hands, roof tiles stained with rain, garden paths overgrown with moss, rainy days in which the pine trees appear only fleetingly through bands of mist.\n\nTo sense the gap between the more perfectionist sensibility of the West and the more modest attitudes of the Zen Buddhist potters, we need only compare an ideally symmetrical soup tureen from the royal S\u00e8vres Porcelain workshop with a tea bowl from Japan in the same period. The soup tureen is quietly certain that life is a perfectible journey; as we ladle our vegetable consomm\u00e9, it delivers a sermon on ideals of balance and harmony; but in Japan, as we raise an endearingly misshapen cup of green tea to our lips, we\u2019re hearing a perhaps yet more valuable lesson about the need for a gracious accommodation with our unruly and fractured selves. We may have made some perfect things; but we should never expect of ourselves what we would expect from an object, let alone a scientific formula, a rocket or a song. We should not judge ourselves by the standards of our finest creations.\n\nTea bowl, Japan, nineteenth century.\n\nS\u00e8vres Porcelain tureen, c. 1861\u20131864.\n\nTo counter the temper of modernity, a philosophy of imperfectionism should be applied across our lives. In relationships, it could become the bedrock of tolerance and good humour. A person who announced themselves on an early date as a creature of near perfection \u2014 and improving every day \u2014 would raise alarm bells: they will swiftly prove insufferable and always remain hard to know. A sense of another\u2019s reality emerges when we can admit to our mutual vulnerability and fear.\n\nWhat we seek in love is not so much a perfect being as someone who can warn us of their multiple flaws with insight, in good time, so that we might strive to adapt and accommodate \u2014 as they would for us. On the receiving end of love, we crave not so much for someone to be awed by us as for them to see our failings clearly and yet to treat us with generosity and warmth.\n\nJan Gossaert, An Elderly Couple, c. 1520.\n\nAt work, a philosophy of imperfectionism might prepare us for how long anything halfway decent will take to produce. We cannot expect the novel, business plan, painting or power station to be right immediately; we should budget for frustration and therefore be readier to take the inevitable reversals in our stride. What ends up looking perfect will, and must, demand long periods when it feels ugly, confused and beyond rescue. We would not give up so easily \u2014 because we never expected things to be other than hellish.\n\nIn relation to ourselves, a philosophy of imperfectionism inspires the kind of self-compassion that keeps people out of hospital. Of course we\u2019ve messed up large sections of our lives, missed crucial opportunities and done ridiculous things. It is hard for anyone with imagination to look back and not feel intense distress at who they have been. But there is a difference between taking responsibility for our errors and feeling that these must place us beyond redemption.\n\nTo believe in human perfection isn\u2019t a bracing way to achieving ever higher standards; it\u2019s a path to breakdown and, at moments of serious mishap, suicide. There is nothing wise about failing to accept of what modest stuff we\u2019re made.\n\nFinally, a philosophy of imperfection is what small children hunger for. The English child psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott was struck by how many of the parents he saw worried that they had not been perfect in their roles: they admitted guiltily to having been sometimes tired, intemperate, disinterested and cynical. Winnicott playfully congratulated them. Children with perfect parents, he remarked, are on the road to psychosis. The task of a parent is not to be perfect, he explained, it is to prepare a child as gently but as thoroughly as possible for the deeply imperfect conditions of life: to help these idealistic small people to accept that frustration is endemic, that bowls fall off tables and shatter, that teddy bears lose their eyes, that car journeys are too long, that parents are astonishingly annoying, that Mum is daft and Dad a fool, that there is too much homework, that many experiences are bitter and that everyone eventually gets old and dies. More than that is not required, insisted Winnicott \u2014 in Playing and Reality, a book published in 1953 (the year colour television, a marvellously perfect box, was invented). In his famous formulation, a parent only needs to be \u2018good enough\u2019. We can be good enough parents, workers, spouses, friends and humans; that will be sufficient.\n\nThe modern world has done us an enormous service in encouraging us to raise our ambitions; it is in danger of creating mass psychosis by failing to remind us clearly enough that we are also \u2014 invariably and continuously \u2014 silly, mistaken and beautifully ridiculous.\n\nAmedeo Modigliani, Seated Woman with Child (Motherhood), 1919.",

      "content": "## 17 Science and Religion\n\nAccording to a standard heroic secular account, at the start of the modern age and in just a few short decades, science was able to defeat religion through rigour and brilliance \u2014 and thereby forever liberated humankind from ignorance and superstition. For centuries, this account explains, religion had essentially been doing some very bad science. It had purported to tell us how old the Earth was (4,000 years old), how many suns there were in the universe (one), how evolution had begun (by divine decree), and why rainbows existed (to remind us of God and Noah). But these lamentable attempts were finally put to an end when science was able to investigate reality with reason, assert itself against obscurantist priests, and drive religion into the cobwebbed attic in which it presently resides. Science did not so much replace religion (there was no need) as expunge the scourge altogether from human consciousness. As a result, we can now dwell without fear or meekness and enjoy the fruits of science and its constant, ever more astonishing, technological discoveries.\n\nThe story is seductive in its robustness and has a pleasingly victorious feel. But it may not be true. It willingly (and cleverly) misrepresents the purpose of religion, first by positioning it as an entity whose overwhelming focus has been to do pretty much exactly what science does \u2014 understand \u2014 and then by pointing out that it happened to do it very badly. Whereas science was wise enough to proceed with a battery of telescopes, pipettes, centrifuges, measuring gauges and equations, religion tried to interpret the workings of the universe with the help of one (in passages obviously demented) ancient book.\n\nHowever, in truth, religion was never really interested in doing the things science does. It might have thrown out the odd theory about geology, it might occasionally have had things to say about meteorology or aeronautics, but its focus was never substantially on explanations of physical reality. It cared about a mission altogether different and more targeted: it wanted to tell us stories to make life feel more bearable. It was interested in giving us something to hold on to \u2014 in the face of terror, shame and regret, when there was panic and grief \u2014 that could help us to make it through to the next day. It offered us ideas with which we might resist the pull of viciousness and self-centredness. It hoped to encourage us to find perspective and lay a claim to serenity in the face of our too-often impossible and tragic mortal condition.\n\nThe defenders of science purported to miss all this, simply framing religion as a flawed and daft pioneering version of physics, chemistry and biology. But from the start of the nineteenth century, prescient observers understood that religion had always been something besides this, that it had taken care of the inner life of humanity and that its retreat would therefore have implications for far more than our grasp of physical reality. Though we might benefit from a hugely enhanced understanding of lightning or the features of the night sky, we might simultaneously be in danger of losing our central resource for coping with the agonies of existence. With only science to hand, what would happen to our need for consolation? What would we do with our night-time terrors? How could we reconcile ourselves to our mortality? Where would we be able to find peace and a semblance of contentment?\n\nScience largely shrugged its shoulders. This was not its business; nor did these questions seem particularly pressing to many in the field. But others \u2014 perhaps more tormented and inwardly fragile \u2014 disagreed: they knew that whatever the state of scientific knowledge, humans never lose their need for stories that can make life feel more bearable. Knowing the boiling point of hydrogen (-252.87\u00b0C) will not mean that we promptly shed our appetite for consolation or perspective; understanding the structure of the atom in no way lessens our craving for something mature and psychologically soothing to hold on to in the middle of the night. For a rare period, this double need \u2014 for the consolations once offered by religion and for the truths revealed by science \u2014 was artfully held together in a way that it has never quite been before or since. In England, for three decades around the middle of the nineteenth century, from a variety of quarters, there was a range of highly suggestive attempts to rope aspects of science into the project of ethical and psychological healing pioneered by religion. These projects sought to mine science for its capacity to do precisely what religion had done so well for centuries: to guide us towards greater self-acceptance, serenity, forgiveness and peace of mind. Rather than dismissing the central functions of religion, science could, from this vantage point, skilfully and intelligently replace them.\n\nThe highpoint of this unusual approach was the foundation of two new institutions: Oxford\u2019s University Museum of Natural History in 1860 and London\u2019s Natural History Museum in 1881. Both set out to present the public with the latest discoveries of science: they showed off a treasury of vertebrates and invertebrates, rocks and minerals. They laid out stuffed bears, foxes and lions, bones of whales and megalosauruses, cabinets of rose-ringed parakeets and birds of paradise. One could peer at the preserved bodies of black seadevil fish and stoplight loosejaws (Malacosteus niger). There were fossilised ammonites and the imprints of brachiopods and (in London) 22,000 drawers filled with beetle specimens.\n\nYet the public wasn\u2019t merely being given a lecture; it was being invited to find inspiration \u2014 not unlike the kind one might once have discovered in the annals of religion. The architecture made the concept particularly evident: both institutions looked indistinguishable from churches. Both were in the Romanesque style, with elaborate porticos, knaves and richly patterned columns. Both had high ceilings. In London, one could stand in the centre of the main hall, gaze up fifty-two metres and find, in place of depictions of the Apostles or the Holy Family, 162 panels laying out the Earth\u2019s botanical wonders, from lemon trees to date palms, irises to rhododendrons, sunflowers to cotton plants.\n\nCeiling panels, Hintze Hall, Natural History Museum, London, 1881.\n\nThe first director of the Natural History Museum, Sir Richard Owen, put the mission squarely into view: the museum was to be, in his words, a \u2018cathedral\u2019 to science. Here, too, one might pursue consolation, inspiration and perspective. Here, too, one might shed sorrows and cast aside ingratitude and despondency. The soul of modern humanity, battered by industrialisation, was being offered a new kind of balm. Science wasn\u2019t dismissing our needs and cravings, our loneliness and fears. It was ready to help with a set of similarly structured, but just more rationally founded, answers.\n\nHintze Hall, Natural History Museum, London, 1881.\n\nThe move was tantalising and salutary. But, for all the beauty of these early \u2018cathedrals\u2019, it did not catch on. As more science museums opened, they looked less and less like churches and more and more like regular institutions of learning, the sort of places one might come to if one was considering a career in biology or educating a child. For its part, science got on with its day-to-day task of finding out about the workings of the universe, our planet and all its varied inhabitants. It neglected the business of building any sort of bridge between its discoveries and the spiritual cravings of humankind. As a consequence, the alienation and disenchantment of modern life continued. The more desolate voices complained that though science might have turned out to be \u2018true\u2019, its victory left us inwardly hungry and forlorn.\n\nThe despair is unjustified. Properly viewed, science has never been the enemy of spiritual enrichment. Indeed, when we know how to approach it and are encouraged to do so (whether by architecture or art, literature or film), science will yield ideas every bit as consoling and inspiring, and as applicable to our lives and as relevant to our pains as those found in religion. The revelations of science do not have to mean an end to the project of therapeutic psychology initiated by religion; they can refashion, enhance and amplify it. This may not be how scientists themselves go about their work or present it to the public, but the fruit of this work lends itself impeccably to a mission of ethical-psychological elaboration.\n\nWe can, in other words, look to science for the sort of ideas we used to seek in religion, and that could assuage some of the ills of modernity. At least seven big ideas can be found...",

      "content": "### 1 Perspective: the scale of the universe\n\nWe are at permanent risk of losing perspective, of making more of our troubles, hopes, fears and status than is warranted or good for us. One of our greatest terrors is to be made to \u2018feel small\u2019, to be reduced in our own eyes by the inconsiderate or thoughtless actions of others. This is to miss that the solution to our agitation does not lie in expanding our importance, but in learning to reduce it ever further. Peace of mind does not come from finding an indisputable way of enhancing our status; it comes from discovering a sufficiently elevated and distant angle from which to look at everything we are and do in order to understand that we are blessedly and thankfully irrelevant to everything.\n\nScience can help with this adjustment. Humanity used to believe that the Earth was at the centre of the universe, and that we, in turn, were at the centre of creation. Slowly and reluctantly, we came to accept that we might be only one planet among a few others and might be revolving around our sun rather than it around us.\n\nFrom there, the progress of science has rendered us ever less significant \u2014 with enormous theoretical benefit to our psyches and our egos. In 1672, the Italian astronomer Cassini made the first measurement of the distance between two planets \u2014 Earth and Mars \u2014 and found that the Solar System (still understood as equivalent to \u2018the universe\u2019) was an astonishing twenty times larger than the Greek philosophers had thought. Ninety-nine years later, J\u00e9rome Lelande accurately estimated the distance between the Earth and the Sun at ninety-three million miles. In 1838, humanity got an indication of the likely scale of the universe when the German astronomer Freidrich Bessel made the first ever correct measurement of the distance to a star: ten light years.\n\nThe Milky Way, high above the Church of the Good Shepherd, New Zealand.\n\nWe had for a long time imagined that the universe might be a relatively empty place. Around 700 CE, the Dunhuang star chart recorded 1,300 stars seen by Chinese astronomers with the naked eye; John Flamsteed\u2019s 1729 Atlas Coelestis mapped 3,000 stars. By 1903, German astronomers had pushed up the number to 324,000 stars.\n\nBut only by the 1960s did we become fully aware of the true scale of our puniness. We understood that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has approximately 100 billion stars in it, that there are ten billion galaxies in the observable universe, each of which contains an average of 100 billion stars, which means that there are around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (a billion trillion) stars at large.\n\nWhen we lose perspective, as we invariably do in the course of pretty much every day in the frenetic city, we don\u2019t need a philosophy lesson or a church service. We need to spend one or two quiet moments with a photograph from the Hubble Space telescope and a reminder that we are \u2014 in a glorious and redemptive way \u2014 what we always feared: nothing.\n\nA beautiful end: The planetary nebula Abell 33.",

      "content": "### 2 All is vanity: The Second Law of Thermodynamics\n\nMany of our efforts are designed to perpetuate ourselves in time. We strive to live on through our work and to make something more enduring than our biological selves. To release us from this exhausting and vainglorious folly, religions used to kindly remind us, in the words of Ecclesiastes 1:2, that all is vanity \u2014 and they would occasionally show us a skull or shattered tomb to bring the point home more forcefully.\n\nWith religion in abeyance, science offers us a more powerful expression of this Biblical concept: the Second Law of Thermodynamics. First worked out in the nineteenth century, this states that the tendency of all systems \u2014 of which the universe is one \u2014 will be to dissipate energy over time until it reaches a state of complete rest. Given a sufficient span, estimated as 10106 years, our universe and its superclusters of galaxies will all collapse and we will enter what scientists call a Dark Era, in which \u2014 after so much excitement, individual and cosmic \u2014 nothing will remain except for a quiet dilute gas of photons and leptons.\n\nThe situation is no better closer to home. The sun\u2019s centre burns, like a giant engine, at fifteen million degrees Celsius. But our Sun is four and a half billion years old and the average stable lifespan of a star is a mere eight billion years.\n\nAn added complication is that the Sun\u2019s brightness increases by ten per cent every billion years, gradually heating our planet. In one billion years, the Sun\u2019s increased brightness will have caused our oceans to evaporate and made all life impossible. In about four billion years, when it runs out of hydrogen, the Sun will become a \u2018red giant\u2019 star, possibly expanding as far as Mars, at which point it will absorb and destroy Earth. The Sun\u2019s outer layers will drift into space to form a planetary nebula. The remaining core will be a dense, stable \u2018white dwarf\u2019 that will continue to radiate heat for two or three billion years.\n\nTo repeat the point with NASA\u2019s help: all is vanity.",

      "content": "### 3 The resilience of life: five mass extinctions\n\nIt can be easy to fall into worry about whether we, and most of what matters to us, will endure. The kindest advice is not to imply that all is assured and that a cataclysm can be averted; it\u2019s to understand how common wholesale destruction has been on our planet and to be cheered by the thought that, nevertheless, life has endured, for it is ultimately a far more tenacious process than any cellular being in which it happens to subsist at a specific point. Individuals and species may die; life itself survives (at least until the Sun burns out).\n\nWe are standing on the petrified remains and fossilised bodies of thousands of species that came before us. By extension, many more will come after us. From a sufficient distance, we are not the end point and therefore should not cling so anxiously to what presently exists. We should learn to identify with the long-term direction of the river, and not grasp so tightly to our own fragile vessels bobbing unsteadily in the turbulent eddies of the present. There have been five mass extinctions afflicting multicellular life in the last 540 million years. Earth is a risky place and always has been. We\u2019re not living in especially tempestuous times; peace is just an illusory by-product of short-term thinking. 450 million years ago, the Ordovician mass extinction, caused by a mini-ice age, caused the planet to lose seventy per cent of all its species, including most trilobites, brachiopods, crinoids and graptolites. 375 million years ago, another seventy per cent of species were lost in the Devonian extinction. In the huge Permian extinction 252 million years ago, ninety-five per cent of marine and seventy per cent of terrestrial species vanished (among them the fin-backed reptiles called pelycosaurs and the vast mammal-like creatures known as moschops). But life went on \u2014 as it always does.\n\nGradually, cellular existence built itself up again and a semblance of serenity appeared to reign on Earth. But that was an illusion too: 201 million years ago came the Triassic extinction (triggered by the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea). In the process, gone were the brachiopods, the shelled cephalopods, and the phytosaurs. Lastly, and most famously, came the Cretaceous extinction, 65.5 million years ago, which did away with the dinosaurs, the flying pterosaurs, the mosasaurs, the plesiosaurs and the graceful ichthyosaurs.\n\nWe should not expect our particular life form to endure. We are writing in time in fading ink. We will eventually go, but life itself will stubbornly persevere: within a few hundred million years, a creature comparable to us, but perhaps a little kinder and a lot more intelligent, may replace us and will spend weekends looking at our remains with a mixture of pity and boredom in the display cabinets of a new generation of scientific cathedrals.",

Why do we worry so much what other people think? Why are we so prone to anxiety? Why do we eat so much? Why are we so interested in pornography?\n\nIt\u2019s equally tempting to search for explanations that emphasise our villainous natures and then to harshly condemn our lack of self-command. We end up disgusted with ourselves and intemperate and judgemental towards others.\n\nBut science \u2014 far more effectively than religion \u2014 may teach us the art of forgiveness, and liberate us from our urge to criticise. Of course, we\u2019re less than ideally adapted to the civilised and intellectually complex lives that we aspire to lead. Of course, we are largely demented, prey to powerful impulses, filled with dread and driven by lower appetites. We have had very little time to do or be anything else.\n\nWe are estimated to have appeared in more or less our current form in Africa 200,000 years ago. For most of this time, we lived in small groups, we foraged, we grunted, we didn\u2019t wait for others to stop talking, we fought constantly, we were terrified of everything and understood almost nothing, we didn\u2019t sit quietly in chairs for many hours, we didn\u2019t wear tight-fitting clothes, we couldn\u2019t read or write, we got very interested in any fertile human who came our way and we gorged ourselves whenever we found something sweet growing on a tree.\n\nThe time since the birth of Jesus comprises one per cent of our history; the last 250 years, the period since we became urbanised and began living with technology in scientific culture, encompasses a mere 0.1 per cent. Naturally, therefore, most of our impulses are askew and better suited to more basic conditions. It is a miracle we ever manage to be polite, to explain our feelings, to compromise and to see anything from another\u2019s point of view.\n\nIllustration from The Evolution of Man by Ernst Haeckel, 1879.\n\nFrom the vantage point of science, we\u2019re doing extremely well. So much of our capacity for calm depends on our sense of what people should be like \u2014 and how well they succeed in measuring up to expectations. Evolutionary history teaches us that humans should be a lot worse than they are. Humanity is rushing to catch up with its ideals and we can afford to be rather more gentle towards its constant but inevitable lapses. The wonder isn\u2019t, in the end, that we\u2019re so uncivilised but that we ever manage, now and then, to have a few moments of civilisation.",

      "content": "### 5 Beyond the ego: mind and body\n\nThe human animal is a proud creature. We puff ourselves up, we exaggerate our competence and integrity. We imagine ourselves making a difference. At the heart of our misplaced assurance is a particular concept of the self. We imagine the self as an integrated ego that can understand most of what it is, that is radically separate from the world beyond \u2014 and that may have an immaterial essence that will endure after the body has expired.\n\nScience flatly contradicts us on all such assumptions. The ego emerges from its analyses as something far closer to what Buddhism has long suggested: an artful illusion, a flickering, unsteady flame unaware of most of what it is, an entity thoroughly merged with and traversed by the world beyond it, an \u2018I\u2019 destined to dissolve after a brief span and to be reabsorbed by a cosmic totality from which it should never have imagined itself to be distinct. To listen to the neuroscientists, our impression of being a coherent \u2018I\u2019 is only a clever trick performed by a narrative capacity lodged somewhere within the cerebral cortex, and that weaves our scattered memories and intermittent sensations together into an ongoing sense of being someone in particular rather than just a rough assemblance of random impressions, pain and pleasure signals and conflicting wishes.\n\nOur conscious awareness comprises only a fraction, as little as five per cent, of our overall cognitive activity. Most of what we do in our brains is housed in faculties from which our day-to-day understanding has been barred \u2014 we both somewhere know and yet actively don\u2019t know how to make our hearts beat, grow fingernails, digest sugar, walk up the stairs and extract oxygen from the air. We don\u2019t have the keys to our own house.\n\nRather than one unitary brain, we are an assemblage of different brains that evolved in separate millennia, each with its own sets of priorities and agendas kept private from our pilot selves: the cerebellum wants one thing, the hippocampus another, the medulla a third. The sense of being \u2018a person\u2019 is a simplification designed to keep us steady, and whose invented nature we sometimes get a sense of as we fall asleep or when we are discombobulated by illness or start to be fragmented by age.\n\nAs evidence of how much otherness we bear within us, we need only consider that our gut is host to more than 10,000 alien microbial species, single-celled eukaryotes as well as helminth parasites and viruses, that entered our bodies in the early years of life (as we licked the carpet or kissed our parents) and that now help us to digest dietary fibre or synthesise vitamins B and K. We tend to keep quiet, as we introduce ourselves to someone else with the use of a single name, about the symbiotic relationship we are currently conducting with trillions of wholly foreign bacterial cells pullulating within us a few millimetres from our waistband.\n\nAs for our sense of being continuous, this too has little basis in our biology. We may think of ourselves as a unitary person who survives through time, but pieces of us are constantly dying and being remade. Thirty thousand cells are lost every minute; the average cell is seven years old. Our external surface layer is replaced once a year; every decade, our whole skeleton is remade; every two years, our liver is fashioned anew. We\u2019re not so much a person as an instruction manual for a person who keeps dissolving and having to be laboriously reassembled.\n\nAt our deaths, the fictional nature of our egos can no longer be denied, and our sixty trillion cells become a feast for maggots, bacteria and fungi. A part of us will end up in the stomach of a beetle. A slug will feast on a part of our liver. A bit of us will provide nutrients for a hawk. The carbon in our bones will end up inside the trunk of a conifer tree. Some of us will come down as rain. We were never really an \u2018I\u2019; we just borrowed some bits of the universe for a few moments and will go on to be many other things, just as valuable, in time. Like every living thing, we were made from tiny shards of stars; we have travelled through supernovas. We\u2019re as old as the universe; \u2018I\u2019 was just a passing phase. What was lent to us by the Earth will animate new life in time. None of this should panic us. Scientific reality may inspire a far more consoling philosophy than any book of prayer. We don\u2019t need to clasp so tightly onto life. We are never quite whole and will soon enough be in pieces again.\n\nThere is no use expecting to be remembered by the name our parents thoughtfully gave to a small assemblage of cells \u2014 all now long dead \u2014 many years ago. The woodlice and the pigeons will be grateful. We are not strangers to death: atom by atom, we\u2019ve been falling apart and being remade for over thirteen billion years.",

Our touching humanity is nowhere more evident than when we consider, through the perspective of science, the unreliability of our senses. We may think we know what is happening in the world, and for centuries we were very sure indeed of our verdicts, but modern science has served to reveal the scale of our ignorance.\n\nWe might be inclined blithely to trust our eyes \u2014 but how little of what exists is natively captured by them. Only a narrow band of electromagnetic waves ever registers on our retinas. We miss infrared light at one end of the spectrum and X-ray light at another. For most of history, we couldn\u2019t guess what a fearsome and noble creature a flea might be, until in 1665, the scientist Robert Hooke showed us one from under his microscope at 200 times its real size.\n\nRobert Hooke, A Flea, from Micrographia, 1665.\n\nWe miss that one dip of a hand net might contain ten million viruses, a million bacteria and a thousand small protozoans and algae \u2014 among these the cyanobacteria prochlorococcus, 0.6 micrometres long, collectively responsible (there are three octillion of them on the planet) for releasing twenty per cent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. On a clear day, we can see objects five kilometres away at best. This is why it has been conceptually so hard for us to grasp that Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, is 39,900,000,000,000 kilometres from us, just as it has been hard for us to imagine that there could be forty-three quintillion atoms in a grain of sand, each like a miniature planetary system, with electrons orbiting a nucleus of protons and neutrons, inside of which dwell smaller hadrons, inside of which reside even smaller quarks.\n\nOne dip of a hand net (magnified) showing tiny crustaceans, larvae, plankton, worms, fish eggs and brown-gold coils of cyanobacteria. David Liittschwager, Marine Microfauna, 2006.\n\nWe trust our ears and fail to realise that there is no such thing as silence, just the limitations of what we can hear. We only register sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz and so miss all that is above (infrasound) and below (ultrasound). We cannot detect the sounds of the Sumatran rhinoceros (3Hz) or of air passing over the tops of mountains. We miss the noise emitted by lightning above us and by the harmonic tremor of pressurised magma deep in the earth below us.\n\nLikewise, our understanding of time, anchored as it is within units of twenty-four-hour days and the year it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun, starts to collapse when asked to comprehend that it might have taken 250,000 generations \u2014 or a quarter of a million years \u2014 of genetic mutation for vertebrates to generate their eyes or that it has been a mere eighty-four generations since Julius Caesar walked the Earth 2,000 years ago.\n\nOnly five per cent of what we call the observable universe is ever captured by our senses. We depend on clever theories for the other ninety-five per cent. We are out of touch with, and perplexed by, pretty much everything occurring around us. We should go easy on ourselves.",

But science is capable of nurturing feelings of gratitude because of a basic truth about the way gratitude works: it arises out of a sense of contrast, from an awareness of how much more awful things might have been, of how dreadful things can get \u2014 and of how lucky, all things considered, we have turned out to be.\n\nThere are a million things that we have missed out on and areas of pain that continue to scar us, but science bids us to look up and remember some of the larger reasons we possess to be thankful.\n\nWhen our psyches allow us a moment of respite, we can be grateful for all the seemingly random circumstances in place for us to even exist...\n\n\u2022 That 13.8 billion years ago, something smaller than an electron chose to swell within a fraction of a second like an expanding balloon into a zone permeated with energy ninety-three billion light years in size that we now clumsily call the universe.\n\n\u2022 That some of the energy from this swift expansion was able to coagulate into particles, which grouped together to form the light atoms of hydrogen, lithium and helium \u2014 which then assembled into galaxies, which gave birth to stars, inside whose molten burning cores all the elements necessary for the nucleic acids essential to life \u2014 carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus \u2014 were forged.\n\n\u2022 That gravity drew the stars together to form galaxies (a hundred billion of them), including \u2014 fortuitously \u2014 the Milky Way, a small corner of the universe containing just 400 billion stars, in which our sun was born out of a giant, spinning cloud of dust and gas four and a half billion years ago.\n\n\u2022 That around the same time, swarms of debris collided to form our Earth \u2014 a lava-washed, uninhabitable rock, that gravity happened to throw into orbit as the third planet from the Sun \u2014 the exact right distance away (0.38 to 10.0 astronomical units) for life to develop.\n\n\u2022 That another planet, Theia, collided with Earth, gifting us our Moon, which slowed the Earth\u2019s rotation, stabilised atmospheric conditions and created the twenty-four-hour day and caused the Earth to tilt, forming the seasons, without which we would have permanent regional extremes of heat and cold, drought and floods.\n\n\u2022 That ice particles left over from the collisions of hundreds of comets melted, water vapour condensed and then oceans were formed.\n\n\u2022 That comet collisions delivered another chance cosmic gift, the essential components of life and DNA like ribose, carbon dioxide, ethanol, amino acids and phosphorus.\n\n\u2022 That underwater hot springs released the right amount of energy and just the right mix of chemicals to allow the first single-cell organisms, prokaryotes, to form four billion years ago.\n\n\u2022 That Earth\u2019s toxic atmosphere of methane and carbon dioxide slowly became sweetened by the release of oxygen from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) \u2014 the first creatures to photosynthesise \u2014 and gradually oxygenated eighty-five per cent of the atmosphere.\n\n\u2022 That 2.7 billion years ago, a random, chance event known as \u2018the fateful encounter\u2019 meant that two single cells merged, and procreated and then after about a billion more years, developed sexes.\n\n\u2022 That 500 million years ago, plants spread from the oceans to the land before animals did and slowly developed into more complex vascular plants, whose seeds could be dispersed by wind, creating grasslands and forests in which different species could evolve.\n\n\u2022 That 245 million years ago, a rise in oxygen levels led to the Cambrian explosion, which saw the greatest diversification of life in Earth\u2019s history, starting with ocean-dwelling hard-shelled invertebrates, leading to new fish species, the first land-based insects and large vertebrate ocean animals that developed four limbs and went ashore to lay eggs \u2014 which hatched and evolved into amphibians, reptiles and mammals.\n\n\u2022 That an asteroid fifteen kilometres wide just happened to hit Earth 65.5 million years ago and destroyed most terrestrial organisms including all non-avian dinosaurs, but also created ideal conditions in which furry mammals, our close ancestors, were able to thrive with less competition and evolved into primates.\n\n\u2022 That the Earth remained stable enough for long enough that the first apes could appear in Africa, twenty-five million years ago, the first hominids seven million years ago and our frightened, brilliant Homo sapiens a mere 200,000 years ago.\n\n\u2022 That your genes managed to pass safely through an unbroken 10,000-generation chain, despite the very best efforts of cyclones, predators and a constant barrage of viruses.\n\n\u2022 That an average, fertile woman will have 100,000 eggs, and a man will produce a trillion sperm, each of these very different, but that \u2014 nevertheless \u2014 you have managed to emerge from the options as you are.\n\n\u2022 That there are days of balmy sunshine and lemons, that there are olives, figs and hazelnuts.\n\n\u2022 That this moment exists within a 13.799\u00b10.021 billion-year span of cosmic time.\n\n\u2022 And to all this, as they used to in the churches, one might cry (or whisper): Hallelujah!\n\n\u2018Mystic Mountain\u2019, taken from the Hubble telescope, NASA, 2010.\n\nThere is enough in science to give birth to twenty religions \u2014 so much to worship, to be awed by and to be consoled through. How poor the old religions were by comparison, how paltry an invention a god is next to the mysterium tremendum of dark matter, string theory or quantum wave functions. The curse of modernity is not to have invented science; it\u2019s not yet to have understood all that one might do with it.",

      "content": "## 18 Nature\n\nThe modern age has manhandled nature like none before it. Previous eras may not have treated it with too much respect \u2014 the ancient Greeks stripped most of their coastline of trees by late Antiquity, and the Romans deforested large chunks of North Africa and killed off all its larger wildlife for food and gladiatorial fights (the Roman historian Pliny lamented how the nobility had destroyed Africa\u2019s elephants to feed their appetite for ivory bedsteads) \u2014 but the old world lacked the new one\u2019s sheer relentlessness, as well as its power saws, dynamite, pesticides, guns and processing plants. As the railways cut through the American continent, nature was hacked down with unsurpassed thoroughness. There had been twenty-five million bison in North America in the sixteenth century; there were fewer than a hundred by the nineteenth century. There had once been a billion trees across the continent; by 1900, eighty-five per cent were gone.\n\nBison skulls await industrial processing, Michigan Carbon Works, Detroit, 1892.\n\nAcross modernising countries, people knew something important was being lost and many urgent attempts were made to slow the extinctions. The Yosemite Valley was protected by Abraham Lincoln in 1864; Congress established Yellowstone National Park in 1872; President Wilson created the National Park Service in 1916. In England, the Lake District was protected by legal force in the late nineteenth century; in Australia, the Royal National Park was established in 1879; Switzerland created the first European National Park in 1914. On a smaller scale, modern cities created free parks for their inhabitants: Munich\u2019s Englischer Garten was founded in 1789, London\u2019s Victoria Park in 1845, Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park in 1865, and New York\u2019s Central Park in 1876.\n\nChilde Hassam, Central Park, 1892.\n\nWhen trying to justify why nature might be so important, there was always one answer put forward by promoters of national and urban parks: industrial society, with its factories, crowded streets and tightly packed tenement blocks, made it imperative for people to have a chance to get out into nature for fresh air and exercise. Trees and habitats had to be preserved so that we could keep fit. Though self-evident, something else \u2014 less often mentioned and harder to put a finger on \u2014 was also at stake: the idea that nature might be necessary for what a few voices still dared to call our \u2018souls\u2019, and others more plainly our psyches. It seemed that nature was as important for treating the psychological ills bred by modernity as it was for addressing its physical ones. Modernity had made us mentally unwell \u2014 and nature held some of the cures. What, then, might the therapeutic benefits be? At least five themes suggested themselves.",

      "content": "### 1 Recalibration\n\nAs European pioneers began cutting and shooting their way across the American continent in the early nineteenth century, one unlikely figure, a minor French-American businessman called John Audubon, followed in their wake. He was not after land, gold or bison hides. He was interested in birds, with which he had been fascinated since his childhood in Brittany, and he announced his intention to draw every species in America. In the end, he managed only 435 (there were 2,000 in total), which he etched on large copper engraved plates and collected together in one of the most successful books of the nineteenth century, The Birds of America, published between 1827 and 1838 (Queen Victoria had a copy, as did France\u2019s Charles X and American President James Polk).\n\nJohn Audubon, Mallard Duck, Plate 221 of Birds of America, 1834.\n\nMany of Audubon\u2019s birds were rare and unlikely ever to be seen in the wild by his audience. But one of his most popular illustrations was of one of the most common of all birds: the mallard duck. Mallards, with their bottle-green heads and white collars, are an immediately recognisable sight to almost anyone who has ever sat on a bench in an urban park in Europe or North America. Despite their ubiquity, it can be highly therapeutic to encounter one. Part of what makes them such a welcome sight is how entirely indifferent they are towards all of what and who we are. They\u2019ll paddle around beside us, looking out for dragonflies or worms, without fear or favour.\n\nEverything that we may think of as important, everything that agitates and stirs us, makes us feel shame or evokes longing, is of no concern whatsoever to a mallard. We may be an important person in society or one of the most insignificant or maligned; that is of no matter to the duck, who will as willingly take a bit of stale bread off the hand of a senior judge as off a convicted felon. The mallards care nothing for our turbulent histories, the dramas in our governments, the reversals in our economies, the shocks in the lives of our famous actors. Things have been progressing in pretty much the same way for centuries for them; the loss of the American colonies or Napoleon\u2019s rout at Waterloo were not of any concern and nor are whatever emotions happen to be roiling and tormenting us today.\n\nIt could appear lonely to encounter such aloofness, but it is in fact the greatest relief from the agony of life in the human beehive, where everything that we say or do, all the gossip about us, our striving for reputation and our wounded pride, consume so much of our nervous energy and stir us in our uneasy nights. By enmeshing ourselves tightly with other humans, we not only cut ourselves off from fresh air, we deny ourselves the experience of \u2018otherness\u2019, of creatures who can put our own melodramas into perspective via their haughty disregard for our existence \u2014 and their laser-like focus on their own, utterly contrasting priorities.\n\nWalking down a modern urban thoroughfare, the throb and dynamism of our benighted race is constantly on show. Our thoughts are drawn to what we have not yet achieved and what we still so badly want. The adverts implore us to shift our desires, the news enrages and perturbs us, information about our colleagues and acquaintances inflames our competitiveness. At this point, the mallard duck is not just another halfway interesting creature to spot while taking a pause on a walk. It\u2019s a pillar of truth waiting for us in one of the ponds in Victoria Park or Lincoln Park, the Englischer Garten or Central Park, waiting to tell us something that almost nothing and no one else will in the large city: that not a thing about us, good or bad, regrettable or beautiful, is of any interest to anyone outside our own vainglorious bubble. In short, and very thankfully, they tell us that we don\u2019t matter \u2014 and this is one of the most generous, kind and necessary messages that anyone in modernity could ever hear.\n\nA ten-minute walk from the Lustgarten to the relief of a mallard: Paul Hoeniger, Spittelmarkt, 1912.",

We can divert rivers, transform fortunes, invent miraculous machinery or start new lives on other continents.\n\nBut imagine for a moment a tree in autumn, a large tree, an oak or an aspen. It might be late October in a mild year. For a long time, the leaves held out, but now they are properly turning, a tell-tale silvery grey or ochre tinged with auburn. Within a few weeks and one or two vicious storms from the east, they will be gone, 200,000 of them blown around the forest floor, where millipedes, maggots, slime moulds, earthworms and bacteria are waiting to decompose them into primal mulch. Nothing can stop the melancholy process. All summer, the leaves protected us, filtering the harshness of the bright sunlight and casting gentle crisscross patterns as dusk fell. In spring, the leaves\u2019 appearance was a symbol of hope and new beginnings. Now the air smells of death and decay. Our lives are no less subject to the laws of nature than are trees. We, too, are born, develop and must die. There are autumns in our years that nothing can protect us from.\n\nBut by contemplating the ineluctable processes of growth and decay in nature, we may come to accept more serenely all that we will have to give up and see taken from us with time. There are laws of nature that we can\u2019t resist, that no amount of machinery or eloquence or money or power will overcome. An emperor and a tycoon are as vulnerable as a tramp before the mechanisms of the natural world, who will grind each one of us back down to our cellular origins. It could sound merely tragic, but there is relief from the manic assertiveness of our egos to be found in the grand spectacles of nature. The majestic trees render what might have been a mere humiliation into a call for a noble surrender before an awe-inspiring adversary.\n\nIn 1853, the American painter George Inness received a letter from the president of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company, who was proud of a new line that he and his team had cut through pristine nature to connect up Buffalo with New Jersey. He asked Inness to emphasise the sweep of the railway track and the scale of the roundhouse. But Inness wasn\u2019t so sure of these priorities. He was very fond of trees \u2014 their stature and their elegance, but most importantly, their philosophical wisdom. Which is why, when he came to paint The Lackawanna Valley (1855), he included so many incongruous tree stumps in the foreground of his picture. A civilisation that was more excited about the arrival of a train than the end of nature had forgotten its priorities. It was also a civilisation steered by people at risk of forgetting that they too were still subject to natural laws, that even if they could now reach town in a few hours to buy a hat or transport a wagon of coal, they could not escape the limitations imposed on all living things. It was no surprise that those trees had been so impatiently cut down. They had been speaking too loudly to some rather vain railway men of the vanity of all things.\n\nGeorge Inness, The Lackawanna Valley, c. 1856.",

He rented a room in a modest farmhouse where, far from the crowded cities and turbulent urban passions that he feared, he wrote some of his most famous works, including The Gay Science, Thus Spake Zarathustra and Twilight of the Idols.\n\nHe would get up very early and write until early afternoon, at which point he would go out for a two- to three-hour walk \u2014 which was where he grew familiar with the grey-brown mountain cattle known as the Braunvieh. Groups of them were to be found in most pastures, and Nietzsche fell in love with them.\n\nHe was fascinated by the patient, wise-looking way they dealt with their often less-than-ideal lives. They showed no impatience or anger. They didn\u2019t appear to suffer from envy or regret missed opportunities. They seemed to harbour no plans for revenge or cower fearfully from the future. They behaved calmly in rain and sunshine, when flies landed on their noses and their heavy bells chafed their necks.\n\nNietzsche felt that they had reached the state of calm and equanimity that had been the goal of all philosophy for the ancient Stoics, a frame of mind known to the Greeks as \u2018ataraxia\u2019. They might not have read much Zeno or Seneca, but they were true philosophers. Nietzsche gave the Braunvieh a starring role in his own philosophy in Thus Spake Zarathustra: \u2018Unless we change (or be converted) and become as cows,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018we shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.\u2019\n\nPaul Gauguin, Kneeling Cow, 1888.",

Nothing about our lives may feel as exciting and as special as it should; we still lack so much.\n\nWe didn\u2019t start like this. Once we were three years old and everything was amazing: the light switch, the zip on our jacket, the way a door closed. Since then, our enthusiasm has dropped, but encouragements not to lose a taste for existence abound in the spectacle of nature. Granted, we have not been invited to certain parties, and our job is feeling repetitive \u2014 but right now, across parts of Asia and Australia, colonies of weaver ants are building their nests, some of the oddest and most impressive structures that exist. Implausible numbers of these ants, into the many hundreds, will stand with military precision on the edge of a large leaf, and collaborate with others to draw a neighbouring leaf to it with the help of strands of larval silk. They will then harmoniously and diligently sew the two leaves together with their silk thread, building up sealed and watertight structures the size of a human head or larger, in which they set up their meticulously ordered colonies.\n\nWeaver ants working together to build their nest, Phillipines, 2018.\n\nWe can get bored because we are in a tunnel that we mistake for an open view. We can feel as though we have explored everything we need to know. But we have only to recall that things are far weirder and more stupefying than we in the city ever tend to think \u2014 because we are sharing the planet not only with people we went to school with and high-powered television executives but also flying squirrels, hyacinth macaws, vampire crabs, glasswinged butterflies, French angelfish, okapis, nicobar pigeons, rock agamas and tokay geckos \u2014 all of which contribute to a gigantic call for us to take a closer, more wondrous and more enchanted look at what breathes around us.",

By the 1890s, in the suburbs of both London and Paris, it was estimated that three-quarters of householders were actively engaged in tending to their gardens. The most popular flowers were lilies, daisies, lilacs, tulips and daffodils. Talk of growing flowers is apt to seem ridiculous to most people under thirty.\n\nThere are surely more exciting and substantial goals to set our eyes on than the gestation of small colourful temporary bulbs \u2014 when, for example, we have romantic love to explore or professional life to succeed at.\n\nBut it is almost impossible to find anyone over seventy who does not care for gardening. By then, most people\u2019s ambitions will have taken a substantial hit: love or work will not have worked out in key ways. At this point, the consolation offered by gardening starts to feel very significant. Flowers become something to be cherished precisely because of their lack of exigencies or overt grandeur. The world beyond will always resist our efforts to bend it to our will, but in the garden, with some effort, regular watering and some luck with the sun, we can for brief weeks be the midwives to something as visually seductive as it is cheering. We are moved by the flowers\u2019 tender beauty because we know, by this stage, so much about pain and disappointment; we aren\u2019t sentimental so much as traumatised. We won\u2019t turn down this one of nature\u2019s gifts. It isn\u2019t the largest, but it may \u2014 on a mild summer evening \u2014 be very much good enough.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Garden at Arles, 1888.\n\nThose who wished to protect nature from modernity\u2019s destructiveness have often made powerful appeals to people\u2019s altruism; they have evoked the suffering of other species and the needs of as yet unborn generations. But it is rarely a winning strategy to try to get through to the selfish by appeals to their conscience; it may simply be wiser to target their self-interest.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to make impassioned speeches begging the drillers and the loggers to be good. We need only point out the cost to themselves, and more specifically to their mental well-being. There may be other ways to get healthy besides going to the park, but it is hard to imagine a species maintaining even a semblance of mental equilibrium without, somewhere in the picture, some very mighty trees, a mallard duck, or a team of weaver ants.",

There was only one candidate we could marry and our parents picked them out. There was one set of people in the vicinity and they could not be avoided. There was no chance to live anywhere else; there was little one could afford to buy; there was no news from anywhere and nothing much to envy or long for. No figures of authority could ever be questioned: one had to follow whatever was dictated by families, preachers, teachers, kings and queens and, of course, God, who knew everything and had very precise plans for how one should conduct oneself, from birth till death, pretty much every day. There was no point even wondering if we were happy; nothing could change even if we weren\u2019t. One existed between a set of very firm and very prescriptive walls.\n\nModernity has blasted open our confines and rendered us \u2018free\u2019 at every level. We can choose whatever job we like, marry whomever we please, divorce at any time, live anywhere, question anything, obey no one. It sounds pleasant and in some ways it is, but it is also a heavy, sometimes intolerable, burden.\n\nFor long periods, we may manage to shield ourselves from the full realisation of the freedoms we possess. We continue into adulthood with some of the mentality we adopted in our early years; we are meek children pretending to be grown-ups. We place our trust in teacher and parent substitutes (bosses, governments).\n\nWe tell ourselves that various irksome aspects of our lives belong to \u2018duty\u2019 (like a version of homework). We dismiss thoughts of change by imagining that our friends and acquaintances would be shocked and deeply invested in our current arrangements.\n\nAll the while, we picture that people in authority must know \u2014 they look so respectable and so knowledgeable \u2014 and therefore we follow them even if we don\u2019t quite understand the reasons for their dictates. What is just has to be.\n\nThen come the crises that, as much as they manifest themselves in individual lives, are fundamental to our whole era: moments of radical uncertainty when we cannot any more explain why we are doing this rather than that, married to this person rather than someone else, doing this particular job rather than any other, living here rather than elsewhere. We realise two things above all: that no one cares and no one knows. No one cares who we are with and what we are up to; they may have some prejudices and points of view but they are too taken up with their own struggles to bother with how we are living. Their assumptions about who we are, which we once thought of as impregnable and essential to fit in with, are revealed as paper-thin and flexible. We could call them up today and rewrite our entire biographies in their minds and they would, after a moment of surprise, shrug their shoulders and move on.\n\nIt seems as though our organisation would miss us if we decided to quit, but within a week, they\u2019d hardly remember us. We are not indispensable anywhere. We might become an artist, a politician, a gardener or a recluse in a small house in a barren part of Andalucia. We don\u2019t have to be anywhere; that is the old-school way of thinking. Term has ended now and we don\u2019t have to come back, ever\u2026. As for authority, no one seems to know: the government doesn\u2019t, the old teachers certainly don\u2019t and all the people we once looked up to appear to have little clue.\n\nSolitude in Andalucia.\n\nAll the while, just to make our thoughts even more intense and agitated, we know that time is running out: that others have achieved so much more by our age, that we\u2019re going to be old and then dead very soon. We suffer from a vertigo of choice. We may long for the former prison walls. We long to be told what we have to do by a voice in the sky. It feels as though we are going out of our minds, but we are just typical anxious citizens of modernity.\n\nWe don\u2019t generally talk about such crises. They feel shameful. But they are an endemic part of what it means to live in modern times. If we are even slightly conscious, how could we not at regular intervals rattle everything that we are and have done? How could we not be panicked at the opportunities we have wasted, the questions we haven\u2019t thought of asking, the energies we haven\u2019t known how to harvest?\n\nWe are dying and the best part of us threatens to be buried without us ever having had the courage to explore ourselves \u2014 because we are shielding ourselves from the infinite options of adulthood, trying to remain a child and blaming other people and outward circumstances for our inactivity and fear.\n\nWe should be allowed to admit that we usually do not have enough strength of character to master our options. Only a few hundred people ever do in any generation. We will, in relation to our potential, have largely \u2018ruined our lives\u2019. We won\u2019t have known how to make the most of our freedoms. We will have longed for too many decades to please the teachers and our parents. At least we can admit to the problem. It\u2019s normal \u2014 and in its way, viewed with genuine kindness, almost funny. We should hold out our arms to our fellow, tortured citizens of modernity. This isn\u2019t just our fuck-up, it\u2019s the human condition: to be able to choose but to choose wrongly; to be able to move, but to be too scared to budge; to know the big assumptions are false but not to have courage or mental will to come up with alternatives; to understand that most people around us are fools we don\u2019t even like but to stay absurdly worried about what they think of us nevertheless.\n\nNone of this is strange; it belongs to the agonies of modernity \u2014 which deserve to be charted, laughed over and railed against, even when they cannot be overcome.\n\nCaspar David Friedrich, The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, 1818.",

      "content": "### 2 The agonies of happiness\n\nThe official religion of modernity is happiness. It sounds pleasant, but being asked to smile is a coercive requirement. There is a freedom that our age seems subtly yet horribly keen to deny us: the freedom to be miserable.\n\nThe child psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott also developed a suspicion of the sort of people who, whenever they see a baby, try to make it smile. They make funny faces, try peekaboo, jiggle it up and down, tickle its toes \u2014 and won\u2019t stop until baby finally lets out some laughs. This kind of jolly person is different from a happy person; a happy person smiles because they feel like it; a jollying person smiles because they are compelled to, because there is all sorts of unprocessed grief inside them from which they are manically in flight. If they stopped laughing for a moment, they might have to confront everything regrettable that they have not until now been able to face; all the emotions they haven\u2019t dared to accept in themselves \u2014 the anger against someone who let them down, the rage against something or someone they were supposed to love, the guilt about the error they so regret.\n\nMary Cassatt, Women Admiring a Child, 1897.\n\nIt is unnatural for anyone to remain untroubled and unsad for longer than fifteen minutes. There is always something sombre on the horizon. That is why the notion of being not just occasionally very happy but fundamentally and long-term jolly is such a perturbing possibility, built upon a denial of reality. Even babies have lots to feel sad about. They\u2019ve just left the womb, the most comfortable and intuitively nourishing place on earth, they\u2019re having to discover all the disappointments of trying to feed and keep one\u2019s body comfortable. They have so much to learn. They may even be getting the first intimations of mortality. Why would such a complicated creature ever feel like doing more than let out a very occasional giggle?\n\nUnfortunately, modern society is like a giant jollying person. It wants to pick us up and play peekaboo with us constantly. Television, advertising, parties, friends, the media \u2014 all conspire to suggest that doing great and feeling well-adjusted, optimistic and breezy might in some ways be normal.\n\nWe should be allowed to recognise that life is a hospice, not a hospital, that we are doomed and ailing; that anxiety follows us at every turn, that we are immensely fragile and always on the cusp of some disappointing new realisation. We should never have to tell anyone that we are \u2018doing well\u2019. The automatic assumption should be that of course we are in some kind of crisis: financial, romantic, reputational, existential \u2014 because that is what we humans are like. We should stamp out the suggestion from billboards that we could ever be something lighter and sunnier. Even on holiday, we will, naturally, be miserable; even when we\u2019ve done \u2018well\u2019 in aspects of our lives, we\u2019ll be at our wits\u2019 end most of the time. Of course we hate ourselves and wish we\u2019d done most things differently.\n\nWe need a society ready to meet us on our own terms \u2014 not one that is trying to get us to laugh sentimentally. We know in our hearts, and at 4 a.m. when we wake up in a panic, what life is really like \u2014 the despairing, anxious, always unsettled, always fretful and always questioning business it is. The next stage of our evolution will be to take what we know of ourselves and build a society around it, a society that has the courage to accept its true psychological complexity.\n\nFrank Toll, Despair, 1881.",

      "content": "### 3 The agonies of technology\n\nWe used to believe that life would always go on more or less as it is. It might have been grim, but it had always been thus and would be so forever.\n\nHowever, to be modern is to know that \u2014 with time and a bit of luck \u2014 things will improve. And they will do so because of science, because clever people are eventually going to unpick all the problems that we can\u2019t as yet master. That\u2019s what a backwards glance at history from our vantage point proves. With time, they sorted out tooth disease; they worked out how to fly; they learnt how to conquer distance. So we know \u2014 without a doubt \u2014 that other problems will be solved. With time, we\u2019ll learn how to live on different planets, grow a full head of hair, cure cancer, explain consciousness and figure out how to make energy at next to no cost. If we are in a fanciful speculative mood, we can go further: there will be a machine that will tell us who we should marry and how to read other people\u2019s thoughts. There\u2019ll be a way to determine what we are capable of and therefore how we should direct our careers. There\u2019ll be a way to download all the world\u2019s knowledge in minutes via a cable at the nape of the neck. And we\u2019ll never have to die.\n\nBack at the dawn of modernity, science fiction writers knew this way of projecting into the future. They pictured a world with submarines, mobile phones, space flight, prosperity and television. They were particularly interested in flying cars.\n\nAlbert Robida, Coming out of the Opera in the Year 2000, 1902.\n\nWe might chuckle at some of their ambitions, but to dream of future solutions is a natural state of mind in modernity \u2014 and not so foolish, either. Most of our technological dreams will come true. The question (and it\u2019s a very big and very painful question) is when.\n\nWe may be advancing towards a better future, but we also have to recognise that we ourselves are stuck in what can generously be called a transitional period: the old cyclical world has been abandoned; the future is not yet here.\n\nIn the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence is one of the most poignantly honest maps ever made. The Salviati planisphere was drawn around 1525 by a civil servant in Seville. He had a good grasp of Europe, Africa and the Middle East, but by the time he reached America, his knowledge was patchy in the extreme. He knew the rough outlines, but he didn\u2019t know the topographical features or the names. He was stuck in a transitional phase of map-making. One day it would be figured out: one day someone would reach the Pacific coast and send back precise information on the elevations of the Baja peninsula; one day a satellite would orbit the planet and send in microscopically precise information on every last square centimetre of the town of La Rinconada in the Peruvian Andes. But for now, in 1525, there was no option but to dwell in tantalising semi-ignorance.\n\nThe Salviati world map, 1525.\n\nIn so many areas of knowledge, we are like the Salviati map-maker. Our understanding of the human brain is eerily akin to our grasp of the world in 1525. There are countries and coastlines that we have explored fairly well, zones of the occipital lobe and the postcentral gyrus that match our understanding of the Bavaria Alps or the Loire in the early sixteenth century \u2014 but other areas are as remote to us as Alaska and Chile once used to be.\n\nWhen it comes to neuroscience, we are at the canoe-building stage. We haven\u2019t yet sent our first proper seaworthy vessel into the oceans. We can have fun daydreaming like Jules Verne, but none of our most exciting projections spare us the deeper, more painful insight: if we are reading this today, it will all come too late for us. There will eventually be fully completed maps of the mind. There will be ways of manipulating our neurology and optimising our intelligence; we will figure out why love is so difficult and how we should lead our lives; we\u2019ll discover how to reverse cell damage and the best way to prevent the aging process. We\u2019ll learn how not to have to die.\n\nBut it will be too late for us. We\u2019ll be long gone. We\u2019ll be like the unfortunates who died of measles before the vaccine was ready, who had a fatal crash before airbags, who had to do sums before calculators, and who got shipwrecked on the Cape of Good Hope before Airbus. Others will feel as sorry for us as we feel for those medieval paupers who died in agony of a disease that could now be vanquished with a pill worth $1 from the supermarket. Our present suffering will in time come to seem utterly avoidable \u2014 and in its way pitiful.\n\nWhat modernity denies us is the comfort of knowing that what we\u2019re suffering through is \u2018necessary\u2019. It isn\u2019t; our species just hasn\u2019t had enough time to figure it out yet. It is as necessary as toothache once was: that is, not very. We just haven\u2019t done the sums and run the experiments yet. We can see what is coming but we also know \u2014 with sad certainty \u2014 that we won\u2019t be around to enjoy it. We won\u2019t be there for the plug-in education tools and the career guidance implants. We\u2019ll miss out on the hair regrowth creams and the pills for eternal life. We\u2019re in our own Middle Ages in multiple areas, except that, unlike those in agony in the thirteenth century who saw themselves as enduring a Biblical curse, we know we\u2019re in a transitional period while we wait for the laboratories to build their prototypes. The particular agony of modernity is to see the shape of a better future, to understand that our pain isn\u2019t essential, to spy the rescue ship on the horizon \u2014 and yet to know that we will be dead by the time help arrives.",

There is constant pressure to accumulate more capital \u2014 but there is a grander project to hand that is unquestionably closer to what is most noble and fundamental about us: the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIt is knowledge that powered the project of modernity, and there is so much further for us to go. The list of what we still need to know is long: why the universe was ordered at the start and what began its entropy, how photons and dark energy operate, how life began (and therefore the chemical process required to ignite it), the causes of the explosion and diversification of multicellular animals at the beginning of the Cambrian era, how animals\u2019 homing instinct operates, how solar energy can be harnessed \u2014 and, not least, how the human brain works.\n\nWe are, in many ways, a revolting species.

      "content": "#### I. Introduction\n\nYou have just started to read a book that claims, at least, to tell you how to be alone.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt is extremely easy to be alone; you do not need a book. Here are some suggestions:\n\nGo into the bathroom; lock the door, take a shower. You are alone.\n\nGet in your car and drive somewhere (or walk, jog, bicycle, even swim).You are alone.\n\nWake yourself in the middle of the night (you are of course completely and absolutely alone while you are asleep, even if you share your bed with someone else, but you are almost certainly not\n  conscious of it, so let\u2019s ignore that one for the moment); don\u2019t turn your lights on; just sit in the dark. You are alone.\n\nNow push it a bit. Think about doing something that you normally do in company \u2013 go to the cinema or a restaurant, take a walk in the country or even a holiday abroad \u2013 by yourself.\n  Plan it out; the logistics are not difficult. You know how to do these things. You would be alone.\n\nSo what is the problem? Why are you reading this book?\n\nAnd of course I do not know the answer. Not in your case, at least. But I can imagine some possible motives:\n\nFor some reason, good or bad, of which bereavement is perhaps the bitterest, your normal circle of not-aloneness has been broken up; you have to tackle unexpected isolation, you doubt your\n  resources and are courageously trying to explore possible options. You will be a member of a fast-growing group \u2013 single-occupancy households in the UK have increased from 12 per cent of all\n  households in 1961 to nearly 30 per cent in 2011.\n\nSomeone you thought you knew well has opted for more solitude \u2013 they have gone off alone to do something that excludes you, temporarily or for a longer period; you cannot really feel\n  jealous, because it excludes everyone else too; you are a little worried about them; you cannot comprehend why they would do anything so weird or how they will manage. You want to understand.\n\nYou want to get something done \u2013 something that feels important to you. It is quite likely, in this case, that it is something creative. But you find it difficult to concentrate; constant\n  interruptions, the demands of others, your own busy-ness and sociability, endless connections and contacts and conversations make it impossible to focus. You realize that you will not be able to\n  pay proper attention unless you find some solitude, but you are not sure how this might work out for you.\n\nYou want to get something done \u2013 something that feels important to you and of its very nature has to be done alone (single-handed sailing, solo mountaineering and becoming a hermit are\n  three common examples, but there are others). The solitude is secondary to you, but necessary, so you are looking for a briefing. This group is quite small, I think; most of the people who\n  seriously want to do these sorts of things tend to be experienced and comfortable with a degree of aloneness before they become committed to their project.\n\nYou have come to the disagreeable awareness that you do not much like the people you are spending time with; yet you sense that you are somehow addicted to them, that it will be impossible to\n  change; that any relationship, however impoverished, unsatisfying, lacking in value and meaning, is better than no relationship; is better than being alone. But you aren\u2019t sure. You are\n  worried by the very negative responses you get whenever you bring the subject up.\n\nYou are experiencing a growing ecological passion and love of nature. You want to get out there, and increasingly you want to get out there on your own. You are not sure why this new love seems\n  to be pulling you away from sociability and are looking for explanations.\n\nYou are one of those courageous people who want to dare to live; and to do so believe you have to explore the depths of yourself, undistracted and unprotected by social conventions and norms.\n  You agree with Richard Byrd, the US admiral and explorer, who explained why he went to spend the winter alone on the southern polar ice cap in 1934: \u2018I wanted to go for experience\u2019s\n  sake; one man\u2019s desire to know that kind of experience to the full . . . to be able to live exactly as I chose, obedient to no necessities but those imposed by wind and night and cold, and to\n  no man\u2019s laws but my own.\u2019 You do not, of course, need to go all the way to Antarctica to achieve this, but you do need to go all the way into yourself. You feel that if you have not\n  lived with yourself alone, you have not fully lived. You want to get some clues about what you might encounter in this solitary space.\n\nYou feel \u2013 and do not fully understand the feeling \u2013 that you are missing something. You have an inchoate, inarticulate, groping feeling that there is something else, something more,\n  something that may be scary but may also be beautiful. You know that other people, across the centuries and from a wide range of cultures and countries, have found this something and they have\n  usually found it alone, in solitude. You want it. Whatever it is. You are reading this book not because you want to know how to be alone, which is perfectly easy as soon as you think about it, but\n  because you want to know why you might want to be alone; why the whole subject fills you with both longing and deep unease. You want to know what is going on here.\n\nBut actually the most likely reason why you are reading this book (like most books) is curiosity \u2013 why would someone write this book?\n\nAnd I can answer that question, so that is where I am going to begin.\n\nI live alone. I have lived alone for over twenty years now. I do not just mean that I am single \u2013 I live in what might seem to many people to be \u2018isolation\u2019 rather than simply\n  \u2018solitude\u2019. My home is in a region of Scotland with one of the lowest population densities in Europe, and I live in one of the emptiest parts of it: the average population density of\n  the UK is 674 people per square mile (246 per square kilometre). In my valley, though, we have (on average) over three square miles each. The nearest shop is ten miles away, and the\n  nearest supermarket over twenty. There is no mobile-phone connection and very little through-traffic uses the single-track road that runs a quarter of a mile below my house. Often I do not see\n  another person all day. I love it.\n\nBut I have not always lived alone. I grew up in a big family, one of six children, very close together in age, and in lots of ways a bit like a litter of puppies. It was not a household much\n  given to reflection or introversion \u2013 we were emotional, argumentative, warm, interactive. We did things together. I am still deeply and affectionately involved with all my siblings. I became\n  a student in 1968 and was fully involved in all the excitement and hectic optimism of those years. Then I was married and had two children. I became a writer. I have friends \u2013 friendship\n  remains one of the core values of my life. None of this looked like a life of solitude, nor a good preparation for living up a back road on a huge, austere Scottish moor.\n\nWhat changed was that I got fascinated by silence; by what happens to the human spirit, to identity and personality when the talking stops, when you press the off-button, when you venture out\n  into that enormous emptiness. I was interested in silence as a lost cultural phenomenon, as a thing of beauty and as a space that had been explored and used over and over again by different\n  individuals, for different reasons and with wildly differing results. I began to use my own life as a sort of laboratory to test some ideas and to find out what it felt like. Almost to my surprise,\n  I found I loved silence. It suited me. I got greedy for more. In my hunt for more silence, I found this valley and built a house here, on the ruins of an old shepherd\u2019s cottage. I moved into\n  it in 2007.\n\nIn 2008 I published a book about silence. A Book of Silence was always meant to be a \u2018hybrid\u2019 book: it is both a cultural history and a personal memoir and it uses the forms\n  and conventions of both genres melded into a single narrative. But it turned out to be a hybrid in another way that I had not intended. Although it was meant to be about silence, it turned out to\n  be also about solitude \u2013 and there was extensive and, I now think, justifiable criticism of the fact that it never explicitly distinguished between the two. Being silent and being alone were\n  allowed to blur into each other in ways that were confusing to readers. For example, one of the things I looked at in A Book of Silence was the actual physical and mental effects of\n  silence \u2013 ranging from a heightened sensory awareness (how good food tasted, how extreme the experiences of heat and cold were), through to some curious phenomena like voice-hearing and a\n  profound loss of inhibition. These effects were both reported frequently by other people engaged in living silent lives and experienced by me personally in specific places like deserts or\n  mountains. However, a number of commentators felt that these were not effects of silence per se, but of solitude \u2013 of being alone. After the book was published I also began to get letters\n  from readers wanting advice . . . and more often than I had anticipated, it was not advice on being silent but on being alone.\n\nSara\u2019s house.\n\nSome of this was because there are at least two separate meanings to the word silence. Even the Oxford English Dictionary gives two definitions which are mutually exclusive: silence is\n  defined as both the absence of any sounds and the absence of language. For many people, often including me, \u2018natural noises\u2019 like wind and running water do not \u2018break\u2019\n  silence, while talking does. And somewhere in between is the emotional experience that human-made noises (aeroplanes overhead, cars on distant roads) do kill silence even where the same volume of\n  natural sound does not.\n\nBut it was not just a question of definitions. I came to see that although for me silence and solitude were so closely connected that I had never really needed to distinguish them, they did not\n  need to be, and for many people they were not by any means the same. The proof cases are the communities where people are silent together, like Trappist monasteries or Quaker meetings.\n\nThe bedrock of the Quaker way is the silent meeting for worship. We seek a communal gathered stillness, where we can be open to inspiration from the Spirit of God and find\n      peace of mind, a renewed sense of purpose for living, and joy to wonder at God\u2019s creation.\n\nDuring our meetings for worship some may feel moved to speak: something anyone can do, as all are considered equal. Quakers do not have priests, or a hierarchy, as we believe all people can\n      have a direct relationship with God.\n\nYou do not have to be a Quaker to attend Quaker meetings, which are open to all. Meetings can be held anywhere, at any time, although they are often on Sundays in our Quaker meeting houses.\n      If you would like to join us and share in our stillness, you would be most welcome.\n\n(From the official Quaker website, www.quaker.org.uk)\n\nBut at a far simpler and less self-conscious level most people have had experiences of being silent but not alone: with someone very intimate, for example, you can be with them\n  for joyful hours without any need to speak; breast-feeding a baby and sitting with someone very near to death are experiences of silence with communion. And equally you can be alone but not silent\n  \u2013 for example, if you are watching TV or your neighbours are making an appalling amount of din while you are on your own next door.\n\nThere are also less emotionally charged times \u2013 if you go for a bike ride with someone, you are often silent and clearly not alone; if you sing to yourself, or call to your dog on a solo\n  walk, you are alone but not silent.\n\nOne of my favourite fairy stories is \u2018The Six Swans\u2019: in order to rescue her brothers who have been put under an enchantment and turned into birds, the heroine takes a vow to remain\n  silent for seven years (she also has to make each brother a vest out of flowers). The first half of her labour is done in solitude \u2013 she is alone deep in a forest and sits on the branch of a\n  tree to sew. Eventually a king comes riding by, falls in love with her, takes her back to his palace and marries her. They have three children together but she still does not speak. Terrible things\n  befall her but she holds to her vow, until just as she has been bound to a pyre, about to be burned as a witch because of her refusal to speak, the seven years are completed; her brothers are set\n  free from the spell and they rescue her. The heroine has two separate trials \u2013 the first is in isolation, and the second, in obvious and deliberate contrast, in a highly social situation\n  \u2013 but in both she is silent.\n\nObviously these two sorts of silence are not the same. But I was still confused, still having a hard job distinguishing them. So, having written a book about silence, I thought I would like to\n  write one about solitude. This is it. I am writing it because I think there is a serious social and psychological problem around solitude which we need to address. I am writing it because I would\n  like to allay people\u2019s fears and then help them actively enjoy time spent in solitude. But mainly I am writing it because I like writing books and I like solitude. It is a sort of two-for-one\n  deal for me.",

Being alone in our present society raises an important question about identity and well-being. In the first\n  place, and rather urgently, the question needs to be asked. And then \u2013 possibly, tentatively, over a longer period of time \u2013 we need to try and answer it.\n\nThe question itself is a little slippery \u2013 any question to which no one quite knows the answer is necessarily slippery. But I think, in as much as it can be pinned down, it looks something\n  like this:\n\nHow have we arrived, in the relatively prosperous developed world, at least, at a cultural moment which values autonomy, personal freedom, fulfilment and human rights, and\n    above all individualism, more highly than they have ever been valued before in human history, but at the same time these autonomous, free, self-fulfilling individuals are terrified of being alone\n    with themselves?\n\nThink about it for a moment. It is truly very odd.\n\nWe apparently believe that we own our own bodies as possessions and should be allowed to do with them more or less anything we choose, from euthanasia to a boob job, but we do not want to be on\n  our own with these precious possessions.\n\nWe live in a society which sees high self-esteem as a proof of well-being, but we do not want to be intimate with this admirable and desirable person.\n\nWe see moral and social conventions as inhibitions on our personal freedoms, and yet we are frightened of anyone who goes away from the crowd and develops \u2018eccentric\u2019 habits.\n\nWe believe that everyone has a singular personal \u2018voice\u2019 and is, moreover, unquestionably creative, but we treat with dark suspicion (at best) anyone who uses one of the most clearly\n  established methods of developing that creativity \u2013 solitude.\n\nWe think we are unique, special and deserving of happiness, but we are terrified of being alone.\n\nWe declare that personal freedom and autonomy is both a right and good, but we think anyone who exercises that freedom autonomously is \u2018sad, mad or bad\u2019. Or all three at once.\n\nIn 1980, US census figures showed 6 per cent of men over forty never married; now 16 per cent are in that position . . . \u2018male spinsters\u2019 \u2013 a moniker that\n    implies at best that these men have \u2018issues\u2019 and at worst that they are sociopaths.\n\nOne fears for these men, just as society has traditionally feared for the single woman. They cannot see how lonely they will be. But in time to ease my anxiety, a British friend came through\n    town . . . \u2018I want to get married,\u2019 he said. Finally. A worthwhile man.\n\n(Vicky Ward, London Evening Standard, 2008)\n\nIn the Middle Ages the word \u2018spinster\u2019 was a compliment. A spinster was someone, usually a woman, who could spin well: a woman who could spin well was financially\n  self-sufficient \u2013 it was one of the very few ways that mediaeval women could achieve economic independence. The word was generously applied to all women at the point of marriage as a way of\n  saying they came into the relationship freely, from personal choice not financial desperation. Now it is an insult, because we fear \u2018for\u2019 such women \u2013 and now men as well \u2013\n  who are probably \u2018sociopaths\u2019.\n\nA woman who could spin well was financially self-sufficient.\n\nBeing single, being alone \u2013 together with smoking \u2013 is one of the few things that complete strangers feel free to comment on rudely: it is so dreadful a state (and probably, like\n  smoking, your own fault) that the normal social requirements of manners and tolerance are superseded.\n\nNo one is supposed to be single.\n\nIn the course of my life, I have loved and lost and sometimes won, and always strangers have been kind. But I have, it appears, been set on a life of single blessedness.\n\nI haven\u2019t minded enough. But now I kind of do. Take dinner parties. There comes a moment, and that question: \u2018Why don\u2019t you have a partner?\u2019\n\nIt is usually asked by one of a couple, with always a swivel of the eye to his or her other half, so really two people are asking this question.\n\nAnd I struggle to answer: \u2018I have never found the right person . . . I am a sad and sorry manchild . . . I am incapable of love . . . I am a deviant, and prefer giraffes.\u2019\n\nAny answer will fail to satisfy. The questioner expects no happy answer. I am only covering up my bone-deep, life-corroding loneliness. The questioners know this, and the insight they\n      believe it affords comforts them. They are safe.\n\nThey look down from the high castle of coupledom, protected from such a fate. But if I were to ask: \u2018Why have you settled for him? Why are you stuck with her? Were you so afraid of\n      being alone?\u2019 such questions would be thought rude, intrusive . . .\n\nSingle people can also feel this way about other single people, and about themselves. You see, no one is supposed to be single. If we are, we must account for our deficiencies.\n\n(Jim Friel, BBC online magazine, November 2012)\n\nIn both these examples it is clear that thinking the single person \u2018sad\u2019 is not enough for society. Normally we are delicate, even overdelicate, about mentioning\n  things that we think are sad. We do not allow ourselves to comment at all on many sad events. Mostly we go to great lengths to avoid talking about death, childlessness, deformity and terminal\n  illness. It would not be acceptable to ask someone at a dinner party why they were disabled or scarred. It is conceivable, I suppose, that a person happy in their own coupled relationship\n  really has so little imagination that they think anyone who is alone must be suffering tragically. But it is more complicated than that: Vicky Ward\u2019s tone is not simply compassionate. Her\n  \u2018fears for these men\u2019 might at first glance seem caring and kind, but she disassociates herself from her own concern: she does not fear herself, \u2018one fears for\n  them\u2019. Her superficial sympathy quickly slips into judgement: a \u2018worthwhile\u2019 man will be looking for marriage; if someone is not, then they have mental-health \u2018issues\u2019\n  and are very possibly \u2018sociopaths\u2019.\n\nHere is a list of the traits of a sociopath, based on the psychopathy checklists of H. Cleckley and R. Hare:\n\nGlibness and Superficial Charm\n\nManipulative and Cunning\n\nGrandiose Sense of Self\n\nPathological Lying\n\nLack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt\n\nShallow Emotions; Incapable of real human attachment to another\n\nIncapacity for Love\n\nNeed for Stimulation\n\nCallousness/Lack of Empathy\n\nPoor Behavioural Controls/Impulsive Nature\n\nEarly Behaviour Problems/Juvenile Delinquency\n\nIrresponsibility/Unreliability\n\nPromiscuous Sexual Behaviour\n\nLack of Realistic Life Plan/Parasitic Lifestyle\n\nCriminal or Entrepreneurial Versatility\n\nDoes Vicky Ward honestly believe that every un-coupled man over thirty-five is suffering from this serious mental illness? It seems that she does.\n\nWhy? Could it be that she is frightened? In her article she comments that, in New York, where she is based, there is an excessive number of single women to men, so if she feels that a committed\n  partner is necessary to a woman\u2019s sense of well-being then she might well feel threatened by men who want something different. Projecting psychopathology onto people who do not agree with\n  you, especially about values, is a very old strategy.\n\n\u2018They are sad and therefore they are mad\u2019 is a good cover for fear. There is an alternative, though: \u2018They are not sad and therefore they are bad.\u2019 My mother was widowed\n  shortly after she turned sixty. She lived alone for the remaining twenty-five years of her life. I do not think she was ever reconciled to her single status. She was very much loved by a great\n  many, often rather unexpected, people. But I think she felt profoundly lonely after my father died, and she could not bear the fact that I was enjoying solitude. I had abandoned marriage, in her\n  view, and was now happy as a pig in clover. It appalled her \u2013 and she launched a part-time but sustained attack on my moral status: I was selfish.\n\nIt was \u2018selfish\u2019 to live on my own and enjoy it.\n\nInterestingly, this is a very old charge. In the fourth century AD, when enthusiastic young Christians were leaving Alexandria in droves to become hermits in the Egyptian\n  desert, their Bishop Basil, infuriated, demanded of one of them, \u2018And whose feet will you wash in the desert?\u2019 The implication was that in seeking their own salvation outwith the\n  community, they were neither spreading the faith nor ministering to the poor; they were being selfish. This is a theme that has cropped up repeatedly ever since, particularly in the eighteenth\n  century, but it has a new edge in contemporary society, because we do not have the same high ethic of \u2018civil\u2019 or public duty. We are supposed now to seek our own fulfilment, to\n  act on our feelings, to achieve authenticity and personal happiness \u2013 but mysteriously not do it on our own.\n\nToday, more than ever, the charge carries both moral judgement and weak logic. I write a monthly column for The Tablet (a Catholic weekly magazine) partly about living on my own. One\n  month I wrote about the way a conflict of duties can arise: how \u2018charitable\u2019 is the would-be hermit meant to be about the needs and demands of her friends? One might anticipate that a\n  broadly Catholic readership would be more sympathetic to the solitary life because it has such a long (and respected) tradition behind it. But I got some poisonous letters, including one from\n  someone who had never met me, but who nonetheless felt free to pen a long vitriolic note which said, among other things:\n\nGiven that you are obviously a person without natural affections and a grudging attitude towards others it is probably good for the rest of us that you should withdraw into\n    your own egocentric and selfish little world; but you should at least be honest about it.\n\nAnd yet it is not clear why it is so morally reprehensible to choose to live alone. It seems at first sight a great deal less offensive than the blatant aggression which the\n  choice seems to provoke in so many people. It is very hard to pin down exactly what people mean by the various charges they make, probably because they do not know themselves. For example, the\n  \u2018sad\u2019 charge is irrefutable \u2013 not because it is true but because it is always based on the assumption that the person announcing that you are, in fact, deeply unhappy has some\n  insider knowledge of your emotional state greater than your own. If you say, \u2018Well, no actually; I am very happy\u2019, the denial is held to prove the case. Recently someone trying to\n  condole with me in my misery said, when I assured them I was in fact happy, \u2018You may think you are.\u2019 But happiness is a feeling. I do not think it \u2013 I feel it. I may, of course,\n  be living in a fool\u2019s paradise and the whole edifice of joy and contentment is going to crash around my ears sometime soon, but at the moment I am either lying or reporting the truth. My\n  happiness cannot, by the very nature of happiness, be something I think I feel but don\u2019t really feel. There is no possible response that does not descend almost immediately\n  to the school-playground level of \u2018Did, didn\u2019t; did, didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nBut the charges of being mad or bad have more arguability.\n\nHowever, before we look at these arguments, the first thing to establish is how much solitude the critics of the practice consider \u2018too much\u2019. At what point do we feel that someone\n  is developing into a dangerous lunatic or a wicked sinner? Because clearly there is a difference between someone who prefers to bath alone and someone who goes off to live on an uninhabited island\n  which can only be reached during the spring tides; between someone who tells a friend on the telephone that they think they\u2019ll give tonight\u2019s group get-together a miss because they\n  fancy an evening to themselves, and someone who cancels all social engagements for the next four months in order to stay in alone. Age and circumstance are, or can be, factors, and so is what\n  someone is doing in their solitude: there is a difference between a teenager who has not left their bedroom for four months and an adult who decides to walk the whole Pennine Way alone for their\n  holiday. If you are writing great books or accomplishing notable feats, we are more likely to admire than criticize your \u2018bravery\u2019 and \u2018commitment\u2019. Most of us did not find\n  Ellen MacArthur sad, mad or bad when she broke the single-handed sailing circumnavigation record in 2005, even though it meant being entirely alone for 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes and 33\n  seconds.\n\nMost of us did not find Ellen MacArthur sad, mad or bad.\n\nThere are no statistics for this, but my impression is that we do not mind anyone being alone for one-off occasions \u2013 particularly if they are demonstrably sociable the rest of the time\n  \u2013 or for a distinct and interesting purpose; what seems to bother us are those individuals who make solitude a significant part of their life and their ideal of happiness.\n\nIt is all relative anyway. I live a solitary life, but the postman comes most days. Neil, the cheerful young farmer who works the sheep on my hill, roars by on his quad bike at least three or\n  four days a week, passing with a cheerful wave. I have a phone; I go to church every Sunday. I have friends and children and sometimes they even come and visit me. Small rural communities are\n  inevitably, oddly, social \u2013 I know the names and something of the circumstances of every single person who lives within five miles of me. (There is nothing in the world more sociable than a\n  single-track road with passing places.) And even if I lived in deeper solitude I would live with a web of social dependencies: I read books that are written by people; I buy food which is produced\n  by people and sold to me by people; I flick on the light switch and a nationwide, highly technical, constantly maintained, laboriously manufactured grid delivers electricity and my lights come on.\n  It would be both mad and bad not to acknowledge and give thanks for all this not-aloneness.\n\nSo it is useful to ask oneself how much solitude it takes to tip over into supposed madness or badness. It is certainly useful to ask those who are being critical or accusatory of anyone who\n  seems to enjoy more aloneness than they themselves feel comfortable with. After all, Jim Friel in the earlier quote is at a dinner party, hardly an activity of the classic antisocial\n  loner.\n\nIn his book Solitude, Philip Koch attempts to break down the accusations into something resembling logical and coherent arguments, so as to challenge them: he suggests that the critics\n  of silence find the desire for it \u2018mad\u2019 (or tending towards madness) because:\n\nSolitude is unnatural. Homo sapiens is genetically and evolutionarily a herd or pack animal. We all have a basic bio-social drive: \u2018sharing experience, close\n    contiguity of comradeship and face-to-face cooperative effort have always been a fundamental and vital need of man (sic) . . . the individual of a gregarious species can never be truly\n    independent and self-sufficient . . . Natural selection has ensured that as an individual he must have an abiding sense of incompleteness.\u2019 People who do not share this \u2018force of\n    phylic cohesion\u2019 are obviously either deviant or ill.\n\nSolitude is pathological. Psychology, psychiatry and particularly psychoanalysis are all insistent that personal relationships, ideally both intimate and sexually\n    fulfilled, are necessary to health and happiness. Freud originated this idea and it has been consistently maintained and developed by attachment theorists (like John Bowlby) and particularly\n    object relation theorists (like Melanie Klein) \u2013 and is generally held and taught throughout the discipline. (This may also underpin the idea that you are not \u2018really\u2019 happy on\n    your own. Since you need other people to be mentally well, then thinking you are happy alone is necessarily deluded.)\n\nSolitude is dangerous (so enjoying it is masochistic). It is physically more dangerous, because if you have even quite a mild accident on your own there will be no\n    one to rescue you; and it is psychically dangerous because you have no ordinary reality checks; no one will notice the early warning signs.\n\nThese three arguments do have a kind of coherence. They are based on assumptions that \u2013 were they correct for all people at all times \u2013 would indeed need to be\n  answered. I personally think (and I\u2019m not alone) that they are not correct in themselves and do not adequately allow for individual difference. I hope to demonstrate this as we go through the\n  book.\n\nThe \u2018moral\u2019 arguments, however, at least as Koch defines them, are rather more absurd. This second group of objections to solitude tend to be exactly the opposite of the first group.\n  Solitude is morally bad because:\n\nSolitude is self-indulgent. The implication here is that it is hedonist, egotistic and seeking its own easy pleasure \u2013 that somehow life alone is automatically\n    happier, easier, more fun and less nitty-gritty than serious social engagement, and that everyone in the pub is exercising, comparatively at least, noble self-discipline and fortitude, and\n    spending twenty-six hours a day in the unselfish miserable labour of serving their neighbours\u2019 needs.\n\nSolitude is escapist. People who like being alone are running away from \u2018reality\u2019, refusing to make the effort to \u2018commit\u2019 to real life and\n    live instead in a half-dream fantasy world. They should \u2018man up\u2019, get real, get a grip. But if social life is so natural, healthy and joyous as contemporary society insists, why would\n    anyone be \u2018escaping\u2019 from it?\n\nSolitude is antisocial. Well of course it is \u2013 that\u2019s the point. This argument is tautological. But \u2018antisocial\u2019 is a term that carries\n    implicit rather than explicit moral condemnation; it is clearly a \u2018bad thing\u2019 without it being at all clear what it might mean. All this actually says is \u2018solitude is preferring\n    to be alone rather than with others/me [the speaker] and I am hurt.\u2019 It is true, but is based on the assumption that being alone is self-evidently a bad thing, and being social is equally\n    self-evidently a good thing.\n\nSolitude evades social responsibility. This implies that all of us have something called a \u2018social responsibility\u2019, without defining what that might be\n    or consist of; but whatever it is, for some unexpressed reason it cannot be done by a person who is \u2013 for however much of their time \u2013 alone.\n\nNow clearly, even here, there are some interesting discussions to be had.\n\nWhat exactly do personal relationships provide that nothing else can offer? Could, for example, Anthony Storr be right and creative work offers compensatory alternative or even better\n  gratification? Or a sense of meaningfulness? Could some people\u2019s peaceful happy solitude function as an antidote, or even a balance, to the frenetic social activity of others? What, exactly,\n  is our social responsibility in a society where most people feel powerless? How does multiculturalism work in terms of individuals as opposed to groups? Why does other people\u2019s claim to be\n  happy in a different way from oneself provoke so much anxiety \u2013 and why is that anxiety so commonly expressed as judgement, condemnation, rather than genuine concern? How does a society\n  choose which issues it allows itself to be judgemental about, if it has no clear idea of the ultimate good?\n\nAnd above all, why are these conversations not happening?\n\nI believe they are not happening because of fear. Fear famously paralyses creativity, stultifies the imagination, reduces problem-solving ability, damages health, depletes energy, saps\n  intelligence and destroys hope. And also it does not feel good.\n\nFear muddles things up; it is difficult to think clearly when you are scared. When we are frightened we tend to project this onto other people, often as anger: anyone who seems different starts\n  to feel threatening. And one problem with this is that these projections \u2018stick\u2019. As Jim Friel put it in his article, \u2018single people can also feel this way about other single\n  people, and about themselves\u2019. Of course they can \u2013 if you tell people enough times that they are unhappy, incomplete, possibly insane and definitely selfish there is bound to come a\n  cold grey morning when they wake up with the beginning of a nasty cold and wonder if they are lonely rather than simply \u2018alone\u2019.\n\nIn addition there is a contemporary phenomenon which adds to the problem: the mass media make money out of fear.\n\nYou may have noticed that the UK experiences waves of grim killer diseases \u2013 even though proportionately very few people actually get these illnesses. A successful \u2018media\n  illness\u2019 has to meet quite particular criteria \u2013 among other things, it has to have a very complex official name and a very vivid popular one: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy\n  (and its human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease) aka mad cow disease was perfect. The illness should also be terminal but rare (CJD only occurs in one in one million\n  people per year, worldwide, and the majority of these cases have no link whatsoever with contaminated beef products) so that it is most unlikely that any readers will actually contract it; and if\n  possible it has to be caused by the greed and stupidity of someone else (the food industry and farmers in this case).\n\nDiseases are quite easy to manipulate in order to rack up the right sort of fear \u2013 the sort that sells papers. And there are other fears to play on. At the moment a very popular\n  media-inspired terror is the threat of the \u2018loner\u2019.\n\nOnce upon a time, and not very long ago, the word \u2018lone\u2019 had rather heroic and adventurous connotations: the Lone Ranger was not sad, mad or bad; Texas freely and proudly adopted its\n  nick name: The Lone Star State. But recently \u2018loner\u2019 has become media shorthand for \u2018psychotic mass murderer or sex fiend\u2019. If you look up \u2018loner\u2019 on Wikipedia\n  you will find this alphabetical list of related terms:\n\nAvoidant personality disorder\n\nAutism\n\nByronic hero\n\nDysfunctional family\n\nHermit\n\nHikikomori\n\nIntroversion\n\nLoneliness\n\nLone wolf (trait)\n\nMajor depressive disorder\n\nMisanthropy\n\nRecluse\n\nSchizoid personality disorder\n\nSocial phobia\n\nSocial rejection\n\nSolitude\n\nTragic Hero\n\nI have put into italics the four terms which do not directly correlate with \u2018sad, mad or bad\u2019, although the context of the list raises questions about even them\n  \u2013 is it okay to be \u2018introverted\u2019? Are hermits actually crazed? Is solitude like Major Depressive Disorder? Are Byronic heroes lonely? But what are more interesting are the\n  absences: adventurer, sensitive, mystic, creative genius, bereaved, castaway/Crusoe, victim of solitary confinement, wanderer.\n\nGreta Garbo was a famous loner, though in fact she never said \u2018I want to be alone\u2019 (the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya, whom Garbo played in Grand Hotel (1932), said it). She\n  was a very great actress: the film historian David Denby wrote in 2012 that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be\n  exaggerated. \u2018Worlds turned on her movements.\u2019 She was sufficiently successful to retire at thirty-five after making twenty-eight films. Near the end of her life \u2013 and she lived\n  to be eighy-five \u2013 she told Sven Broman, her Swedish biographer (with whom she was cooperating), that \u2018I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had\n  to force myself to go to the studio . . . I really wanted to live another life.\u2019 So she did.\n\nIn retirement she adopted a lifestyle of both simplicity and leisure, sometimes just \u2018drifting\u2019. But she always had close friends with whom she socialized and travelled. She did not\n  marry but did have serious love affairs with both men and women. She collected art. She walked, alone and with companions, especially in New York. She was a skilful paparazzi-avoider. Since she\n  chose to retire, and for the rest of her life consistently declined opportunities to make further films, it is reasonable to suppose that she was content with that choice.\n\nIt is in fact evident that a great many people, for many different reasons, throughout history and across cultures, have sought out solitude to the extent that Garbo did, and after experiencing\n  that lifestyle for a while continue to uphold their choices, even when they have perfectly good opportunities to live more social lives. On average they do not turn into schizoid serial killers,\n  predatory paedophiles or evil monomaniacs. Some of them in fact turn into great artists, creative thinkers and saints \u2013 however, not everyone who likes to be alone is a genius, and not all\n  geniuses like to be alone.\n\nGreta Garbo; a famous loner.",

      "content": "#### 2. How We Got Here\n\nI am convinced that we need to explore how we have arrived in this odd situation where we are so frightened of being alone that we aggress, or even apparently hate, those who\n  want to be alone. We refuse, as a society, to extend to them the normal tolerance of difference on which we pride ourselves elsewhere. We stigmatize them. We deny their capacity to identify their\n  own emotions. We fret if we do not have 24/7 social connection with others; we go to bizarre lengths to acquire partners (even though we then get rid of them with increasing frequency). I have\n  already said that I believe that fear is at the root of many people\u2019s deep unease about, or even terror of, being alone. I want to go further now, and argue that the roots of this fear lie in\n  a very deep cultural confusion. For two millennia, at least, we have been trying to live with two radically contrasting and opposed models of what the good life would or should be.\n\nCulturally, there is a slightly slick tendency to blame all our woes, and especially our social difficulties, either on a crude social Darwinism or on an ill-defined package called the\n  \u2018Judaeo-Christian paradigm\u2019 or \u2018tradition\u2019. Apparently this is why, among other things, we have so much difficulty with sex (both other people\u2019s and our own); why\n  women remain unequal; why we are committed to world domination and ecological destruction; and why we are not as perfectly happy as we deserve. I, for one, do not believe this \u2013 but I do\n  believe that we suffer from trying to hold together the values of Judaeo-Christianity (in as much as we understand them) and the values of classical civilization, and they really do not fit.\n\nThe Roman Empire reached its largest territorial extent under the Emperor Trajan, who reigned from AD 98\u2013117. At this point it comprised most of what is now Western\n  Europe and some of Eastern Europe and the whole Mediterranean basin. It was a highly efficient state which spread its cultural and technological influence, as well as its military organization, to\n  its conquered territories. One of the reasons for its success was its unusually cohesive culture, which was based in its original republican ethos of patriotism, citizenship and civic\n  responsibility. Even after the Republic collapsed in 27 BC, when Augustus Caesar became Emperor, these values remained central.\n\nThis value system was underpinned by laws which forbade the patricians (the upper classes) to be involved in commerce \u2013 this meant that little of their energy could go into\n  \u2018business\u2019 or the accumulation of personal wealth through private or entrepreneurial activities. The young male Roman patrician was educated almost entirely for public office, with a\n  curriculum consisting of rhetoric (public speaking), Roman traditions and public affairs. Such a youth grew up believing that the route to personal \u2018fulfilment\u2019 lay in public life,\n  structured through the cursus honorum (literally \u2018the course of offices\u2019), a sequence of elected roles or \u2018jobs\u2019, which began with serving as an officer in the army\n  and went on through a variety of legal and ceremonial duties up to provincial governor. Although (a bit like the President of the USA) having a lot of money helped you to get elected, you still had\n  to charm the voters. The successful Roman was therefore a public and social figure: that was the ideal. (The word honorum originally meant simply \u2018public office\u2019, but you can\n  easily see the connection with the concept of honour. This crossover is still apparent in contemporary Britain in phrases like \u2018the New Year\u2019s honours list\u2019: where public\n  recognition and status is given to people who are deemed to have performed public services.)\n\nPrivate morality, interiority and personal \u2018fulfilment\u2019 score rather low in such a culture. Honour meant service to the state, the holding of elected public offices. An honourable\n  person \u2013 though in Roman society this exclusively applied to men\u2013 was judged through his standing in the eyes of other people. His first moral duty was the appropriate\n  \u2018performance\u2019 of the self in public \u2013 generosity, self-control, being law-abiding and a good public speaker were among the necessary qualities. The judgement of your fellow\n  citizens was the measure of your worth. Even bathing was a social event. You were not privately clean, you had to be seen to be clean by your fellow citizens; perhaps unsurprisingly, nudity seems\n  to have carried unusually little shame or embarrassment in Roman culture.\n\n\u2018In men of the highest character and noblest genius there is to be found an insatiable desire for honour, command, power and glory,\u2019 wrote Cicero \u2013 a man who himself\n  represented and articulated these highest Roman ideals. Marcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343 BC) was a statesman, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul and\n  constitutionalist. He was also a major intellectual, and introduced Romans to Greek philosophy, which further emphasized the social virtues.\n\nAlthough we now think of Greek philosophy as highly abstract, disembodied and rarefied, it concluded that human nature was essentially social and communal. Aristotle wrote: \u2018It is strange\n  to make the supremely happy man a solitary, since man is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others.\u2019\n\nThe very word \u2018civilization\u2019 comes from the Latin word civis which meant a citizen, just as the words \u2018polite\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019 come from\n  polis, the Greek word for \u2018city\u2019.\n\nBut even as this culture reached its greatest height, the Mediterranean world saw the extremely fast rise of a \u2018new\u2019 religion, Christianity, which broke out from its Jewish roots and\n  expanded across the Empire. Christianity proposed a set of values almost directly in opposition to the Roman one. They were distinctly unimpressed by Cicero\u2019s \u2018insatiable desire for\n  honour, command, power and glory\u2019. In fact they were initially sublimely indifferent to politics altogether, since they believed the world was going to end soon and that what mattered was\n  preparing oneself for the immediate return of the Lord Jesus and an apocalyptic final judgement. Their core values focused around a personal (interior) relationship with God and holiness, humility,\n  obedience and poverty. They had a sense of personal integrity which was very unlike the public morality of the Roman world.\n\nFor example, they refused to perform the required traditional sacrifice. Actually many Romans did not have any personal belief in their national divinities, but they saw the performance of\n  religious rituals as part of their public duty to the State. What concerned them was good public order. The problem with the Christians was persistent civil disobedience and a deep-rooted culture\n  clash. It is hard to imagine two sets of values \u2013 the silent, unworldly (even anti-worldly) Christians and the social, public and political virtues of the Roman world \u2013 more radically\n  different. The meteoric success of this innovative cult must have felt extremely threatening to traditional Romans.\n\nBefore these tensions could work themselves through and find accommodation with each other, the situation changed totally. In AD 410 the city of Rome fell to\n  Alaric\u2019s Visigoth army. The sacking and looting of Rome was a terrible shock to the whole Mediterranean world. There was a deep sense that something had changed forever. Historians still tend\n  to treat 410 as the end of the Classical era and beginning of the Middle Ages.\n\nWith the collapse and break-up of the Empire an odd and confusing thing happened. In a highly turbulent and unsettled Europe, broken up into small fragmentary kingdoms and dealing with the\n  constant inflow of new groups of territorially aggressive cultures from the north-east, the Church and particularly the monks \u2013 the heirs to the solitary traditions of the desert \u2013\n  became one of the principal forces of social cohesion, continuity and culture. It would be fair to say that of the two competing ideologies of the late Roman period (the public vs the private; the\n  social vs the solitary) the Christian model won, but only by giving up its core values \u2013 accepting the \u2018world\u2019, embracing politics, power and even militarism. Western Europe moved\n  into the early modern period with a profound confusion between the values of the social and the solitary; and an unacknowledged but profound belief that people on the \u2018opposite side\u2019\n  were threatening civilization itself and were therefore very frightening.\n\nThe situation was inherently unstable. For the last thousand years, social history has seen a continual seesaw between these two sets of values \u2013 and therefore a constant worry and\n  restlessness about how to balance the social communal good against solitary interior freedom.\n\nUntil the fourteenth century, solitude was highly valued. The great \u2018media celebrities\u2019 of the period were the saints \u2013 and a remarkable number of them were solitary: ascetic\n  monks or hermits; people going into self-imposed exile and rejecting the civilized world; women choosing not to participate in marriage, their only socially conventional lifestyle choice. The\n  greatest virtue was to \u2018save your own soul\u2019 and develop an intimate relationship with the transcendent. Those with more political ambitions (usually kings and would-be kings) could buy\n  themselves out by endowing monasteries and building churches \u2013 so that their souls could be prayed for by someone else.\n\nIn the fourteenth century the Renaissance, and in the sixteenth century the Protestant Reformation, challenged this dominant paradigm in rather different ways. But the eighteenth century saw a\n  seismic shift. The Enlightenment (or Age of Reason) quite consciously generated a radical shift back towards a more Roman understanding of human society.\n\nThe Enlightenment deliberately sought to re-establish the ethics and moral paradigm of the Classical era. This was reflected in many more ways than purely intellectual ones: an aesthetic style\n  evolved which was happily called neoclassicism and affected literature (especially poetry), fashion (men started to wear plain dark clothes and spotless linen neckcloths to demonstrate how chaste\n  and clean they were; women wore simpler, plainer frocks in fragile cottons and fine silks) and particularly architecture, gardening and \u2018town planning\u2019.\n\nEdinburgh, which self-consciously referred to itself as \u2018the Athens of the North\u2019, built the New Town quite deliberately and knowingly to reflect this understanding of the city as a\n  model of civilization, using classical architecture to represent their rational, civilized, democratic and free society.\n\nInevitably these changes also affected private morality. The citizen was to be judged by social deportment rather than inner holiness. In Northanger Abbey Jane Austen has her heroine,\n  Catherine Morland, weigh the correctness of her actions after a quarrel with her closest friends against such Enlightenment standards:\n\nShe had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted merely her own gratification . . . no, she had attended to what was due to others,\n    and to her own character in their opinion.\n\n(Chapter 13, my italics)\n\nFor all the era\u2019s emphasis on civility, tolerance and liberty, most Enlightenment writers despised solitude, finding it both repellent and immoral. Edward Gibbon, author\n  of the famous Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776\u201388), wrote:\n\nThere is perhaps no phase in the moral history of mankind of a deeper or more painful interest than this ascetic epidemic. A hideous, distorted and emaciated maniac, without\n    knowledge, without patriotism, without natural affection, spending his life in a routine of useless and atrocious self-torture . . . had become the ideal of nations which had known the writings\n    of Plato and Cicero and the lives of Socrates and Cato.\n\nJames Wilson was even blunter:\n\nAn ascetic monk or \u2018self-secluded man\u2019, possibly a sulky egotistical fellow, who could not accommodate himself to the customs of his fellow creatures. Such beings\n    do very well to write sonnets about now that they are (as we sincerely trust) all dead and buried, but the reader may depend upon it, they were a vile pack.\n\nEdinburgh New Town employed classical architecture to represent the city\u2019s rational, civilized, democratic and free society.\n\nSad, mad and bad, in fact!\n\nBy the very end of the eighteenth century, however, a new mood began to cut across the refined elegance of neoclassical enlightenment. Ideas of freedom and \u2018rights\u2019 began to conflict\n  with the civic- and social-minded atmosphere; the careful public performance of mannerliness felt restrictive and a sort of anti-Enlightenment developed surprisingly fast into the Romantic\n  movement. Like neoclassicism, it came with both philosophical and aesthetic baggage. Some of the principle ideas included:\n\nThe elevation of emotion over reason and of the senses over the intellect.\n\nIntrospection and the legitimate engagement with the self; a sort of heightened awareness of one\u2019s own moods and thoughts.\n\nA construction of the artist as a free creative spirit.\n\nAn emphasis on imagination and spontaneity as a way to spiritual truth.\n\nA heightened appreciation of the beauty of nature, particularly in its most sublime and awe-inspiring aspects.\n\nWith such a set of concepts it is not surprising that would-be artists had somehow to escape from the coils of social convention and slip back into primal innocence so that\n  they could access their deepest emotions and find their own individual \u2018voice\u2019. Suddenly there was a plethora of writers praising the value of being alone. William Wordsworth\n  articulated this more explicitly than most in his poem \u2018The Prelude\u2019:\n\nWhen from our better selves we have too long\n\nBeen parted by the hurrying world, and droop,\n\nSick of its business, of its pleasures tired,\n\nHow gracious, how benign, is Solitude.\n\nIn a way, this Romantic vision could almost be seen as a return to the early Christian paradigm: the authentic inner self, or true soul, is obscured and weakened by too much\n  worldliness and corrupting materialism. The person desiring perfection must flee into the desert and nurture the inner life in solitude. The difference is, of course, that the idea of God has been\n  replaced by the idea of the ego as quasi-divine.\n\nThrough the nineteenth and twentieth centuries this idea extended its reach. Originally it had been understood as a route for \u2018geniuses\u2019, for especially endowed talents, but\n  gradually, as this set of ideas met with wider ideas of equality and human rights, everyone became a genius.\n\nThis might well have led to a renewal of the values of solitude, but in fact it had, as we know, the opposite effect. This was partly because the concept of freedom and rights had other\n  important dimensions \u2013 and many of those required collective actions; among them widening the vote, the trade-union movement, the various campaigns for national freedom (Byron, the great\n  Romantic hero, died in the war to liberate Greece), the struggle against slavery and the two activist phases of the women\u2019s liberation movement. These necessarily pulled people into social\n  association and demonstrated the power and effectiveness of collective engagement.\n\nAt the same time a general improvement in health, the enormous stresses of increasingly alienated labour and a lowering of inhibition about sex made personal relationships a more important\n  source of pleasure and personal fulfilment. The theme of sexual and emotional satisfaction was picked up as a central issue in the early psychoanalytic movement, so that solitude began to seem not\n  only impossibly difficult but also unhealthy.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century the conflict in values continued. In one sense you could argue that the present model\u2013 which emphasizes \u2018fulfilment\u2019 as a \u2018human\n  right\u2019, by widening (but thinning) one\u2019s social environment, while seeking the individual good (rather than the communal good) within it \u2013 was a clever compromise. But because\n  this model is so brittle, it is inevitably defensive and particularly punitive towards anything that tries to challenge it.\n\nThis almost absurdly brisk canter through some elementary history of European cultural paradigms reveals, I hope, a sort of pendulum swinging between various options for understanding the good\n  life; and in all them the question of solitude \u2013 both of our psychological capacity and of our ethical obligations to be alone \u2013 has been key to the understanding of society and\n  identity. As we came to the beginning of a new millennium, the pendulum was reaching an extreme outer limit of its range, in favour of relationality and social life. This has perhaps been obscured\n  by the cult of individualism, which has, rather oddly, developed simultaneously.\n\nThis situation is increasingly fragile. The global financial crisis has raised massive questions about the sustainability of consumerist capitalism based on perpetual economic growth; the\n  language of human rights appears to have delivered just about all the benefits (and they were real and substantial) that it can; people, at least in the developed world, are losing commitment to\n  participatory democracy and to liberal religious faith; and the eco-scientists are showing us with increasing clarity just how tenuous the whole life-as-we-know-it project is becoming. To go back\n  to Rome, the barbarians are at the gate. In these circumstances solitude is threatening \u2013 without a common and embedded religious faith to give shared meaning to the choice, being alone is a\n  challenge to the security of those clinging desperately to a sinking raft. People who pull out and \u2018go solo\u2019 are exposing the danger while apparently escaping the engagement.\n\nNo wonder we are frightened of those who desire and aspire to be alone, if only a little more than has been acceptable in recent social forms. No wonder we want to establish solitude as\n  \u2018sad, mad and bad\u2019 \u2013 consciously or unconsciously, those of us who want to do something so markedly counter-cultural are exposing, and even widening, the rift-lines.\n\nBut the truth is, the present paradigm is not really working. Despite the intense care and attention lavished on the individual ego; despite over a century of trying to \u2018raise\n  self-esteem\u2019 in the peculiar belief that it will simultaneously enhance individuality and create good citizens; despite valiant attempts to consolidate relationships and lower inhibitions;\n  despite intimidating efforts to dragoon the more independent-minded and creative to become \u2018team players\u2019; despite the promises of personal freedom made to us by neoliberalism and the\n  cult of individualism and rights \u2013 despite all this, the well seems to be running dry. We are living in a society marked by unhappy children, alienated youth, politically disengaged adults,\n  stultifying consumerism, escalating inequality, deeply scary wobbles in the whole economic system, soaring rates of mental ill-health and a planet so damaged that we may well end up destroying the\n  whole enterprise.\n\nOf course we also live in a world of great beauty, sacrificial and passionate love, tenderness, prosperity, courage and joy. But quite a lot of all that seems to happen regardless of the\n  paradigm and the high thoughts of philosophy. It has always happened. It is precisely because it has always happened that we go on wrestling with these issues in the hope that it can happen more\n  often and for more people.",

      "content": "#### III. Rebalancing Attitudes to Solitude\n\nIf there is any credibility at all to the somewhat gloomy analysis with which I finished the previous section (and obviously I believe there is), then there is a serious\n  problem confronting us, at least in the developed world. We have arrived at a cultural moment when we are terrified of something that we are not reliably, or healthily, able to evade. Solitude can\n  happen to anyone: we are all at risk. There is no number of friends on Facebook, contacts, connections or financial provision that can guarantee to protect us. The largest, and fastest-growing,\n  groups of people living alone are women over seventy-five (bereavement creates solitude) and men between twenty-five and forty-five (the breakdown of intimate relationships creates solitude). Most\n  often, solitude catches people on the hop, as it were, and few of us can feel we will be securely and indefinitely supported by family, neighbourhood, community or even friendship. It is not\n  sustainable to live in defensive postures of fear and avoidance all the time.\n\nThe two most common tactics for evading the terror of solitude are both singularly ineffective. The first is denigrating those who do not fear it, especially if they claim to enjoy it, and\n  stereotyping them as \u2018miserable\u2019, \u2018selfish\u2019, \u2018crazy\u2019 or \u2018perverse\u2019 (sad, mad and bad). The second is infinitely extending our social contacts as a\n  sort of insurance policy, which makes social media increasingly possible.\n\nThe first is ineffective because of the risk that a whole range of circumstances may force someone into solitude involuntarily. Should this happen, the fear-and-projection strategy will turn\n  round and bite back: you will be the sad, mad, bad person, and this can only make a difficult situation very much worse. Additionally, since \u2013 as you will see \u2013 there is a good\n  deal of evidence that none of these worries are actually true, people pursuing this route will be obliged to cut themselves off from many ways of knowing about the actual world in which they are\n  living. This itself may well prove isolating: one of the problems with projected fears is that they do tend to make the scary thing or event more likely, rather than less likely, to occur.\n\nThe problems with the second option are more complex. In the first place, online social life necessarily entails disembodied relationships. Yet we are a culture that places an extremely high\n  value on sexual and other physical relationships. We understand the limits of language and have an awareness of how much information is carried by non-linguistic communication \u2013 by body\n  language, expression and \u2018tone\u2019. Relationships without these elements are necessarily partial.\n\nRobin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, argues that there is a neurological limit to the number of people that most human brains have a capacity to perceive as\n  fully developed, complex individuals. Dunbar fixes the number at 150. Michael Hibbert, who claims to have the most Facebook friends in the world, has 8,924. This must, at the very least, change the\n  meaning of the word \u2018friend\u2019.\n\nIn fairness, I should point out that not everyone agrees with me here. There are other reasons for using social media than to generate a plethora of \u2018thin\u2019 relationships.\n\nMy friend Anne Wareham the garden writer \u2013 someone who definitely knows how to be alone and often is \u2013 believes that the New Media creates real communities of choice:\n\nWhen we first came to live in the countryside we knew no one. We spent some lonely years building up friendships and those rarely with really like-minded people. And old\n      friends were more difficult to see.\n\nThat really was solitude and I remember my frantic efforts to get online when I first heard of the internet and when it wouldn\u2019t have offered much anyway \u2013 no one there.\n\nBut they are there now, and social media introduces you to people around the whole wide world. With Twitter I have met people who share my particular preoccupation with being serious about\n      serious gardens and they are rare \u2013 but if you have the world to search you can find like-minded people and they find you. This has also enabled a lively dialogue on the website I edit,\n      www.thinkingardens.co.uk.\n\nFor someone like me, who values solitude, it\u2019s ideal. I can manage my time and manage my contact with the world, and give real time and effort where and when I choose.\n\nNow I am conscious that my mother-in-law might perhaps need institutional care one day. She is computer literate and therefore of a generation which may no longer find themselves in the\n      isolation of an institution full of people with nothing in common but age \u2013 because they will have the freedom of the web.\n\nIt\u2019s all an enormous luxury and freedom.\n\nNonetheless I believe our fear of solitude is real and is in many ways disabling. I do not believe that running away from this reality is effective, protective or even socially\n  beneficial.\n\nSo what follows are ideas for overturning negative views of solitude and developing a positive sense of aloneness and a true capacity to enjoy it. It is not progressive \u2013 you do not have\n  to do the various exercises in the order I am offering them, but I do suggest that you start with number 1. I recommend starting with the exercises that feel as though they make the most obvious\n  sense to you, and which do not seem too stressful.\n\nAlthough, as I have said, this programme is not progressive, it is cumulative. Like all learning experiences, you need a combination of theory and practice, so I have tried in the pages that\n  follow to alternate ideas that might strengthen your desire for and reduce your fear of solitude with ways in which you might, in practice, develop your taste for and skill at it.",

      "content": "#### 1. Face the Fear\n\nOn the very first page of this book I observed that in a practical sense it is not actually very difficult to be alone. Almost everyone is alone some of the time. So any\n  suggestions for developing a happier relationship with solitude are going to be building on your actual experience. This should be encouraging.\n\nOf course there are people for whom solitude is in reality far more difficult to find than I have implied: for example, the single parent of 2-year-old triplets; people living with some sorts of\n  physical illness, disability or other high-dependency condition; those confined in overcrowded prisons, forced to share a cell; young people with overanxious and controlling parents. But for most\n  of us it is not that complicated. Even those whose circumstances apparently make it hard can refer themselves to Catherine of Siena (1347\u20131380), who, despite living in a household where there\n  were at least twelve children (her mother had twenty-five babies but many of them did not survive, so the numbers changed frequently) and the family cloth-dying business was carried on, managed to\n  create for herself a \u2018hermitage of the heart\u2019. \u2018Build a cell inside your mind,\u2019 she instructed someone later, \u2018from which you can never flee.\u2019 Even her family\n  came to recognize and acknowledge that she was a \u2018solitary\u2019; that she lived alone within that communal household.\n\nIf you cannot find any regular solitude, any way to be alone, within the rhythm of your ordinary life, then at some level you might be avoiding it; if in addition you feel disgust or\n  contempt towards those who do prefer solitude to company, ask yourself if perhaps you are projecting and scapegoating. These behaviours are classic symptoms of fear.\n\nAlthough we now use the word \u2018phobia\u2019 (from the Greek: [img]\u00f3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, Ph\u00f3bos, meaning \u2018fear\u2019 or \u2018morbid fear\u2019) pretty\n  loosely, for psychologists it is a distinct clinical condition. Wikipedia\u2019s definition is: \u2018A marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence or\n  anticipation of a specific object or situation.\u2019 It is seen as a type of anxiety disorder and has clear diagnostic criteria. Among these are:\n\n1. Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response.\n\n2. The person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable.\n\n3. The phobic situation(s) is avoided or else is endured with intense anxiety or distress.\n\n4. The avoidance, anxious anticipation or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person\u2018s normal routine, occupational (or academic)\n        functioning or social activities or relationships.\n\nAmong the clinically recognized \u2018phobic stimuli\u2019 are various aspects of aloneness: autophobia is the fear of being isolated or alone; monophobia is the fear of\n  solitude.\n\nA survey in 2008 suggested that more than 13 million people in the UK have a terror of being out of mobile-phone contact. These individuals experience anxiety and panic symptoms when they run\n  out of battery or credit, lose their phone or have no network coverage. They are suffering from \u2018no-mobile phobia\u2019, which has been given the name nomophobia and could affect up\n  to 53 per cent of mobile-phone users.\n\nOf course I am not seriously contending that everyone who cannot enjoy being alone has a pathological psychological disorder, but there some interesting parallels. For example, phobias are often\n  \u2018learned\u2019 or inherited, rather than acquired through a particular traumatic encounter. They have a strong cultural element. The real reason why I am looking at phobias here, however, is\n  because of the ways they can be treated.\n\nThe standard, and highly effective, treatment for phobias is a combination of CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, a popular talking therapy that seeks to change how you think and what you do to\n  help you feel better) and desensitization. Using this as a model, I would suggest that the best treatment for a non-clinical fear of being alone is learning more about it and exposing yourself to\n  solitude, initially in very low \u2018doses\u2019:\n\nAccept the fact that fear is at least one element in your dislike and avoidance of solitude.\n\nStudy the benefits and joys of being alone (read this book \u2013 and others suggested in the \u2018homework\u2019 section).\n\nBuild up various strategies for being alone, starting with the least threatening and most pleasurable ones you can imagine.\n\nIf you can tolerate solitude in the shower \u2013 have a bath instead: it takes longer, and because it is quieter it is easier to be aware of being alone. Become more aware\n        of moments of solitude and how they make you feel.\n\nSpend some time alone where there are other people, but only those not known to you; railway travel is good for this, and so is shopping alone.\n\nSpend the evening in a different room from the rest of your household.\n\nTurn your mobile off. Remember, 8 per cent of the adults in Britain \u2013 over 5 million of us \u2013 do not have a mobile phone. Large swathes of the country do not have\n        even 2G coverage. But life goes on.\n\nStart small.\n\nYou may surprise yourself. Once you feel secure in accessing solitude you may find that you like it, and feel its benefits and its joys; you cannot know until you try.\n\nThat is what happened to me. I had never lived alone in my life. I had never wanted to live alone. I perceived myself as a deeply sociable, extroverted human being with a particular grace for\n  friendship and highly sophisticated, noisy discussion. When asked, I would say my favourite leisure activity, my hobby, was deipnosophy (\u2018the art of or skill in dinner-table\n  conversation\u2019). When my marriage ended and I went to live alone in a little thatched cottage, I was constructing myself as the selfless heroine of a tragic failed love story. I was eagerly\n  anticipating being thoroughly miserable and having one more thing to \u2018blame\u2019 my ex-husband for.\n\nSpend some time alone where there are other people, but only those not known to you; railway travel is good for this.\n\nMy subconscious was a great deal smarter than my conscious mind.\n\nI started small. My first home alone was a semi-detached cottage in a small village, barely an hour outside London. My son came up at weekends; my friends visited; for some of the time I had\n  part-time jobs of a distinctly non-solitary kind (I was a writer-in-residence in a prison for two years). So I was only getting small doses of solitude initially. But, for me, it did not take long;\n  I could feel myself relax and expand; I had more energy, both for work and for physical exercise. I got fitter. I slowed down, woke up earlier and started to see the world more sweetly and in more\n  detail. Since I started living alone I have less and less trouble with the depression that I had assumed, throughout my adult life, was a part of my personality.\n\nIt took me nearly two years to realize what it was that was making me so happy. Then I got greedier and greedier for solitude: now, as I said, I live in rather splendid isolation in a house\n  designed (by me) for solitary living, in an area where most days I do not see anyone. The joy of long periods of solitude has also increased my joy in non-solitude: I love my children, my friends,\n  my colleagues as much as ever, and I attend to them better when I am with them \u2013 and enjoy them more. But, above all, I like me better. I think there is more of me to like \u2013 a deep\n  spaciousness of self, joyful, creatively and professionally productive and alert to both my interior and exterior life.\n\nTry it out for yourself. Respect but do not fear your own fear. Do not let it come between you and something that might be deeply enjoyable. Remember it is quite normal to be a bit frightened of\n  being alone. Most of us grew up in a social environment that sent out the explicit message that solitude was bad for you: it was bad for your health (especially your mental health) and bad for your\n  \u2018character\u2019 too. Too much of it and you would promptly become weird, psychotic, self-obsessed, very possibly a sexual predator and rather literally a wanker. Mental (and even physical)\n  well-being, along with virtue, depends, in this model, on being a good mixer, a team-player, and having high self-esteem, plus regular, uninhibited, simultaneous orgasms with one partner (at a\n  time).\n\nActually, of course, it is never this straightforward because at the same time as pursuing this \u2018extrovert ideal\u2019, society gives out an opposite \u2013 though more subterranean\n  \u2013 message. Most people would still rather be described as sensitive, spiritual, reflective, having rich inner lives and being good listeners, than the more extroverted opposites. I think we\n  still admire the life of the intellectual over that of the salesman; of the composer over the performer (which is why pop stars constantly stress that they write their own songs); of the craftsman\n  over the politician; of the solo adventurer over the package tourist. People continue to believe, in the face of so much evidence \u2013 films, for example \u2013 that Great Art can only be\n  produced by solitary geniuses. But the kind of unexamined but mixed messages that society offers us in relation to being alone add to the confusion; and confusion strengthens fear.\n\nOne of the best antidotes to fear is knowledge. To press the analogy a little, this is the CBT element that goes hand-in-hand with \u2018desensitization\u2019 in the effective treatment of\n  phobias.\n\nBut in reality there is nothing to be frightened of. There is no evidence whatsoever that even prolonged periods of being alone are detrimental to physical or mental health, so long as that\n  solitude is freely chosen.\n\nUnfortunately, in the arena of health, it is quite tricky to find that helpful knowledge: the effectiveness of solitude has not been tested by NICE and recommended as a \u2013 remarkably cheap\n  \u2013 NHS therapeutic intervention. In Solitude, Anthony Storr comments:\n\nToday, the fact that isolation can be therapeutic is seldom mentioned in textbooks of psychiatry. The emphasis is on group participation . . . [I] regret that the average\n    mental hospital can make little provision for those patients who want to be alone and who would benefit from being so.\n\nIn consequence it is quite hard to find facts and figures on the effects (negative as well as positive) of solitude in relation to health. \u2018Being alone is good for your\n  health\u2019 is exactly the sort of proposition that is singularly difficult to test. You would need a very large-scale longitudinal study, with a control group, to measure anything useful,\n  because of the problems of eliminating all the random factors that can so easily sneak in here.\n\nIt is not just a matter of \u2018lies, damned lies and statistics\u2019, it is also about what research gets funded. And in the absence of full, meticulous, controlled experimental research it\n  becomes startling easy for people to read almost anything they want to into figures.\n\nHere, to put a case that undermines my own, is a statement about floatation tanks (floatation tanks are devices offered by spas or alternative health centres, and consist of a \u2018bath\u2019\n  filled with highly salinated, body-temperature water, in which the user can float without effort; they have closed lids and are basically anacoustic \u2013 you bob there in the dark, certainly\n  alone and also deprived of most sensory input). A tank:\n\nPromotes total calm, peaceful relaxation, eliminates fatigue and jet lag; improves sleep; alleviates stress \u2013 mental and physical; energizes, rejuvenates and\n        revitalizes.\n\nStimulates left/right brain synchronization; shifts brain waves from Beta to lower-frequency Alpha, Theta and even Delta; creates mental clarity, alertness; increases\n      creativity, problem-solving; heightens visualization; deepens meditation; expands awareness, intensifies acuteness of all the senses, accelerates learning.\n\nEnhances hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis; increases motivation, diminishes depression, anxiety and fear; facilitates freedom from habits, phobias and addictions.\n\nImproves athletic performance and helps prevent sports injuries, speeds healing process.\n\nDecreases the production of cortisol, ACTH, lactic acid and adrenaline; increases production of endorphins; quickens rehabilitation and recovery; relieves pain \u2013\n      arthritis, migraines, injuries etc.; boosts immune function.\n\nImproves circulation and distribution of oxygen and nutrients; reduces blood pressure, pulse, heart-rate and oxygen consumption.\n\nI have seen this list quoted in various places as a proof that Floatation is good for you, but there are no citations, no figures, no indication of which \u2018bit\u2019 of\n  the experience is so multiply enhancing. Then it transpires that the original can be found on the website of the Floatation Tank Association \u2013 it is an advertisement. Actually I have no\n  reason to believe that any of this is not true, and I do appreciate the enormous difficulties that many alternative therapies of all sorts find in getting decent trials up and running.\n  Moreover I am, from personal experience and wide reading, happily convinced that solitude is good for one\u2019s health (mental and physical), but in terms of offering authoritative scientific\n  reassurance to counter the common fears, I am not entirely happy with the available data.\n\nPerhaps it is better to approach this question anecdotally, through \u2018case histories\u2019. Because lives of solitude have been seen by so many different societies as both heroic and\n  bizarre, there is a kind of fascination in solitary practitioners and therefore a fairly steady stream of biographical literature, across a prolonged historical period and from a range of cultures.\n  It is not difficult to find a wide selection of individuals who practised a wide range of solitary lifestyles and simply look and see if there is any suggestion that being alone is dangerous rather\n  than beneficial.\n\nAnthony the Great (AD 251\u2013356) is widely credited as the first Christian hermit, and the founding father of monasticism. In 285 he went out into the Egyptian desert\n  and lived in complete isolation in a ruined fort at Der el Memum (Pispir) for twenty years. Athanasius, his friend and biographer, describes his emergence from this long solitude in some detail.\n  Anthony announced his intention of coming out and sent for some local workmen to help him dismantle his protective \u2018fortifications\u2019. This attracted a curious crowd who, Athanasius says,\n  were very all very \u2018surprised\u2019 to find he was neither emaciated nor deranged, suggesting clearly that this was the expectation. But he emerged physically fit and eminently in his right\n  mind.\n\nDespite these negative expectations, the rest of Anthony\u2019s life seems remarkably sane; and he lived to an extreme old age (105, according to tradition, at a period when life expectancy was\n  much lower than it now is), alone in the desert, still physically and mentally fully active, so his health was evidently not damaged. He spent the five or six years after he left Pispir sharing his\n  experiences and training and organizing the new movement that had grown up around his fort. His success in both establishing a genuinely innovative spirituality and in creating structures that\n  enabled the whole desert-hermit movement to develop over the following three centuries (and expand in an adapted form into Europe and become the basic impulse for monasteries) hardly suggests any\n  serious damage.\n\nAfter this teaching period he withdrew again into solitude, which he pursued with \u2018joyful determination\u2019 on his so called \u2018inner mountain\u2019. This second period of\n  solitude, which lasted for the remaining forty-five years of his life, lacked the extremity and rigour of his time in Pispir. He freely met and talked with those who came out to see him, sometimes\n  walked back to visit his community in Pispir and, according to Athanasius, went twice to Alexandria. He was very much loved and respected, partly for his serene good humour and tranquil heart.\n\nOddly enough, the fact that he remained abundantly normal did not change the common terror that solitude was likely to drive people mad.\n\nAnthony\u2019s life-pattern, a period of training, a period of extreme isolation, followed by teaching and public ministry and then a gentler withdrawal into seclusion, has been repeated ever\n  since with surprising frequency and across a range of cultures. Tenzin Palmo is a contemporary example who has followed Anthony\u2019s old road.\n\nJetsunma Tenzin Palmo is a British-born Tibetan Buddhist nun and probably one of the best-known solitaries of our time. She was born in 1943 in Hertfordshire, but moved to India when she was\n  twenty and began training, the only woman in a community of over 100 male monks. She found this, not surprisingly, very difficult, as she felt she was often deprived of both higher teaching and\n  respect because of her gender, and she gradually moved into a life of more solitude. From 1976 she lived for twelve years alone in a cave in the Himalayas, and for the last three of these in\n  complete isolation. Even though her solitude was broken into in an abrupt and potentially damaging way (one day a policeman arrived saying she had twenty-four hours to appear in the nearest town as\n  her visa had expired and she had to leave the country), she appeared unruffled and healthy. She also emerged with a great determination to improve the position of Buddhist nuns. She spent the\n  following years in Europe teaching, lecturing and raising funds for what, in 2000, became the Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in Himachal Pradesh, India. Again, like Anthony, after this period of\n  teaching and organizing she is speaking again of \u2018retreat\u2019, of going back to her solitary lifestyle.\n\nLike Anthony too she seems marked not just by sanity but by a benign and slightly ironic humour. She appears tolerant, witty and articulate and the many pictures of her show a woman in her\n  seventies in good health and spirits. She is, apparently, an extraordinarily good public speaker and teacher, and continues to work, with considerable success, for the spiritual rights of Buddhist\n  women.\n\nTenzin Palmo: Marked not just by sanity but by a benign and slightly ironic humour.\n\nSadly, a number of individuals embracing a life of radical solitude have gone very mad indeed \u2013 like Marguerite de la Rocque, marooned for two years on an island in the St Lawrence Seaway\n  in 1641, who was assaulted and haunted by demons, although she recovered on her return to France, or Alexander Selkirk, the probable model for Robinson Crusoe, who was never able to return to\n  social life after his rescue, and lived in a cave in Scotland \u2013 but so have a number of people who have not spent any significant time alone. Overall I can find no evidence whatsoever that\n  there is a higher incidence of lunacy, chronic ill health or early death among the solitary than in the population at large, though I admit that this would be extremely difficult to measure.\n  Although there are intense experiences and sometimes frightening issues to work through, being alone can be beneficial and is certainly not detrimental to well-being, provided the individuals\n  have freely chosen it. A good deal of the \u2018scientific evidence\u2019 for the danger to physical and mental health comes from studies of people in solitary confinement. There is no\n  question that compulsory punitive isolation is extremely dangerous to the human psyche \u2013 and can lead to a particularly hideous form of psychosis. But to compare freely chosen adventures into\n  the world\u2019s wilder places, or the experience of the divine and the depth of the self, to the ordeal of prisoners is a bit like comparing the feelings of a woman pregnant with a wanted baby,\n  basking in support and encouragement, to a woman similarly pregnant but as a consequence of rape, and facing shame and poverty. Of course no one should expect them to feel the same way.\n\nSo the biggest danger of solitude is fear \u2013 and often fear mixed with both the derision and judgement of others. Those exploring solitude can reasonably anticipate accusations of madness,\n  selfishness and stupidity; and since of course there are going to be elements of all three in all of us, these can sink their barbs in deep, depriving us of joy, confidence and faith; and into the\n  space thus created madness, egotism and idiocy can sneakily enter. Fear is more likely to undermine health than being alone is.",

      "content": "#### 2. Do Something Enjoyable Alone\n\nThe most commonly offered reason for not doing something like regular exercise is \u2018I don\u2019t have the time . . .\u2019 Often this is a pretty transparent excuse\n  (\u2018I don\u2019t have time to go to the doctor, but I do have time to play computer games\u2019). But in fact many of us do live extremely busy and pressured lives, and particularly if we\n  share a home with others, find it difficult to see where yet another clump of hours can be fitted into a life which feels, and perhaps is, already short of them.\n\nThis is a genuine difficulty in relation to solitude, because it is too easy to think of it as a \u2018new\u2019 sort of time, which will have to be carved out of other activities. Usually we\n  cannot choose whether we are alone at work, so if we want to experiment with solitude it seems as though it will have to be in our \u2018spare\u2019 or leisure time. But as a society we have\n  constructed leisure as predominantly a communal activity. People who indulge in solitary hobbies are treated as \u2018odd\u2019, if not contemptible: \u2018geeks\u2019, \u2018nerds\u2019,\n  \u2018anoraks\u2019 \u2013 trainee \u2018loners\u2019, in all likelihood!\n\nThere are some popular leisure activities which cannot be enjoyed alone \u2013 team sports are an obvious example, as are Scottish reel dancing, board games and gossip. The activities that can\n  only be enjoyed alone form a smaller but significant group \u2013 reading being perhaps the most obvious one. But there are a very large number that can be, and often are, done either in a group\n  or alone, like listening to or making music, walking, gardening and watching TV.\n\nIt is interesting, occasionally, to look in detail at how one does actually spend one\u2019s leisure time \u2013 within the working week, during non-working days like weekends and on holiday.\n  Such a list, made honestly, usually shows us just how much time we waste doing nothing in particular at all \u2013 \u2018neither what we want nor what we ought,\u2019 as C. S. Lewis described\n  it. But more importantly it reveals that most of us have a pretty clear division between \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018leisure\u2019. This distinction is a strong feature of post-industrial\n  societies and simply did not exist before that. It is a common belief that so-called \u2018advanced societies\u2019 have more leisure than people used to have \u2013 but anthropologists now\n  recognize that hunter-gatherer societies have the most leisure and that \u2018down time\u2019 is one of the biggest losses of modernity. Even in mediaeval Europe the peasant had far more holidays\n  than a middle-class salaried worker has now.\n\nAs well as reducing our leisure hours, modern societies have also massively increased the amount of \u2018maintenance\u2019 time we feel is essential for all that washing and cleaning and\n  grooming and decorating \u2013 ourselves and our homes. This is partly because we have separated \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018maintenance\u2019: a great deal of necessary maintenance now takes\n  double the time to perform, because first we have to work to earn the money that enables us to do the task. If you are living by subsistence agriculture you might barter to some extent, but you\n  never need to go shopping. It is also partly because over the last couple of centuries we have raised and elaborated our ideas of necessary maintenance: far from providing more leisure\n  time, labour-saving domestic devices have made a higher standard of cleanliness obligatory \u2013 a daily bath or shower, daily clean underwear, regular changes of bedding, frequent hair-washing\n  and so on \u2013 unknown to even prosperous households a century ago.\n\nBut the real reason why maintenance takes more time is because we own so many more things, all of which need maintaining. We work longer hours to buy the things, and then we spend more hours\n  managing and looking after them, and so as we become money-richer we also become more leisure-poor.\n\nWe are leisure-poor, then, because the combined burden of work and maintenance takes up so much of our time and because we have compartmentalized the three activities. Moreover, in addition to\n  compartmentalizing them in time, we have also divided them in space \u2013 we use an increasing amount of our day to move between the locations where the three things take place. There are other\n  ways to be.\n\nI live on a high moor in south-west Scotland. Not much flourishes here except black-face \u2018free range\u2019 sheep. Like many infertile upland areas it got left behind in the years after\n  the 1939\u201345 war. There was no electricity until 1972; the thirteen miles of un-metalled single-track road between one village and the next had thirteen gates which had to be opened and\n  closed. Each farm was isolated from its neighbours \u2013 and most people worked alone. Every summer, though, they had Common Shearing: five or six farms would get together and shear all the\n  sheep, farm by farm; the shearers sitting in a circle on shearing stools, chatting and singing as they worked. The whole family from each farm would come, and whosever farm the shearing was at that\n  day fed everyone. All the older people in this glen remember Common Shearing as a social activity, even though hand-shearing is hard work and an economic necessity. Electricity, as well as a\n  sharply declining population, ended Common Shearing \u2013 power-shears are too fast and also too noisy for sociability. Work and leisure are no longer seamless.\n\nEven in mediaeval Europe the peasant had far more holidays than a middle-class salaried worker has now.\n\nLife patterns like this have had a long-term influence on our ideas about \u2018leisure\u2019. When people worked alone, or with a tiny and unchanging group like the family, and leisure and\n  work were more closely entwined than they now are \u2013 markets (work) were also fairs (leisure) \u2013 hours spent not alone were social occasions in predominantly solitary lives. So leisure\n  became associated with group activities and with sociability. Most of our team and competitive sports evolved from local and traditional games; much of our preferred music (the orchestra, the\n  group, the choir) likewise emerged from communal activity. Even the word \u2018holiday\u2019 is derived from the concept of Holy Days, when mediaeval peasants did not have to perform work duties\n  but did have to go to church \u2013 a profoundly corporate event.\n\nNow most of us do not work alone. We do not even work in the noisy dangerous places that so isolated individual workers in nineteenth-century factories. But still when we think about\n  \u2018leisure\u2019 in our time-stressed, noisy lives, we tend to think of social rather than solitary activities; and think there is simply no space, once we have built in work, maintenance and\n  \u2018leisure\u2019, for time to be alone.\n\nThis is why it is worth rethinking the leisure you already enjoy and seeing if there are ways of increasing your time alone within that framework. This has the additional advantage of relieving\n  some of the anxiety about solitude by associating it with an activity you already know you enjoy.\n\nCommon Shearing was a social activity, even though hand-shearing was hard work and an economic necessity.\n\nRunning alone can allow you to hit the mute button on the world [. . .] and take full advantage of exercise\u2019s stress-busting benefits. \u2018Running alone can be a\n    meditative experience where you get to really think and concentrate or completely clear your mind and zone out,\u2019 [a psychotherapist, Michelle] Maidenberg says. [. . .] \u2018You have to\n    practise letting go of the inner chatter that can get in the way of what you want to accomplish,\u2019 [sports psychologist Cindra Kamphoff says]. \u2018And that\u2019s something you have to\n    do on your own.\u2019\n\n(Runner\u2019s World, March 2013)\n\nJogging as a physical discipline was really only established in the 1960s. (1968 saw the first use of the noun \u2018jogger\u2019, in New Zealand.) This may explain why it is\n  one of the few leisure activities that it is normal to see people doing alone: it was a response to the symptoms of modernity I have been describing, and so free of the residual \u2018leisure as\n  social\u2019 culture that preceded it. But in fact it is perfectly possible to do many other activities \u2013 outdoors and in \u2013 alone: go to the cinema, an art gallery or up a mountain;\n  fishing, gardening.\n\nReading and listening to music (or even playing an instrument) are obvious leisure activities which people do alone; but they do present an odd question. When you read, are you alone? When you\n  listen to music \u2013 particularly vocal music \u2013 is that a solitary activity? Or is it something you are doing in the company of the writer, the composer or the singers?\n\nSara, coming home.\n\nAnd above all, walking. For me, solitary walking, especially but by no means exclusively in wilder places, feels like a necessity as well as a joy. Solitary walking is a profound image of\n  independence and personal integrity. This makes it a good way to start exploring solitude; it is hard, when walking, not to feel good about yourself and about your capacity to be alone. In addition\n  it is available to almost everyone (you just walk a shorter distance if you are less fit), extremely cheap and embellished with happy associations with creativity, health and pleasure.\n\nThere is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that doing things alone intensifies the emotional experience; sharing an experience immediately appears to dissipate our emotional responses, as though\n  communicating it drained away the visceral sensation. I walk a good deal alone and my own experience is that this is very different from walking \u2013 even the same walks \u2013 in company. I\n  see and notice more and experience both the environment and my physical response to it in a very clear direct way. I also like walking with other people and do that too. The freedom to walk alone,\n  to eat alone, to travel alone, gives at the very least a wider potential pleasure. I would feel deprived if both were not possible for me.",

      "content": "#### 3. Explore Reverie\n\nIf you have the opportunity to watch a very young child, who is comfortable and content and neither hungry nor stressed, you can often observe an almost mystical, indescribable\n  expression: the baby\u2019s eyes are fixed on some object \u2013 very often a loved face \u2013 but are also unfocused. The child can take on a Buddha-like appearance \u2013 completely intent\n  and completely relaxed. Donald Winnicott believed that the capacity to be alone, to enjoy solitude in adult life, originates in these moments, with the child\u2019s experience of being\n  \u2018alone in the presence of the mother\u2019. (It does not need to be the biological mother who can offer the child this gift.) He postulates a moment in which the child\u2019s immediate\n  needs \u2013 for food, warmth, physical and emotional contact \u2013 have been satisfied, so that there is no need for the infant to be looking for anything; she is free just to be.\n\nWinnicott is describing in psychoanalytical terms what the Psalm writer wrote nearly 4,000 years earlier in spiritual terms:\n\nSee, I have set my soul in silence and in peace;\n\nAs the weaned child on its mother\u2019s breast,\n\nSo even is my soul.\n\n(Psalm 131:1\u20133)\n\nBoth Winnicott and the Psalmist are paying attention here to the experience of the child \u2013 but reflecting on my own life, I would say that at their very best these rich\n  and lovely moments are entirely mutual. I think that the hours spent thus with my children, especially after the night feeds, were key experiences which encouraged me (literally \u2013 gave me the\n  courage) to explore silence and solitude with hope and engagement.\n\nUnfortunately the way most of us were brought up, with an immensely strong focus on stimulation, engagement and interaction, means that too many of us have become adults with no experience of\n  and no capacity for solitude; not because we were neglected or frightened or emotionally isolated but simply because we got no safe practice in our infancy, always being joggled and sung to and\n  dandled and put down and picked up and talked to and interacted with.\n\nAs we grew up this continued. Despite the simple fact that the number of abductions and murders of children by strangers has not increased since the 1950s (approximately fifty children are\n  murdered each year in the UK; but over two-thirds of these are killed by a parent or principal carer, not by a stranger) and remains remarkably rare, the fear of it has increased exponentially.\n  This is very odd. It means that even people who can recall how joyful and important time alone was to them as children do not hand this message on to the next generation, but instead wrap the whole\n  idea of solitude in a blanket of anxiety and fear. This increases our nervousness about it, which makes us more reluctant to try it out and often more frightened than there is any need to be.\n\nLuckily there is a \u2018technique\u2019 (if that is the right word) for making good some of this loss. In 1913 the psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875\u20131961), having broken with his friend and\n  mentor Freud and been cut off by the impending war from much of his erstwhile social circle, experienced a sort of breakdown, what he himself described as a horrible \u2018confrontation with the\n  unconscious\u2019, including voice-hearing and hallucinations. He was terrified that he might be becoming psychotic, but bravely decided to confront his fears with a sort of self-analysis. In\n  solitude he worked himself into a state of reverie \u2013 a kind of concentrated daydreaming which he called \u2018active imagination\u2019. He deliberately and as detachedly as possible worked\n  through his own memories and dreams and his emotional reactions to them, and then recorded the sessions in notebooks.\n\nHe came to believe that this had proved extremely valuable, and in later clinical practice, especially with older clients, would help people learn to do this for themselves. Because of our\n  contemporary emphasis on object relations (and conceivably because of professional and ego-centred considerations) this \u2018treatment\u2019 has mainly dropped out of the mainstream (although\n  you can get some basic practical advice online if you search for \u2018self-analysis\u2019).\n\nEven without Jung\u2019s alarming experiences, reverie is a useful way of setting boundaries and patterns to an initial exploration of solitude. One way of using this idea is to place\n  yourself in comfort and safety and then actively seek significant memories of particular states of mind. One interesting feature that psychologists are uncovering is that when people seek moments\n  of happiness, particularly elevated, unitive moments \u2013 when the daydreamer uses the active imagination to remember feeling joyfully bound to the whole earth or even universe \u2013 they are\n  most likely to be associated with being alone, and often alone outside. Anthony Storr, in Solitude, associates this free-roaming solitary pursuit as a particular feature of highly creative\n  people, especially writers. But I myself suspect that it is writers who are best at recording these moments, and that anyone who has had the opportunity to be alone for even relatively brief\n  periods of time as a child can find and re-experience this intense pleasure.\n\nToo often such delights get overlaid by the more social demands of young adulthood, by our own fears of isolation and of being thought weird, and by the culturally inculcated terror of solitude.\n  Reverie is both highly pleasurable in itself and is also a fairly safe way of re-accessing memories.\n\nMost such acts of recall come with a startling vividness \u2013 this is one of the ways that people authenticate their own memories. \u2018It must be true because it feels so complete and\n  satisfying; it must be true because it feels true.\u2019 In fact, we now know that memories of childhood are extremely unreliable and are to a large extent confabulations; they are creative acts,\n  constantly in flux and transformation. To me this makes the amazing frequency with which people remember childhood moments of solitude in a positive and often romantic glow all the more\n  interesting. It seems to suggest that as adults many of us have a deep and real longing for more solitude than we are presently getting.\n\nSuch practices can, incidentally, throw up quite disturbing material. If this all becomes consistently more frightening than either pleasurable or interesting, it is worth checking whether you\n  are actually exhaling enough (hyperventilation is easy to slip into and produces weird physical effects), and otherwise give yourself a break. I am not proposing this as necessary therapy, but as a\n  rather effective way to enjoy solitude more. If it does not work, does not achieve this end for you, do something different.",

Look at Nature\n\nBy \u2018look at nature\u2019 I do not mean \u2018get out into nature\u2019 \u2013 although, as I have already suggested, this is a very good thing to do when you are\n  alone. As I have described, one of the arguments deployed against those who want to be alone is that such a desire is \u2018unnatural\u2019.\n\nThis is a complicated sort of accusation, made up of so many strands that it is quite difficult to unravel and examine it, and indeed it has built itself so deeply into our culture and ways of\n  thought that we seldom even try to unravel and examine it. The word \u2018natural\u2019 has aggregated a confusingly wide range of meanings, some of which are in contradiction to each other. For\n  example, the Oxford English Dictionary, along with sixteen other separate meanings for \u2018natural\u2019 as an adjective, defines it both as something \u2018based upon the innate\n  moral feeling of mankind; instinctively felt to be right and fair\u2019 and as something \u2018in a state of primitive development, not spiritually enlightened. Unenlightened,\n  unregenerate.\u2019\n\nInterestingly, until very recently one thing that \u2018natural\u2019 did not mean was \u2018things like animals, trees, mountains and oceans\u2019, although this is often the implication\n  when people call something \u2018unnatural\u2019. We need to be alert to the implicit and conflicted moral judgement in the word itself because very often when people say something is\n  \u2018unnatural\u2019, they really mean \u2018I do not approve of it\u2019.\n\nNonetheless the idea that it is unnatural for human beings to be solitary is very ancient, and still exercises imaginative hold on many of us. When the Pentateuch \u2013 the first five books of\n  Scripture which are held in common by the three Middle Eastern monotheisms (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) \u2013 was given its final form, somewhere between 600 and 400 BC, the second version of the Creation story (Genesis 2) tells how the Lord God made Adam, breathed life into him and put him in the Garden of Eden alone (there were not even any\n  animals at this point) but then came to the conclusion that \u2018it is not good that the man should be alone\u2019. In an attempt to provide Adam with a fitting companion, the Lord God then\n  \u2018formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to the man\u2019. However, none of them seemed quite satisfactory, so the Lord God made a woman out of one of\n  Adam\u2019s ribs. And he was no longer alone. Quite why this one verse of Genesis has kept its resonance while the rest of the creation story has been militantly rejected is a bit mysterious.\n\nThis particular story, and its explicit articulation that it is \u2018not good\u2019 for people to be alone, has been extremely influential, but it is not by any means unique; many other\n  creation myths see the forming of human social units (often based on the sexually related couple, though sometimes on a sibling group) as a key moment in human development.\n\nThese myths are endorsed by popular science. The idea that human beings are a social species is not simply firmly embedded in our culture; it is supported by evolutionary theory, social\n  anthropology and archaeology. And obviously it does have some validity; because of reproduction, virtually no animals can be entirely solitary, but there is enormous variety in their sociability.\n  Some species of hamsters, for example, live extremely solitary lives, meeting each other very occasionally and almost exclusively for sex; other species, like ants or termites, are so highly\n  socialized that huge numbers of the members of any particular colony are not even capable of reproduction but devote themselves to the very highly organized support of their fertile\n  \u2018queen\u2019 and her young. But on the whole, popular \u2018sociobiologists\u2019 do not write bestsellers about termites and hamsters. They prefer more glamorous species.\n\nMost of our closer animal relatives, particularly primates \u2013 and specifically chimpanzees, with whom we share a full 98 per cent of our genetic make-up \u2013 are social beyond the direct\n  biological needs of feeding, reproduction and child-rearing: they play, groom each other, compete and fight, cooperate, exchange a range of vocalizations and continue to have relationships with\n  their own weaned \u2013 even mature \u2013 offspring. For most primates their social relations transcend immediate family groups. Like humans, it is apparently unnatural for primates to be\n  alone.\n\nHomo sapiens have one particular behaviour that is not shared with other primates \u2013 organized hunting. The collective hunt is, inevitably, a communal and social experience. It has\n  even been suggested that it is hunting as a group that led to the development of language, and the anthropological and archaeological evidence strongly supports the idea that the original human\n  societies were hunter-gatherers. Because of this there has been a tendency to compare ourselves and our social needs to other species who also hunt collectively \u2013 especially wolves and\n  lions.\n\nBut in making the claim that being alone is unnatural because we are fundamentally like other primates and hunting species, it is important to take a wider view of a species\u2019\n  \u2018lifestyle\u2019.\n\nLion packs are female-led. However, a newly arrived male lion will kill all the immature offspring of his predecessor. We would not justify such behaviour in human societies on the grounds that\n  it was \u2018natural\u2019.\n\nWolves are highly gregarious. But their social groups are organized on entirely familial lines. A pack usually consists of a group of sisters and their young and a single non-related male: if I\n  set up house with my sisters, sharing a single man as a sexual partner and the father of all our children, this would not be seen as a \u2018natural\u2019 relationship.\n\nNonetheless, the popular argument that it is somehow unnatural for human beings to be alone claims a scientific basis in the behaviours of primates and hunting-pack species. And to some extent\n  this makes good sense: humans have a biological need for sociability, if for no other reason than that it takes so long for our young to become independent; our survival requires us to support and\n  protect these generally pretty useless and vulnerable members, and that in itself needs some sort of social interaction (unlike, say, salmon, whose mothers abandon their eggs before they are even\n  fertilized, let alone hatched). All the archaeological evidence of the earliest human societies, together with the anthropological studies of different societies, make clear that Homo\n  sapiens is a social species and cements survival through a complex web of practical, kinship and cultural structures. It is \u2018natural\u2019 for humans to associate, cooperate and bond\n  both emotionally and ritually.\n\nBut it is wrong to assume that this necessary sociability, even in the obviously complex forms that exist among primates, means that individuals of other species never spend time alone. This is\n  simply not the case.\n\nGorillas sleep alone.\n\nGorillas, for example, despite living in groups, spread out and forage alone. They are capable of a range of vocalizations with distinct meanings \u2013 about twenty-five different sounds\n  (\u2018words\u2019) have been identified by researchers. One of the most common of these is a loud \u2018hoot\u2019, which can be heard for at least half a mile (0.8 km): obviously you do not\n  need to communicate audibly over such a distance if you are never separate from the rest of your social group.\n\nGorillas also sleep alone. Each evening they \u2018make camp\u2019, constructing new individual nests either on the ground or in trees. A suckling baby gorilla nests with its mother, but as\n  soon as it is weaned at about three years old, she teaches it to make its own nest and it sleeps there. Many animals sleep together even as adults, but the highly socialized gorillas (and other\n  primates too) sleep by themselves.\n\nMeanwhile orangutans, which are as nearly related to humans as gorillas, are far more solitary in their lifestyle. This species spends most of its daily life alone, although its young are more\n  gregarious.\n\nAnd not all lions or wolves live in packs: both species have a second form of organizational behaviour \u2013 individuals who live alone: the lone wolf and the nomad lion. Both lions and wolves\n  may maintain this status for life, or move in and out of it, setting up new prides or packs. These less-socialized individuals are not rare and are not created by external or unusual traumas\n  \u2013 they are, apparently, perfectly \u2018natural\u2019.\n\nCulturally we like the idea of the close-knit social group, so we tend to ignore how much hunter-gatherer activity is best done alone. The socially organized big-game hunt is surprisingly\n  inefficient: kill-rates vary from as low as 17 per cent up to about 40 per cent, which is not going to keep a community in food. Fishing, small-animal hunting and a great deal of vegetable\n  gathering are frequently done alone. The more northerly, tundra- and taiga-based, hunter-gatherer societies are more dependent on meat, since there is less edible vegetation: their huge and\n  famously complex reindeer hunts are highly socialized and collaborative \u2013 different small groups coming together to build elaborate traps and fences and runs to exploit the reindeer-herd\n  migrations. But these spectacular events are seasonal (like the Common Shearing I discussed earlier) and can as easily be seen as \u2018leisure\u2019; most gathering and hunting and fishing is\n  done more quietly alone.\n\nThe more, and the more sensitively, we look at what actually happens out there, beyond the boundaries of modernity \u2013 at the complexity of models and forms of social being \u2013 the more\n  we will be sceptical about anything being purely \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018unnatural\u2019. We will most certainly become increasingly aware that solitude, in greater or smaller\n  quantities, is simply a normal part of how it is to be.",

      "content": "#### 5. Learn Something by Heart\n\nThis suggestion may come as something of a surprise. What does the tedious, old-fashioned task of rote learning have to do with strengthening your capacity for and enjoyment of\n  being alone? Didn\u2019t we break away from that dead educational model decades ago? Now we have the internet, and calculators and mobile phones, why on earth would we want to clog up our brains\n  with those repetitive factoids \u2013 like times tables, irregular verbs and the dates of the kings of England?\n\nThere are a whole series of counterarguments and answers to these sorts of questions, beginning with the observation that there are other richer things to learn by heart \u2013 and note all the\n  connotations of \u2018heart\u2019 here; they include love and rhythm. If you find times tables or historical dates boring, learn something else \u2013 poetry, a foreign language, the\n  periodic table. But there are two particular answers which relate very closely to the joys of solitude and the fear of being alone: a well-stocked mind enhances creativity, and a mental store of\n  beautiful or useful items offers security, frees one from complete dependence on oneself and appears to aid balance and sanity in solitude.\n\nI have already suggested that solitude may be a necessity, and it is certainly a well-established aid to creativity. One reason why this is so is that the social presence of others distracts or\n  reconstructs a person\u2019s sense of their core self. So if, seized with inspiration, you need some material for your creative impulse to work on, you will undermine your own project if you have\n  to turn outside yourself to grasp the necessary information. Wordsworth\u2019s famous poem \u2018Daffodils\u2019 would have a very different effect if it ended:\n\nFor oft, when on my couch I lie\n\nIn vacant or in pensive mood,\n\nI have to rise and go and search\n\nOn Flickr, Google or YouTube.\n\nThe capacity to be creative is profoundly linked to the ability to remember: the word \u2018remember\u2019 derives from \u2018re-member\u2019, to \u2018put the parts back\n  together\u2019. So strongly was this felt to be the case that classical Greek mythology made Memory \u2018the mother of the Muses\u2019.\n\nThe Muses were the nine beautiful nymphs, the young women who represented the arts and inspired artists: Calliope (epic poetry); Clio (history); Euterpe (flutes and lyric poetry); Thalia (comedy\n  and pastoral poetry); Melpomene (tragedy); Terpsichore (dance); Erato (love poetry); Polyhymnia (sacred poetry); Urania (astronomy). Their father was Zeus, the chief of all the Gods, and their\n  mother was Mnemosyne \u2013 memory. We still use the word \u2018muse\u2019 to describe a woman who is an abiding influence on a male artist.\n\nChildren\u2019s memories used to be trained from primary school, but so-called \u2018rote learning\u2019 has gone out of fashion. A number of people, including me, think this is a pity. There\n  is a good deal to be said in favour of \u2018learning by heart\u2019.\n\nThe Muses: Nine beautiful nymphs who represented the arts and inspired artists. Their mother was Mnemosyne \u2013 memory.\n\nThe argument in favour of memorizing \u2018scales or times tables or verse\u2019 . . . has been attacked for years now \u2013 unfairly . . . Sense and memory are allies\n      . . . Rote learning is more like training than learning. It is the trellis on which a free thinker can climb. . . \u2018Memorization\u2019 used to be almost a synonym for\n      \u2018culture\u2019. [Now] it is a party trick . . . a waste of time . . . [Education] \u2018can only come from the initial submission of the student\u2019s mind to the body of knowledge\n      contained within specific subjects.\u2019. . . In education, submission is empowerment.\n\n(Christopher Caldwell, Financial Times, 16 November 2012)\n\nWhat we have memorized, learned by heart, we have internalized in a very special way. The knowledge is now part of our core self, our identity, and we can access it when we are\n  alone: we are no longer an isolated fragment drifting in a huge void, but linked through these shared shards of culture to a larger richer world, but without losing our \u2018aloneness\u2019. For\n  many people this resource, this well-stocked mental larder, offers food for thought, for coherence, for security, and must be one of the factors that turns \u2018isolation\u2019 into creative\n  solitude. This is a kind of cultural engagement that you cannot get from the web or from reading.\n\nAnother benefit of having a rich and multilayered collection of memorized material ready to hand, as it were, is more anecdotal. Solitary confinement, especially if accompanied by fear,\n  uncertainty or sensory deprivation, really does induce psychosis and lead to the breakdown of even apparently tough individuals. It is therefore worth looking carefully at the individuals who\n  survive such experiences intact; they obviously have an exceptional skill at being alone and we can learn from them. Over and over again this small and admirable group reports the value of having\n  deep-laid, secure material in one\u2019s memory-bank.\n\nIn 1949 Edith Hajos Bone was arrested in Hungary, where she was working as a journalist. She was kept in solitary confinement \u2013 often in the dark, sometimes in the wet, without any\n  recreational facilities (like books or even sewing), subjected to occasional interrogation sessions, and never told what she was charged with or given any information about her future at all: all\n  precisely the features most likely to lead to serious mental breakdown. She survived apparently entirely untouched. She ascribed this to her own mental discipline and intellectual resources. On a\n  daily basis she would walk herself, imaginatively, round cities she had visited; recite poetry \u2013 and translate it from one language to another; keep in touch with her own body through the\n  careful medical details she had had to learn by heart as a student doctor. In her autobiography she mentions several other sources of \u2018amusement\u2019, which relied on a well-filled mind:\n  for example, she extracted threads from her towel and wove them into cords:\n\nOne had to be careful not to be caught in the act of pulling threads out of the towel. These were only changed once a fortnight and so it took me about two months to get\n      the required thirty-two threads from which to plait my cord. Fortunately for myself, I had always been a fanatical lover of knots, and possessed that most remarkable publication, The Ashley\n      Book of Knots, which I had studied assiduously and which, in addition to knots, also contained a number of sinnets. I plaited a beautiful sinnet \u2013 a round one, the sort known as\n      coach-whipping \u2013 out of thirty-two threads in groups of eight.\n\n(Edith Bone, Seven Years Solitary (Hamish Hamilton, 1957).)\n\nThere are so many examples of the empowerment provided by having external material to hand \u2013 private, personal and learned along the pulses \u2013 that I do wonder if\n  the fear that our heads are empty and that we are without reliable points of connection is one of the causes of our contemporary terror of being alone. It is worth remembering that the joyful\n  desert hermits of the third to fifth centuries were almost entirely illiterate: their daily recitation of the psalms \u2013 the recommended and clearly much-loved rhythmical repetition \u2013 was\n  done entirely from memory, the rich fruit of \u2018rote learning\u2019.",

      "content": "#### 6. Going Solo\n\nOddly, the form of being alone which attracts least criticism is the one that is in many ways the most dangerous: the solo adventure. It feels strange to me that people who\n  choose to be alone in the comfort of their own house are regarded, and too often treated, as weirdos, while those who choose to be alone several thousand feet above the snowline or in a tiny boat\n  in the middle of Pacific Ocean are perceived as heroes. I am not entirely sure why this is the case; perhaps because so many people do not seem to understand (or to want to understand) what\n  \u2018being alone\u2019 is meant to be for, whereas being the first person to do something does strike chords for lots of us. Since almost every square inch of the world has now been\n  explored, doing so under especially tricky circumstances becomes the next new thing.\n\nCircumnavigation is a good example of this phenomenon: in 1522, only eighteen of the 200 sailors, in just one of the five ships which had set out in 1519 under Ferdinand Magellan, returned to\n  Spain. (Magellan himself was killed in the Philippines.) This not-entirely-successful expedition was greeted with extraordinary excitement and enthusiasm throughout Europe. When Francis Drake\n  returned from the second full circumnavigation nearly sixty years later he was welcomed ecstatically and knighted on board his ship, the Golden Hind. But after this, circumnavigation\n  became almost commonplace, until the very end of the nineteenth century when Joshua Slocum did it single-handed \u2013 alone. In 1969 Robin Knox-Johnston completed the circuit single-handed and\n  non-stop. The challenge to do something new led directly to the need to do it alone.\n\nThe same history plays itself out in mountaineering \u2013 Everest was first climbed in 1952 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay; in 1980 Reinhold Messner was the first person to climb it solo\n  (and without bottled oxygen) and in 1995 Alison Hargreaves was the first woman to make the ascent solo. Both these latter climbers regularly climbed with others \u2013 the need to do something not\n  done before pushed them forcibly towards solitary climbing.\n\nThe pattern is fairly constant with many other forms of extreme adventure: it is harder to do these sorts of things alone and so it becomes more of a challenge and, for many people, a more\n  heroic endeavour. It also appeals to something almost atavistic in many people who do not themselves want to be alone, and who are often highly critical of people who seek out more tranquil\n  solitude, but nonetheless find solo adventurers deeply romantic and fascinating.\n\nAt first sight it appears to be something of a contradiction, but if you want to experiment with being alone it is sometimes easier to do it by making it into an \u2018adventure\u2019 than by\n  staying safely at home. One of the most difficult things about being alone, as I have already outlined, is the distaste and open criticism of one\u2019s social circle. If instead of saying\n  \u2018I\u2019m going to take my holiday alone this year\u2019 you say \u2018I want an adventure; I am going to walk the West Highland Way / cycle to Istanbul / camp on an uninhabited island\n  \u2013 solo\u2019 you will get all sorts of interest and support. Some of this may be a bit curious or even bemused; people will ask \u2018why?\u2019 But they are far less likely to regard you\n  as sad, mad or bad.\n\nA word of warning: Magellan, Drake, Slocum and Knox-Johnston were all very experienced sailors. Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Messner and Hargreaves were highly skilled mountaineers. Undertaking\n  extreme adventures without previous experience and knowledge is dangerous \u2013 Donald Crowhurst ended up mad and dead in the first Golden Globe race; he had barely sailed single-handed at all\n  when he took his untested yacht out into the Atlantic; Chris McCandless, the \u2018hero\u2019 of the book (and film) Into the Wild, almost certainly died from being ignorant and\n  under-equipped. What is a bold adventure for one person is an immature folly for another. In personal terms an \u2018adventure\u2019 is something challenging that you have not done before but\n  have reasonable grounds for believing you could achieve \u2013 if you are brave, determined and lucky enough.\n\nOver the centuries a remarkably wide variety of individuals have spoken warmly of the enhanced sense of self they have found in doing something courageous on their own. Henry Thoreau wrote about\n  this sense of empowerment in Walden, when he explained why he had gone to live alone in a wood in Connecticut for two years in 1845\u201347:\n\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I\n      came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live\n      deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and\n      reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by\n      experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.\n\nI do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbours up.\n\nRichard Byrd, the US admiral and explorer, gave a similar explanation in the opening of his book Alone, in which he described his adventure alone through seven months\n  in the Antarctic:\n\nI wanted to go for experience\u2019s sake: one man\u2019s desire to know that kind of experience to the full . . . to taste . . . solitude long enough to find out how good\n    [it] really was . . . I wanted something more than just privacy . . . I would be able to live exactly as I chose, obedient to no necessities but those imposed by wind and night and cold, and to\n    no man\u2019s laws but my own.\n\nIf this approach to practising being alone appeals, I highly recommend travelling alone. This is mainly because you almost certainly know how to travel. You will only need to\n  add on the \u2018alone\u2019 bit to turn it into a solo adventure. Tradition says that the mountaineer George Mallory, who disappeared on Mount Everest in 1924 on his third attempt to reach its\n  summit, answered any questions about why he wanted to climb Everest with \u2018because it\u2019s there\u2019. Thoreau and Byrd, along with many others, seem to be answering \u2018because I am\n  me\u2019. They are doing these things to explore their own inner worlds as much as the external one. Byrd added \u2018Walking down 5th Avenue can be just as lonely as wandering in the desert\n  \u2013 but I contend that no one can be completely free who lingers within reach of familiar habits.\u2019\n\nI have certainly found for myself that solo adventures \u2013 of a distinctly more modest kind than these \u2013 have given me unexpected and rich material to write about, have deepened my\n  sense of myself as a free and autonomous individual and have provided a quality of challenge and reflection different from anything I have ever been able to achieve at home.\n\nYou can also, like the solo adventurers I have just mentioned, build up slowly. It is always less alarming (though less adventurous) to begin somewhere that they speak the same language as you\n  do; what about going to the Orkneys \u2013 without flying? The great austere stretch of Scotland north of the Highlands is not only stunningly beautiful, it is little visited and very\n  underpopulated; the landscape itself offers an experience of solitude. Or travel by bicycle to every mediaeval cathedral \u2013 adding all the resonance of \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 to your\n  adventure? Or camp out alone, even if it is only in your back garden?\n\nAlternatively you can go somewhere to do something you already know how to do, and like doing: scuba-diving on the Great Barrier Reef, art galleries in New York, shopping in Paris, the opera in\n  Vienna. Travelling in a country where you know no one and cannot speak the language creates particular demands; certainly you will feel more \u2018alone\u2019 when you cannot understand what\n  people around you are saying \u2013 no danger of eavesdropping, falling into casual chat or otherwise interrupting one\u2019s solitude. But at the same time discovering one\u2019s ability to\n  rise to such occasions is even more empowering.\n\nThe great austere stretch of Scotland north of the Highlands is not only stunningly beautiful, it is little visited and very underpopulated.\n\nThe idea is to push your own boundaries in the expectation of having a new kind of fun. The rewards are a double freedom \u2013 the freedom of knowing yourself and pleasing yourself beyond your\n  old comfort zone, and a deeper sense of achievement. You have done something most people are too scared to do. Solo travel gives you both these freedoms, while also usually attracting the\n  admiration and even envy of people who would not dare. Certainly there seems to be an inexhaustible appetite to learn more about solo adventures. There is a huge number of lectures, films,\n  autobiographies, novels and photographs by or about people who have had such experiences. They tend to confirm that individuals flourish creatively and psychologically if they do something that\n  feels courageous to them (and particularly if they have to overcome actual frightening moments) and exciting to others. One thing about \u2018pushing boundaries\u2019 is that they expand as you\n  do so. Beyond these \u2018beginner\u2019 solitudes, the whole world is waiting for you. You may end up feeling, as Thoreau came to feel, that you \u2018never found a companion that was so\n  companionable as solitude.\u2019\n\nAs a society we have a deep belief that travel \u2018broadens the mind\u2019. If there is any substance in the claim that things you do on your own are experienced more intensely than those\n  that you share with someone else, it seems highly likely that solo journeys will broaden the mind more than package holidays, or even independent travel with a companion.\n\nMost of us have a dream of doing something in particular which we have never been able to find anyone to do with us. And the answer is simple, really: do it with yourself.",

      "content": "#### 7. Train the Children\n\nThere is a strong \u2013 and I think well-founded \u2013 sense that solitude is a learned skill. We know that sociability is culturally acquired: think of all the hours we\n  put in to teaching children to \u2018share\u2019, not to bite each other, to be grateful, to moderate and manage anger and, as they get older, to dress appropriately, not to steal or lie and to\n  consider other people\u2019s feelings. No one expects this to come \u2018naturally\u2019 to children, even though we also believe that human beings are genetically programmed for group\n  interaction, are inherently social and need, for true flourishing, both to achieve intimate one-to-one relationships and to \u2018win friends and influence people\u2019. But far from\n  putting similar efforts into encouraging children to develop a healthy capacity to be alone, or to explore what being alone means to them, and to enjoy solitude, we go to extraordinary lengths to\n  \u2018protect\u2019 them from any such practice and experience. I believe that this disables them, or at the very least does not equip them for life events which at some time or another they are\n  extremely likely to encounter.\n\nIf you are scared of being alone yourself it can be challenging to allow your children to experience aloneness. We know that being alone is extremely important to some people \u2013 and may\n  happen to anyone. We know that solitude is almost a necessity for creativity and the development of a genuinely and richly autonomous sense of identity. We seek out a wide range of experiences for\n  our children \u2013 and want their schools to provide these too. We want young people to develop useful internal risk-assessment abilities, resilience and the capacity to remain strong and well in\n  future difficult situations. We want them to have rich imaginations, physical competence, freedom and as much joy as possible. All these things are enhanced by solitude and by the ability to enjoy\n  being alone sometimes.\n\nThere are some strategies for developing these skills in the young. Unfortunately, many child psychologists, and particularly the authors of popular childrearing \u2018textbooks\u2019, have\n  taken the view that a child\u2019s psyche is immensely fragile and must be cherished almost obsessively; that any fear is damaging and that children must be protected at all costs from any moment\n  of alarm, even if this means losing out on positive and enriching experiences the other side of that moment of fear. I feel that we, as a society, have allowed our own fear of solitude to affect\n  our judgement and encourage us to advocate ever greater levels of intervention, overprotection, stimulation and social interaction. Some childcare experts, however, have courageously stood out\n  against the tide of fashion: Anthony Storr and more recently Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods (2005), are examples worth exploring. However, the following list of ways to\n  give our children safe experience of and practice in solitude, though drawn from their and others\u2019 writing, are my own:\n\n1. Allow your newborn time for the infantile reverie I discussed earlier in the book. Let him or her just lie in your arms; do not seek emotional engagement, like\n        eye-contact, immediately. Enjoy for yourself the peace and warmth of being gazed at by your baby. If you cannot refrain from trying to engage with the child, sing \u2013 best of all,\n        wordlessly \u2013 rather than talk.\n\n2. Let your toddler play alone sometimes. Do not interfere or make reactive play obligatory. In my experience woods are a very good place to practise elementary solitude. This\n      is because the child can experience herself as unsupervised while you are actually very near. She can vanish behind a tree and believe she is alone, even though she is only a couple of metres\n      away and you can hear every move. Woods are very beautiful and fascinating to small people, while in fact being remarkably safe \u2013 there are no real predators, you can hear other people\n      approaching; unlike water, where children really can and do drown, not many bad things actually happen in a wood.\n\n3. Read them stories about children alone, who face real dangers and overcome them. This is the central moral message of classic fairy stories where the hero or heroine, alone\n      and in serious difficulties, turns things to their own advantage by courage and cunning. Many of these stories have endured for hundreds (if not thousands) of years; they must be getting\n      something right. Adults are often scared of frightening their children, but watch a child \u2013 they like to be a little frightened, so long as it ends up all right.\n\n4. Remember that it is good for children to be bored sometimes. Children who are not continually provided with stimuli develop more active imaginations, a stronger sense of\n      self-sufficiency and, probably, higher self-esteem.\n\n5. Delay as long as possible giving them their own mobile phone. If there is a practical need on specific occasions, or they are doing something that makes you anxious, then\n      lend them one.\n\n6. Never use isolation (\u2018go to your room\u2019) as a punishment. They will not be in a mood to use their solitude positively and they will associate being alone with\n      being bad and unhappy. Instead, if you are able to provide them with space of their own, offer them \u2018time out\u2019 as a reward.\n\n7. Only interrupt a child engaged in a solitary activity (reading, solitary hobbies, loafing about outside) if you have a clear and specific reason which you can articulate.\n      (\u2018You have to come in now because it is supper time\u2019 vs \u2018Darling, are you all right out there alone?\u2019)\n\nOur children are not happy. I believe this is because over the last half century we have increasingly monitored, supervised and attended to them, and pampered their supposedly\n  frail egos. The original motivation for this was deeply benign, but the sorry fact is that it is not working. We have an increasing number of children with diagnosable mental health issues (10 per\n  cent of children between one and sixteen is suffering from a diagnosable mental \u2018disorder\u2019 at any given time); we have too many children with pathetically short attention spans; we have\n  profoundly alienated youths, who seem to have remarkably poor judgement and serious issues with personal risk assessment, who do not trust adults and do not choose to engage with them. In 2007, a\n  report from UNICEF ranked the UK bottom in childhood wellbeing compared to other industrialized nations. In 2009, a survey of 16-to-25-year-olds by the Prince\u2019s Trust found 1 in 10 believed that \u2018life was not worth living\u2019.\n\nWoods are a very good place to practise elementary solitude.\n\nThese figures are terribly sad. We are doing something wrong. I am not, of course, suggesting that more solitude for young people would solve all these serious, and indeed tragic, problems\n  instantly, but given the known, beneficial effects of solitude already discussed in this book it might be worth giving them a chance to try it. For me, two important issues are that solitude in\n  childhood appears to be an almost universal experience of creative people and that children love being frightened in a generally safe context (that is why fairgrounds remain in business).\n\nChildren, like grown-ups, need different amounts of direct stimulus, company, social engagement and time alone. Neither you nor they can know which sort of person they are if they cannot ever\n  try out solitude.",

      "content": "#### 8. Respect Difference\n\nBernard Shaw once said, \u2018Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you; they may have very different tastes.\u2019\n\nHow much solitude does a person need? There is no real answer to this, because everyone is different. There is a helpful vocabulary for anyone trying to think this through, although recently it\n  has got clogged up a bit \u2013 the language of Introversion and Extroversion.\n\nBased on Carl Jung\u2019s 1921 definition of personality \u2018traits\u2019, a whole system of analysis has developed around the question of how much solitude people want or need. The\n  suggestion (and there are various \u2018explanatory\u2019 theories, ranging from cortical stimulation to childhood expectation and experience) is that there are two distinct types of people, who\n  process stimulation differently. For example, in one set of defining qualities you have statements like:\n\nExtroverts are \u2018action\u2019 oriented, while introverts are \u2018thought\u2019 oriented.\n\nExtroverts seek \u2018breadth\u2019 of knowledge and influence, while introverts seek \u2018depth\u2019 of knowledge and influence.\n\nExtroverts prefer more \u2018frequent\u2019 interaction, while introverts prefer more \u2018substantial\u2019 interaction.\n\nExtroverts recharge their energy by spending time with people, while introverts recharge their energy by spending time alone.\n\nUnfortunately it has proven extremely difficult to create a satisfactory way of testing who is which in any very useful way. This is partly because most people do not have a\n  single consistent style of responding, but are more introverted or extroverted in different contexts or moods, and partly because it has proved nearly impossible to find a testing method which is\n  not heavily culturally biased. \u2018Do you enjoy going to parties?\u2019 is based on the Western assumption that there are parties of a particular type to go to, whereas in some countries\n  gathering in groups may not perform the social function of \u2018parties\u2019 at all. (For example, going to church, a social gathering that is enjoyable to most of the participants, and often\n  noisy with singing and dancing, may well be a \u2018party\u2019 for some individuals or cultures and not for others.)\n\nSo some psychologists have claimed that happiness is a matter of possessing three traits: self-esteem, optimism and extroversion, and that studies prove that extroverts are happier than\n  introverts. However, these findings have been questioned, because the \u2018happiness prompts\u2019 given to the studies\u2019 subjects, such as \u2018I like to be with others\u2019 and\n  \u2018I\u2019m fun to be with\u2019, only measure happiness among extroverts!\n\nFurthermore, even if extroversion makes people happier, this might be because Western Europeans, and especially Americans, live in an \u2018extroverted society\u2019 that rewards extrovert\n  behaviours and rejects introversion. Extroverted societies have been described as validating a \u2018culture of personality\u2019, whereas other cultures are \u2018cultures of character\u2019\n  where people are valued for their \u2018inner selves and their moral rectitude\u2019. These cultures, such as in Central Europe or Japan, prize introversion. And it transpires that in such\n  cultures introverts report greater happiness than extroverts! This is not as twisted as it looks: it makes people feel happy to be approved of.\n\nThere are two social tendencies which further complicate this: the first is the apparent irresistible desire to move these sorts of words from adjectives to nouns. So someone with strongly\n  introverted inclinations becomes \u2018an introvert\u2019. This divides and separates people from each other and traps people in boxes. (\u2018She is a blonde\u2019, \u2018he is a\n  homosexual\u2019 and \u2018they are disabled\u2019 are other examples where a single characteristic comes to define the person; they may all be true, but they do not describe the fullness and\n  complexity of most individuals.)\n\nThe other social tendency that goes with this is the universal difficulty we all have with difference itself: the principle of \u2018different but equal\u2019 is almost impossible for people\n  to maintain without effort \u2013 once you have created this sort of binary system, almost everyone instinctively gives higher value to one or other of the \u2018differences\u2019, usually the\n  one with which they most comfortably associate themselves. There is a nice example of an American church leader urging congregations to appoint pastors who scored high on extroversion tests because\n  \u2018of course Jesus was an extrovert\u2019.\n\nSadly, then, although the idea that introversion and extroversion are both normal variants of behaviour ought to help us accept ourselves and understand others, it does not always have this\n  effect.\n\nMoreover we should not really need a complicated psychological test-kit to say something so simple. Individuals are different \u2013 and we value difference and individuality rather highly in\n  our present society. We would very properly resent government policies designed to make us all exactly the same, insisting for example that we all wore identical uniforms or listened to the same\n  music. It is reasonable and normal then that people should like different amounts of solitude. Even those people who never want any at all should respect those who do \u2013 and vice versa \u2013\n  and indeed, as fellow human beings, try to understand why and appreciate the different values that ought to enrich us as a society. It is interesting, but beyond my brief, to wonder why this is so\n  hard: all of us want to be treated as complex and unique human beings, but simultaneously want everyone to be just like ourselves.\n\nUsed carefully and discriminatingly, avoiding the temptation to absolutize the sets of behaviours, and understanding the limits of the terms, I do find thinking about these psychological\n  \u2018tags\u2019 can be useful. If nothing else, the words can be used to open up conversations about how much solitude, quiet and social withdrawal different individuals need: \u2018Do you\n  think of yourself as more extroverted or introverted?\u2019 is quite simply a more interesting and less-rude question than \u2018Why are you single?\u2019 or \u2018Why are you so\n  antisocial?\u2019\n\nAnd asking people why they like being alone or what they get out of it (and of course listening to their answers) is one very effective way of learning about being alone and enjoying it.",

I am going to turn to the positive claims that have been made for being\n  alone and see if I can persuade you that they are worth pursuing.\n\nOver the centuries during which people have explicitly practised solitude and reflected on their experience (that is, as long as we have had any form of recorded human culture) there have been\n  surprisingly consistent reports of what it might offer those who seek it out. These \u2018rewards\u2019 can be grouped into five categories, although they overlap and are certainly not\n  exclusive:\n\n1. A deeper consciousness of oneself.\n\n2. A deeper attunement to nature.\n\n3. A deeper relationship with the transcendent (the numinous, the divine, the spiritual).\n\n4. Increased creativity.\n\n5. An increased sense of freedom.\n\nWhat seems to me most worth noticing is how widespread, through both time and social arrangements, these experiences are. They are not some mad aberrations of a single, or even\n  a few, heroic or crazed individuals. Very different people, alone for very different reasons and using very wide-ranging images and languages, all say fundamentally similar things. Going by their\n  example, you might try seeking these rewards of solitude yourself.",

      "tags": "solitude, self-discovery, renewal, peace, emptiness",
      "content": "#### 1. Consciousness of the Self\n\nIn his excellent and informative book From the Holy Mountain (Flamingo, 1998), William Dalrymple tells a delightful and revealing little story. Dalrymple was staying\n  with a Coptic monk in the Egyptian desert, and he questioned the hermit about his motivation for choosing such an austere lifestyle.\n\n\u2018Many people think we come to the desert to punish ourselves, because it is hot and dry and difficult to live in,\u2019 said Father Dioscuros. \u2018But it\u2019s\n      not true. We come because we love it here.\u2019\n\n\u2018What is there to love about the desert?\u2019\n\n\u2018We love the peace . . . You can pray anywhere. After all, God is everywhere, so you can find him everywhere. But in the desert, in the pure clean atmosphere, in the silence \u2013\n      there you can find yourself.\u2019\n\nExactly what this \u2018self\u2019 might be remains, of course, the continuing philosophical (and psychological and spiritual and intellectual) question. If the self\n  is just \u2018me\u2019, how can \u2018I\u2019 lose it \u2013 or for that matter find it? Nonetheless, over and over again people write of solitude that it allows them to\n  \u2018re-gather\u2019 a sense of self that can get \u2018scattered\u2019. Oliver Morgan, quoting from Koch\u2019s Solitude (see Homework for details), uses the image explicitly:\n\nI can sense that my \u2018person\u2019 is pulling back from its scattering into the details and plans of today, like a wave rolling from sand and shore back to its ocean\n      source \u2013 collecting itself into a unity of \u2018ocean\u2019. \u2018I\u2019 am here, present to myself and available for a possible revelation of what is inside me . . . I am present\n      too for experiences of those guiding, inner images (personal metaphors, archetypes) that I sense shape my values, actions, judgements and decisions during the rest of the time.\n\nThomas Merton, from a religious angle, sees this process as morally necessary:\n\nAll men need enough solitude in their lives to enable the deep inner voice of their own true self to be heard at least occasionally. When that inner voice is not heard,\n      when he cannot attain to the spiritual peace which comes from being perfectly at one with his true self, his life is always miserable and exhausting . . . If a man is constantly exiled from his\n      own home, locked out of his own solitude, he ceases to be a true person.\n\nBut you do not need to be so grandiose about this business of knowing the self; it is not just a truth for reflective philosophers or great minds. It can be quite domestic and\n  ordinary. Here my friend Jill Langford describes what joy solitude gives her and how she goes about getting it in a very busy life:\n\nAbout twenty-five years into my marriage, with seven children, I asked my husband for a one-man tent for Christmas. A little taken aback, perhaps, he nonetheless granted my request and bought me a super little army tent or bivouac shell that you honestly couldn\u2019t squeeze two people into. You erect\n      it, quite easily and quickly, crawl in on your belly, then turn over onto your back, clutching a sleeping bag, raise your knees and wriggle your legs, then bottom, then torso into it. Et\n      voil\u00e0. You stay in that position till morning, then you do the same in reverse. There is no room to sit up and you\u2019d be a fool not to have a wee before retiring, since the whole\n      procedure is well-nigh impossible in the middle of the night.\n\nI use this little tent just whenever I feel the need to take off, alone, for whatever reason. For me, it works like a battery charger when I feel weighed down by the burdens of living in\n      community and am dragging my feet. Actually I don\u2019t use it very much, but knowing it\u2019s there to use if I want to is sometimes enough in itself to bring a spring back into my\n      step.\n\nWhen I do need to use it, I find it best to have a car handy, since there is nowhere to store any kit inside the tent and in my part of Scotland it\u2019s usually raining. The car is good\n      because it gets you far from home quickly, so no one will come tramping across the fields to find you until you are done with being alone. This usually takes two full days, but a single night\n      would be better than nothing.\n\nThe first morning, emerging from your bivouac-thing, there is a great sense of joy and freedom. You feel quite alone in the world and no one knows who you are or why you are there. You could\n      be in a campsite surrounded by happy families or out in the wild woods with silent, dumb creatures that creep and crawl. It makes no difference, the point is that you are alone because you\n      wanted it this way. You don\u2019t talk to a soul the whole time. You just get up, brew a coffee on a camping stove and then zip up the tent and go. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go\n      either. You know that you have about twelve hours ahead of you just to yourself. So you start walking, along the coast, up a hill, by a river, down a valley, anywhere, on and on, stopping every\n      now and then for a banana and a drink (massive water bottle) and a sit.\n\nIt feels good. You find yourself skipping, no, gambolling, like a newborn lamb. In your head, details about daily life swiftly give way to songs, hymns you used to know, praise, yes praise,\n      for God\u2019s mind-blowing creation. Your thoughts then turn to God because there aren\u2019t any people about and you find yourself chatting amicably with Him. Sometimes there are tears,\n      sobbing even, but this comes with emptying. It\u2019s really all about emptying. And then, renewal. This is what we miss if we don\u2019t empty stuff.\n\nBy nightfall, the little tent and sleeping bag beckon: you greet them both joyfully and shut down. Usually it\u2019s freezing and sleep comes in patches, but the night time wakefulness is\n      all part of it. You use it to set things straight, mentally.\n\nAnother day ahead, more wanderings, then hunger sets in and you head for home, refreshed.\n\nThis sort of experience, this kind of rediscovery of one\u2019s own self and its unique delights, just on its own seems a good reason for experimenting with a little solitude:\n  if nothing else, it is a great deal cheaper than a therapist!",

      "content": "#### 2. Attunement to Nature\n\nI love this word \u2018attunement\u2019 to describe a widely shared sense that there is something crucial about solitude in relation to an engagement with nature. It is not\n  my word, but Philip Koch\u2019s, in his book Solitude, where he explores this attunement and breaks it down into three different components:\n\n1. Clear, undistracted, sensitized perception.\n\n2. Symbolic perception: perceiving nature as signifying or symbolizing other things.\n\n3. Fusion/interfusion: the loss of the sense of barriers between oneself and nature, the sense of flowing out into it as it simultaneously flows through oneself.\n\nWhen I wrote A Book of Silence I came up with an almost identical list, except that I saw them as effects of silence rather than solitude. But I have come to think\n  that Koch may be right; nature is seldom, if ever, really silent.\n\nThe first of Koch\u2019s list is, in a sense, fairly obvious. Nature is reclusive or \u2018shy\u2019; if you want to see, you have to pay careful attention and you have to go quietly \u2013\n  and both these things are much easier to do alone. I have found that even having a dog as a companion means that I see less \u2013 the birds fly away and my attention is less focused. You are more\n  likely to perceive clearly if you are undistracted. Being alone is known to intensify all physical sensation. But there is something more to it. A great many people find they agree with Henry\n  Thoreau that \u2018it appears to be a law that you cannot have a deep sympathy with both man and nature. Those qualities that bring you near to the one estrange you from the other . . . The mind\n  that perceives clearly any natural beauty is in that instant withdrawn from human society.\u2019\n\nThe business of finding meaning, or metaphor and symbol, in nature seems an almost atavistic reaction. The gods of our ancestors were, on the whole, gods of the wild places; very small children\n  can be entertained for hours finding images in the shapes of clouds, and the poet Wordsworth writes tragically of his character Peter Bell:\n\nA primrose by a river\u2019s brim\n\nA yellow primrose was to him,\n\nAnd it was nothing more.\n\nIt is less immediately clear why being alone so powerfully enhances this capacity \u2013 perhaps because there is no one to express a different symbolism, to challenge your\n  meanings with theirs, so that the effect of your meaning can sink deeper into the mind.\n\nThe experience of fusion with, or into, nature is, when it happens, one of the highest joys of solitude. In A Book of Silence I describe one such episode on the Isle of Skye:\n\nI climbed up the steep-sided corrie. It was sheltered there and magnificent \u2013 almost vertical mountains on both sides \u2013 a mixture of shining rock and loose scree,\n    and below, tiny stands of water that looked like handfuls of shiny coins tossed casually down. It was so huge. And so wild and so empty and so free . . . And then quite suddenly and unexpectedly,\n    I slipped a gear or something like that. There was not me and the landscape, but a kind of oneness: a connection as though my skin had been blown off. More than that \u2013 as though the\n    molecules and atoms I am made of reunited themselves with the molecules and atoms that the rest of the world is made of. I felt absolutely connected to everything. It was very brief but it was a\n    total moment.\n\nOver and over again individuals report these extraordinary, mystical experiences when they are alone in nature. It never seems to happen if you are with anyone else, perhaps\n  because we all have a deep inhibition against exposing ourselves so nakedly to another, even a beloved other.",

      "content": "#### 3. Relationship with the Transcendent\n\nFor me personally, the transcendent is God. It is the desire for an ever more intimate relationship with God that drives my own desire to be alone, and many of the great\n  solitude-seekers have had a similar passion. It was this that led the early Christian hermits out of their cities and into the enormous solitude of the desert; and later drove the Irish hermits to\n  seek out tiny islands across dangerous seas, like Columba of Iona. But the search for solitude is not confined to Christianity. From the earliest traditions, Buddhists, who do not identify a\n  \u2018God\u2019 in the Western sense, have nonetheless \u2013 more than anyone else, perhaps \u2013 used solitude and silence as a vehicle of transcendence, and have evolved a massive\n  \u2018how-to manual\u2019 to support that practice.\n\nIn fact there is no major (and I do not know of any minor) religious or spiritual tradition that does not recognize solitude as a part of the necessary practice for revelation, intimacy and\n  knowledge. This would suggest that those who desire an experience of the transcendent might look to a range of these well-worked traditions to see what they are up to, and how to achieve that\n  experience of transcendence. But the state of joyful consciousness beyond the limits of the personal, the framework of the ego, does not require a religious framework.\n\nIt would appear that a period of being alone is a prelude to initiation of many kinds. We know that Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad all spent periods in solitude before launching their\n  religious missions. We know that what the Tibetan Buddhist nun Tenzin Palmo has called the \u2018pressure cooker\u2019 of solitude and retreat is normally (though there are exceptions) a\n  necessary precursor to intense religious experiences, especially those we usually called \u2018mystical\u2019.\n\nIn many societies throughout the world a period of solitude is seen as a necessary part of such ritual initiation, and especially for rites of passage \u2013 those ceremonies which mark the\n  transitions from one social status to another. Many Aboriginal youths, for example, are sent out into the desert, alone, for up to six months in some cases, to fend for themselves, before they can\n  be deemed to be adults. Other societies arrange other kinds of seclusion for these crucial times of transition. For example, the Takuna of the north-west Amazon see the time when a young woman\n  starts to menstruate as being particularly perilous; they have created a complex ritual, the Festa das Mocas Novas (the Feast of the New Women), which both protects and celebrates the\n  event.\n\nThis ritual happens when a girl first menstruates; for somewhere between four and twelve weeks, she lives alone in a little room specially built inside the family home, which represents the\n  underworld, where she is hidden from dangerous demons called the Noo. As the rite reaches its climax guests arrive wearing masks to impersonate the Noo and the girl is painted with black dye. She\n  remains in the chamber and after three more days, under the protection of her family, she is led out to a celebration and dances all night, until dawn. She is then given a flaming brand by a shaman\n  to throw at the Noo; their demonic power is broken and the girl is deemed to be an adult woman.\n\nIn mediaeval Europe both religious people (monks and nuns) and men about to become knights passed the night preceding their initiation in a \u2018vigil\u2019, awake but alone in preparation\n  for their initiations.\n\nThese sorts of experience are not by any means limited to religious contexts, although socially recognized rituals probably make it easier to access the emotional states of transcendence.\n  Bernard Moitessier, the single-handed yachtsman mentioned in Part III, seems to have loved being alone at sea mainly because it brought on these experiences of intense unitive awareness of\n  transcendence. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge used to stand on the very edge of cliffs to provoke vertigo, which gave him a direct sensation of the transcendent (this is not a method I would\n  advocate). John Muir, the pioneer early conservationist and inspiration behind the National Parks movement, describes poising himself on the very edge of an enormous waterfall in order to feel its\n  power and glory. For him this clearly went beyond the \u2018attunement to nature\u2019 I discussed in the previous chapter, and opened a way into mystical experience very close to religious\n  ecstasy.\n\nBecause rites of passage are found in almost all societies, and take such an extraordinary variety of forms \u2013 not all of them necessarily including solitude or exclusion from the group\n  \u2013 it is difficult to generalize about what is going on or why this is so crucial to the human psyche. But this sense of meeting or encounter between transcendent powers and the individual,\n  alone, in liminal space, is so pervasive that it is hard not to trust to such universal wisdom.\n\nJohn Pettie\u2019s \u2018The Vigil\u2019: A squire prepares himself for life as a knight on the eve of his knighting ceremony.",

      "content": "#### 4. Creativity\n\n\u2018Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school for genius,\u2019 wrote Edward Gibbon.\n\nOf all the claimed rewards of being alone, this is perhaps the easiest to \u2018get\u2019. It seems rather obvious that great art, great original thinking, any creative work, needs to be done\n  in some degree of solitude. What is more, all the creators tell us so \u2013 from Franz Kafka to William Wordsworth; from Werner Heisenberg to Beatrix Potter; from Georgia O\u2019Keefe to Ludwig\n  Wittgenstein (just to take a tiny range). It seems a universal truth, and it mirrors our own smaller experimental performances. But actually it is slightly odd, because, as Anthony Storr puts it,\n  \u2018Art is communication . . . explicitly or implicitly the work which [is produced] in solitude is aimed at somebody.\u2019\n\nWe seldom inspect this paradox, because the reality is so self-evident. Kafka wrote to his fianc\u00e9e:\n\nYou say you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess, that utmost of\n    self-revelation and surrender . . . that is why one can never be alone enough when one writes . . . why even night is not night enough.\n\n(You may not be very surprised to learn that, shortly after this, they broke off the engagement!)\n\nThe poet Rainer Maria Rilke advised a younger poet,\n\nWhat is needed is . . . a vast inner loneliness. To walk in one\u2019s self and to meet no one for hours on end. That is what one must be able to attain . . . looking out\n    from the depths of one\u2019s own world from the expanse of one\u2019s own aloneness which is itself work and rank and profession.\n\nIn A Room of One\u2019s Own, Virginia Woolf argues very convincingly that the reason there were so few great women writers is that it was so difficult for them to be\n  alone: a writer needed a room of her own and enough money to occupy it. Women were not lacking in talent, intelligence, energy or imagination \u2013 they were lacking in solitude, in the chance to\n  be alone for long enough to be creative. Later Woolf goes on to try and work out why solitude mattered so much to creativity. She suggests that every woman is haunted by a sort of inner ghost,\n  which she calls \u2018the angel in the house\u2019 (after a Victorian poem of that name by Coventry Patmore extolling his wife as the ideal woman). Woolf describes the perfect woman as\n\nintensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed daily. If there was a chicken,\n    she took the leg; if there was a draught she sat in it . . . Above all, she was pure.\n\nEmily Dickinson: Great original thinking, any creative work, needs to be done in some degree of solitude.\n\nThis angel-ghost prevented a woman from doing anything so assertive and \u2018aggressive\u2019 as truly creative work. But Woolf goes on to suggest that this\n  \u2018angel\u2019 was a social construct (in the interests of husbands, fathers and men more generally) and an imaginative projection. In order to \u2018kill the angel\u2019, which Woolf\n  considered both necessary and difficult, you had to get away from all the people who were projecting, were constructing the would-be writer, not as writer but as an \u2018intensely\n  sympathetic\u2019, \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018unselfish\u2019 woman. To get away from them all you had to be alone.\n\nAt first sight this might seem to apply only to women \u2013 and certainly the \u2018angel in the house\u2019 is a peculiarly female problem \u2013 but I think that perhaps everyone, even\n  the notably introverted Kafka, is haunted by an inner ghost who undermines creativity by implying that there are better things to do with your time, asking sarcastically who you think you are and\n  preaching modesty and humility and \u2018unselfishness\u2019, or the social duty to get rich, help other people and be a good team-player or other social obligations. If these are really social\n  constructs which we have internalized they tie very neatly into our society\u2019s negative views about solitude: the two reinforce each other.\n\nIt is difficult to create any solid theory about the human imagination, how it is triggered into action of any kind, and what might be done to develop and strengthen it. But anecdotally, and in\n  almost all biographies of creative artists and scientists, periods alone seem to be crucial.\n\nWerner Heisenberg wrestled for some years with the theoretical question of how to model the atom to take into account the mathematical problems which seemed to distort all the data. He talked at\n  length with his friends and other experts; they seemed to get nowhere and he was intensely frustrated. And then in 1925 he had the \u2018good luck\u2019 to suffer a violent attack of hay fever;\n  to recover from this he went off on his own to Heligoland (an island in the North Sea, famous for its absence of pollen). And there he was alone. And alone he came up, very quickly, with his Theory\n  of Imprecision (now normally called the Uncertainty Principle). It was a profoundly creative piece of physics, and it challenged and inspired many of the people whom he had been talking to\n  beforehand. It opened the door for one of the most creative few years that modern physics has ever known: Quantum Mechanics sprang into existence because of Heisenberg\u2019s hay fever and the\n  solitude it imposed on him.\n\nIf you feel any identification with Heisenberg\u2019s frustrations, in any creative area, you do not need to have a major allergic reaction; you can just go off on your own and see if it helps.\n  Solitude is a well-established \u2018school for genius\u2019, and the outpouring of creativity is one of its promised joys. In learning to be solitary and happy with it, you can prepare yourself\n  for this sort of creativity.",

      "content": "#### 5. Freedom\n\nWe value \u2018freedom\u2019 very highly in our society. Perhaps for the first time in history we speak of it as an absolute and unalienable right for every human being.\n  Sometimes I think we see it as so obviously a good and necessary quality of life that we do not examine what we mean by it.\n\nBut it is not really that simple. In the first place freedom has two dimensions: there is \u2018freedom from\u2019 \u2013 from things you dislike, that bind or limit you (poverty, pain or\n  fear, for example). And there is \u2018freedom to\u2019, which is, I think, the more important, the more joyful and the more enriching. It seems that the American Declaration of Independence was\n  trying to draw this distinction between the two when it separated \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018the pursuit of happiness\u2019.\n\nAnd it is this second dimension of freedom which has been associated with solitude \u2013 first to work out what you desire to be free to do, and then to imagine and create the doing of it. In\n  The Stations of Solitude, the philosopher Alice Koller defined freedom as \u2018Not only having no restraints, but also being self-governing according to laws of your own choosing . . .\n  where your choices spring from a genuine sense of what your life is and can become.\u2019 In this short passage she moves from \u2018no restraints\u2019 (freedom from) to being\n  \u2018self-governing\u2019 (freedom to). In order to achieve this second sort of freedom she suggests that you need a \u2018genuine sense of what your life is and can become\u2019. That is to\n  say, you need a consciousness of yourself, and we have already seen how solitude enhances and develops that self-awareness which is the first step towards being self-governing.\n\nBut it goes further than this. There is a very real sense in which the presence of other people limits our personal freedom. At the very crudest level most of us do not feel \u2018free\u2019\n  to pick our noses or fart in company. A little further up the social scale, even in these libertarian times, many places of business still require workers to wear a uniform and most have an\n  implicit, if not an explicit, \u2018dress code\u2019. Even party invitations suggest what you might want to wear \u2013 and most people find this helpful, even though it is of course a\n  restriction. Even if you decide not to abide by the advice, your complete freedom to dress as you choose will have been compromised. On the whole, people in a group feel most comfortable when they\n  are, broadly speaking, conforming to the behaviour of that group. When my ex-husband and I separated, our houses very quickly diverged in decor \u2013 while we lived together I did not feel\n  consciously inhibited, but the first room I decorated in my own, single-person, household was a colour I would not even have thought of before. We did not fight about the colour of the walls, but I\n  learned (and judging by his present house, he also learned) to pre-compromise when we came to make those kinds of choices. Now I know I like jewel-bright colours to live with. Being with each\n  other, in this small and not very important way, restricted our personal freedoms. It is inevitable, and in any good relationship an acceptable price to pay, but we should not disguise from\n  ourselves that there is a price.\n\nBecause there is another more profound sense in which being alone strengthens personal freedom. Assuming that you are a reasonably nice person, who finds it easier to feel happy and confident\n  when those around you \u2013 and especially those you love \u2013 are happy, then some of your energy and imagination is bound to be (and should be) engaged in their happiness as well as your\n  own. R. D. Laing, the radical psychiatrist, wrote a little monologue to show the way in which love itself \u2013 desiring the good of the beloved other \u2013 can make personal choice and freedom\n  extremely complex. Here the \u2018speaker\u2019 (a fictional voice) wants to be happy but sees that those around her are not:\n\nThey are not having fun.\n\nI can\u2019t have fun if they don\u2019t.\n\nIf I can\u2019t get them to have fun, then I can\u2019t have fun with them.\n\nGetting them to have fun is not fun. It is hard work.\n\nI might get fun out of finding out why they\u2019re not having fun.\n\nI am not supposed to get fun out of working out why they\u2019re not.\n\nIn fact this sense of knowing yourself alone and nakedly, so to speak, may be one part of why solitude inspires creativity \u2013 because creating something yourself, of your\n  own, uniquely, requires a kind of personal freedom, a lack of inhibition, a capacity not to glance over your shoulder at the opinions of others.\n\nNonetheless, it is oddly the case that life with others seems to work more smoothly when individuals do know what they want, even if they are prepared to compromise it for the greater collective\n  enjoyment. Nothing is more destructive of warm relations than the person who endlessly \u2018doesn\u2019t mind\u2019. They do not seem to be a full individual if they have nothing of their own\n  to \u2018bring to the table\u2019, so to speak. This suggests that even those who know that they are best and most fully themselves in relationships (of whatever kind), need a capacity to be\n  alone, and probably at least some occasions to use that ability. If you know who you are and know that you are relating to others because you want to, rather than because you are trapped (unfree),\n  in desperate need and greed, because you fear you will not exist without someone to affirm that fact, then you are free. Some solitude can in fact create better relationships, because they will be\n  freer ones.\n\nHere is Alice Koller again, summing up these points:\n\nBeing solitary is being alone well: being alone luxuriously immersed in doings of your own choice, aware of the fullness of your own presence rather than of the absence of\n      others. Because solitude is an achievement.",

      "content": "## I. Introduction\n\nThere are two important theoretical books about being alone: rather annoyingly they are both called Solitude. One is by Anthony Storr (Flamingo, 1988) and looks\n  psychoanalytically at solitude, loneliness and creativity, and concludes there are other routes to fulfilment and psychic well-being than intimate relationships; creative work may satisfactorily\n  replace these. (The book was originally titled \u2018School for Genius\u2019.) The other is by Philip Koch and is subtitled \u2018a Philosophical Encounter\u2019 (Open Court Publishing Co.,\n  1994). Both are deeply affirmative and helpful.\n\nPerhaps the most famous book about being alone is by Henry Thoreau. Thoreau (1817\u20131862) was a nineteenth-century American author, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax-resister,\n  surveyor, historian and leading transcendentalist. In 1856 he published Walden, which is an account of the two years he spent living alone in a hut in a wood near Concord in Massachusetts.\n  It has become a major classic, and together with Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018The Prelude\u2019 \u2013 and much easier to read \u2013 it is the great book linking solitude and nature.\n\nIsabel Colegate has written a lovely history of hermits called A Pelican in the Wilderness (Harper Collins, 2002). She defines \u2018hermits\u2019 in non-religious terms, but most of\n  her subjects take a fairly extreme path of solitude. Peter France\u2019s Hermits: insights of solitude (Chatto & Windus, 1996) is more focused on prayer and spirituality, but is\n  beautifully written and illuminating about what people have gained from being alone through the centuries.\n\nRichard Byrd (1888\u20131957) was a US admiral, early aviation adventurer and explorer. His book Alone (Shearwater Books, 2003; originally published 1938) describes his time alone in\n  Antarctica. This expedition was not altogether successful: a faulty stove leaked carbon monoxide into his hut and he became seriously ill. The attempts to rescue him take up a good deal of the\n  book. However, before he got sick he wrote some of the most beautiful prose about the beauty and solitude he found there. It is an inspiring read.\n\nThe figures from the 2011 Census for the UK have now been published by the Office of National Statistics in various forms, both online and print. They make a fascinating background to many\n  discussions, including those contained in this book. Here is a pie chart showing the numerical size of households:\n\nNotice how large the segment of single-person households is. It is not odd to live alone. Pin this graph up somewhere visible and if you find the idea of \u2018being\n  alone\u2019 alarming, look at it and take comfort from the knowledge that you will not be alone in being alone!\n\nQuakers (more formally called the Society of Friends) are a religious denomination founded in the seventeenth century. They are famous for their commitment to pacifism, their refusal to take\n  oaths, their radical stand on a wide variety of issues, their complete lack of a leadership structure and their \u2018meetings for worship\u2019, which are predominantly silent. There will be a\n  Quaker Meeting near you, and if you are uncertain whether it is silence or solitude you are most in search of, you might well find some clues by attending one. You will be made welcome and not\n  pressured to \u2018join\u2019.\n\nTrappists are an order of Roman Catholic monks who live under a \u2018reformed\u2019 version of the Rule of St Benedict, which incorporates a great deal of silence. The monks communicate in a\n  form of simplified sign language. Thomas Merton (1915\u20131968) was a Trappist and The Seven Storey Mountain (published in the UK as Elected Silence, Hollis & Carter, 1949)\n  describes the life of the monks. There are no Trappist monasteries in the UK, but there are various contemplative (more or less silent) orders, especially of women, and it is possible to visit many\n  of them. Making a private visit, often called a \u2018retreat\u2019, is a very safe and structured way to experience being on your own, although surrounded by experts and well looked after. Most\n  such communities welcome visitors; you do not have to be a Christian and will not be required to attend services. There is a comprehensive list of retreats available at www.retreats.org.uk.\n\nMy own A Book of Silence is published by Granta. Although, as I say, it is more about silence than about solitude per se, it is more or less impossible to write about one without\n  writing about the other and it contains very full references to a great many books and individuals who have practised the two together.",

His most recent book, The Posthumous Affair, was published by Tupelo Press in 2012. He teaches creative writing at Liverpool John Moores\n  University. He lives alone.\n\nIn the third and fourth centuries thousands of Christians went off to be hermits in the desert \u2013 mainly in the Egyptian desert, but also in Sinai, in what is now Syria and in Jordan. It\n  was perhaps the first large-scale experiment in being alone that we have any record of. These hermits are often called the Desert Fathers, although some of them were women. They were quite\n  experimental \u2013 trying out a variety of forms of prayer, ways of supporting themselves, ascetic disciplines and lifestyles. They had enormous influence on subsequent Christianity, because\n  monasticism, as it developed in the West, was based on their practices. As they were much admired by their contemporaries, their stories and reflections were collected in several different books.\n  Anyone worried about solitude and sanity should read some of these \u2018sayings\u2019, as they are called. The most admired of these hermits tend to be gentle, generous, humble, kind and\n  slightly self-mocking. There are many translations of these originals.

How We Got Here\n\nFor the detailed history of the later period of Rome there is the famous (and enormous) The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon\n  (published in six volumes between 1776 and 1781). He was perhaps the first serious historian to blame the fall of Rome on Christianity, which he thought made Romans \u2018effeminate\u2019.\n\nA more contemporary approach to the specific issues I have been looking at can be found in the works of Professor Peter Brown (of Princeton), who has specialized in the religious culture of the\n  later Roman Empire and early mediaeval Europe. He writes in a way that is wonderfully accessible as well as scholarly. Among his relevant books are: Augustine of Hippo: A Biography\n  (University of California Press, 1967); The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity (Columbia University Press, 1988) and most recently Through the\n  Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350\u2013550 AD (Princeton University Press, 2012).\n\nThe Eagle of the Ninth Chronicles (OUP, 2010) is a trilogy of children\u2019s novels by Rosemary Sutcliff, set in Roman Britain. The third of the series \u2013 The Lantern\n  Bearers \u2013 is an extremely moving account of the resistance to the Saxon invaders after Rome pulled the legions out of Britain to defend the imperial city itself. It addresses the\n  conflict of values and the sense of devastation and cultural unhinging \u2013 on all sides \u2013 as the Empire declined and broke up.\n\nIn Britain at least thirty-six of our present towns and cities, including London, have Roman foundations. Visits to the Roman Baths in Bath (hence the city\u2019s name) and the Amphitheatre in\n  Chester both offer a powerful impression of the high value of public and civic life even at the furthest ends of the Empire. A trip that takes in both Hadrian\u2019s Wall (and its associated\n  artefacts) and Lindisfarne (the Holy Island) or the Farne Isles, where St Cuthbert (c. 634\u2013687) had his hermitage, shows the contrast between the two ideals very sharply (while also providing\n  some beautiful empty terrain for solitary walking).\n\nThe Romantic movement in Britain is best known through its poets: William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats are perhaps the key names.\n  Wordsworth was the most articulate about the value of solitude and its crucial importance to artists. It is a central and continuing theme of his work. For him solitude in nature was essential to\n  creative inspiration. He has had immeasurable influence on the poetic ideal ever since. His poetry is still widely read and accessible. He is especially associated with the Lake District\n  (Cumbria).",

This is partly because household\n  maintenance is something that not only can be, but often is, done alone. If you are trying to find time for solitude you may already have it if you stop seeing vacuuming as a disagreeable task and\n  see it instead as a period of peaceful solitude; since it has a clear purpose and a definite point of completion, it may even turn out to be a very easy and unscary way of being alone.",

      "content": "## 6. Going Solo\n\nIf you do not know anyone you can ask directly about solo adventures, there is a wonderful range of books. Here are my top ten (although I have left out some favourites because\n  I have already described them elsewhere in this book). Some are novels.\n\nThe Long Way by Bernard Moitessier (Doubleday, 1971). Moitessier was in many ways a natural \u2018loner\u2019, without any pejorative connotations. He was a French single-handed\n  yachtsman and this book is an account of his non-stop solo circumnavigation. When he set out, it was as part of the first Golden Globe Race (which Robin Knox-Johnston won), at which point such a\n  journey had never been accomplished, or even attempted. However, after about two-thirds of the journey, Moitessier decided that he did not want to win the race or even go back to Europe at all, so\n  instead he just sailed on, completing another half-circuit until he reached Tahiti. The book is a lyrical, even mystical, account of the journey and the joys of solitude. It is worth noting that\n  Moitessier was a very experienced and highly skilled sailor, and also a professional writer.\n\nRobinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, 1719. This is fiction. It is also one of the great adventure stories of English literature, and is a profound meditation on solitude and both its\n  positive and negative aspects. Of course, in the end Man Friday turns up and Crusoe is no longer alone. If you have only read one of the versions created for children you will be surprised.\n\nWalden; or, Life in the Woods by Henry Thoreau, 1854. Henry Thoreau was an American radical thinker \u2013 with some fairly eccentric views on a number of subjects. He went to live\n  alone in a tiny hut in a wood not far from Concord for two years, and wrote this major US classic about it. It is a joyful, rambling book, full of rich description, odd thoughts about life, a\n  philosophy of freedom and a wonderful sardonic commentary on his contemporaries. It may well have inspired the whole movement towards confessional autobiography, and was also a forerunner of the\n  ecology movement. If it does not lead you at the very least to be tempted to try a small taste of solitude, I can only feel sorry for you.\n\nSea Room by Adam Nicolson (Harper Collins, 2002). Nicolson\u2019s father gave him three tiny islands off the west coast of Scotland called the Shiants. Here Nicolson traces their\n  history and their ecology and the patterns of extraordinary and lonely lives lived on them. Although no one is actually \u2018alone\u2019 for very long, the islands themselves are so isolated and\n  far away \u2013 not just in space but in atmosphere \u2013 that their very existence is somehow an adventure into solitude. Nicolson is a loving biographer and historian, and himself a visitor.\n  Lovely and encouraging and hopeful.\n\nWalking Home by Simon Armitage (Faber & Faber, 2012). The poet Simon Armitage walked the Pennine Way alone in 2010, and this is the account of his journey. It is not an\n  \u2018adventure\u2019 in the sense that some of the other books are \u2013 although he made it more challenging by travelling as a troubadour, singing for his supper in pubs and other places en\n  route. But it is a glorious, thoughtful, touching book about some of the pleasures of solitude and the beauties of hill walking.\n\nA Woman in the Polar Night by Christiane Ritter (trans. Jane Degras) (Allen & Unwin, 1954). It probably is not very useful to include this book, because it is very hard to get hold\n  of \u2013 but there are so few adventure stories by women, and she writes so extraordinarily well about polar solitude, that I am including it anyway.\n\nRogue Male by Geoffrey Household (1939, new edition, Orion, 2013). This classic thriller takes solitude to a new level. It is a great adventure story and an extraordinary meditation on\n  solitude, freedom and survival. It is very exciting.\n\nThe High Lonesome: Epic Solo Climbing Stories, ed. John Long (Falcon Press, 1999). I don\u2019t get it myself, not really; solo rock climbing and mountaineering scare rather than\n  excite me. I first read this to try and understand. Nonetheless Long has collected some thrilling and thoughtful accounts from a range of individuals who do enjoy this high and giddy solitude and\n  are reflective enough to try and explain why.\n\nThe Places in Between by Rory Stewart (Picador, 2004). Stewart walked across Afghanistan, alone, just after the Taliban had fallen. His book is an extraordinary mixture of politics,\n  exploration, travel description and human endurance. It has an odd, rather endearing nineteenth-century feel about it \u2013 minimizing discomfort and danger, slightly self-mocking \u2013 and\n  introduces a faithful hound. But he writes beautifully about places most of us will never go to. A real adventure.\n\nA Voyage for Madmen by Peter Nichols (Profile, 2001). Nichols\u2019s book gives a full account of all nine entrants to the 1968\u201369 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. There\n  were nine entrants, and only one finished. It provides a genuinely thrilling study of a range of different responses to extreme solitude. Sadly there were no women entrants.\n\nThere are of course many other stories of lone rangers \u2013 by air and sea, in exotic places and nearer home. After you have read some you should be at least be willing to imagine a small\n  adventure into solitude yourself.",

      "content": "## 7. Train the Children\n\nI have already discussed Anthony Storr\u2019s book Solitude. I particularly like the way he sees children as tough, as natural survivors, capable of turning even\n  quite dark experiences into creative and nourishing channels. Richard Louv\u2019s book Last Child in the Woods (Atlantic, 2009) is an impassioned plea for children to be allowed more\n  experience of solitude, particularly outside in wilder places. The book is annoyingly American in some ways (there is rather a lot of pop-psychology), but his evidence is thoroughly marshalled and\n  the \u2018child\u2019 he describes seems to be much more realistic and attractive than the hyper-delicate, endangered, brittle child of too many child experts\u2019 fantasies. Like me, he sees\n  many of the problems that children are currently suffering as related to their lack of solitude \u2013 and he uses sociological and psychological research to prove the case; he is particularly\n  persuasive on ADD (attention deficit disorder). Tim Gill, in No Fear (Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2007), takes a similar line in a more European context. It is on these books and\n  others that I base my opinion that a lack of solitude \u2013 and especially solitude out of doors \u2013 is one cause of our children\u2019s problems.\n\nBoth Philip Pullman and Jack Zipes have published modern translations of the Grimm Brothers\u2019 collected fairy stories. I find these better for children than modern retellings, where too\n  often the fear of being alone (along with any parental shortcomings) is written out to \u2018protect\u2019 the child.\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak, a picture book for very young children, is one of the best starting places for this sort of literature. It manages to be both funny and\n  serious, the pictures are fabulous and the \u2018hero\u2019 victorious through his own courage.",

My difficulty with most of these books is that they completely\n  accept the totalizing binary division, but simply favour the opposite side: \u2018it is entirely wonderful to be an introvert and you are somehow superior to the extroverts\u2019. The\n  Myers\u2013Briggs Personality tests, which make introversion and extroversion a key division, and social dependence on them, has reinforced this oppositional approach.

      "content": "## Introduction\n\nThis is a book about failing: messing up, disappointing others, letting ourselves down and ruining our lives. It\u2019s a book that is intended to be read at desperate moments: when we can\u2019t stop crying, when all our hopes have been dashed and when we are too ashamed of ourselves to reach out for help.\n\nFirst and foremost, this book hopes to act as a friend; one who accompanies us in the darkest hours and proffers one or two helpful remarks that momentarily cheer us up \u2013 or at the very least, stop us from feeling so alone. We\u2019ll meander from this topic to that and explore failure from many angles, but essentially we\u2019ll simply be repeating \u2018I know, I know \u2026\u2019 in a tone of wholehearted sympathy and boundless compassion.\n\nIt matters that the authors of this volume have themselves known huge failure (abandonment, infamy, panic, chaos). This is far from a dry, academic exercise or psychological treatise. It\u2019s a letter written by one set of desperate humans to another. It has its origins in despair and in a slow recovery from catastrophe. We\u2019ll leave the dispassionate textbooks to others.\n\nGiven how much suffering and tragedy there is at large, it\u2019s striking how few books seem to have been written to comfort us in our hell. An aura of artistic detachment still surrounds so many of the ones that do exist, as if entertainment and enlightenment were the only priorities and disaster chiefly happens to other people. The books may be about divorce, unemployment, disgrace, death, exile, ridicule, opprobrium and mental collapse, they may make us sigh and weep, but it is somehow assumed that the reader will not themselves go through something resembling what has been described on the page. They will watch the central character be jeered and spat at, the heroine flee the country, the hero exchange their family home for a hut \u2013 and then check the front door is locked, slip into a warm, clean bed and turn out the light in anticipation of a calm tomorrow.\n\nOf course, the closer we get to true, lived tragedy, the harder it is for words to have any useful impact. What can be said to a person who has just lost their livelihood, who has witnessed a loved one die, who is contemplating professional ruin or who will never be able to set foot in their home town again? The challenge is so large, the psyche so ruined, that they might simply prefer silence, which could honour the disaster better than vain arguments.\n\nBut there must be a way in which words can be put to use, even now. There is plenty of time to read during crises: many empty hours in the middle of the night on a cancer ward, in an empty marital bed, in a prison cell before the trial or in a little house after a scandal. This book aspires to be read in lonely hotel rooms and on the platforms of deserted railway stations. Its intended audience are those who bewail their fate, who wish they had never been born, who are going out of their minds with worry and who can barely remember a day when they were last not in agony.\n\nSometimes, at such moments, we might fall upon the Bible. Copies are often left in the bedside tables of hotels. There is certainly comfort within them; from the ancient cadences, the references to distant tribes, the characters who begat X and Y ... The New Testament can be especially tender; it is \u2013 after all \u2013 one of the great tragedies of world history and filled with love and hope. The man from Nazareth certainly understood suffering. And yet, for so many of us, the book ultimately doesn\u2019t work, because we cannot believe in the beatific solutions being proffered. We are in biblical agony, yet godless. We are Job without even someone to question.\n\nThe modern world has not served us well. We have been so busy inventing gadgets to save us time and ease minor frictions, and we are so keen on anticipating a more perfect technological future, that we\u2019ve overlooked the fact that life continues to provide us all with an endless array of tragic plots, which we cannot even appeal to divine forces to assist us with. This is where this book attempts to fit in. It wants to be the resource that we turn to when everything is as bad as it has ever been.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at two kinds of engagement with failure over the following pages, in their own ways equally harrowing: what we might call actual failure and imagined failure. By actual failure, we mean every scenario in which a life is destroyed by our own errors and the swerves of fate: bankruptcy, social ruin, romantic disaster, disgrace \u2026 These are explorations and considerations for those who have been severed from loved ones, those who have been arrested or are waiting to be so, those who are in prison, those who have lost all their money, those who will from now on always be pariahs and will never be able to step into \u2018polite society\u2019 again. We\u2019ll then look at imagined failure, for those who are ostensibly untouched but are in agony within, for their hell is in their minds. They are in a prison of their own psychological construction, terrified of failure \u2013 not just slightly worried, but unable to sleep, haunted by an apprehension of disaster, mesmerised by spectres of ruin and mockery and brought to the edge of suicide by panic about disgrace and shame.\n\nIn both cases, the aim is to find our way towards ideas that will make it possible to go on. We won\u2019t deliver happiness, as such, but we are interested in endurance \u2013 in managing to point the way to an existence where, despite everything, we can keep going, and where there are even occasional small pleasures. A life in which we will be able to smile again, where there might be a little love and laughter \u2013 even if, right now, what beckons is seemingly lifelong lamentation.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that this is also, along the way, a book about resilience, because if we can survive failure \u2013 if we can find a way through the obstacle course \u2013 we will never need to be afraid of very much again. True freedom comes from the knowledge that we can get through the worst that life throws at us. We can fail profoundly and still find things, in a way, bearable.\n\nOscar Wilde, one of the most famous failures of all time, has much to teach us about ruin. At the beginning of Wilde\u2019s sentence for gross indecency in 1895, when he was in Wandsworth Prison, he was desperate for reading matter. He managed to have smuggled in for him a Bible, some Plato, Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, St Augustine\u2019s Confessions and works by Walter Pater and Cardinal Newman. It\u2019s an intriguing list, and begs the question of what might help someone in prison who is contemplating the destruction of everything they know, who has lost the right to see their children, who has been spat at on the platform at Clapham Common station and who has received hundreds of letters from the public declaring them the most awful person who ever lived. That is an interesting challenge for any book; it sets the bar at an admirable height.\n\nWe\u2019re taught so much about how to succeed. All the energy and inventiveness of our time is focused there. No one wishes to speak about the less likely, but far more important, possibility that we will witness the destruction of our careful plans. We need a lot of help with failure; we can\u2019t allow it to have its victory over us without trying to fight it off with the most vigorous ideas. We\u2019re often taught to be suspicious of self-help, and it\u2019s true that it has its vainglorious aspects when applied to the questions of how to flatten one\u2019s stomach or make a fortune. But self-help fulfils its true promise when we are being helped to find a way out of despair.",

      "content": "## The Many Types of Failure\n\nOne of the many cruel aspects of failure is that when it strikes, it can feel like the most unusual and particular event. \u2018Why did it happen to me?\u2019 we wonder, \u2018Why have I been singled out?\u2019 Our failure looks to us like a monstrous exception in an area of life dominated by success \u2013 a quite spectacularly strange and rare affliction. We\u2019ve not only failed, we are \u2013 it appears \u2013 almost completely alone in having done so. Everyone else\u2019s marriage is stable, even terrific; all around us, there are lovers going out on dates and wedding anniversaries being celebrated. Most people\u2019s jobs are continuing without trouble; it\u2019s hardly \u2018normal\u2019 to be at a loose end at what should be the height of our career. There\u2019s no evidence that the others around us have lost command of their reason. The name of no one else we went to school with produces search results that render ordinary social life impossible. How have other people managed not to mess up as badly as we have? We might be indoors, crying and hitting the walls or biting our hands, but outside, children are going to playgrounds, birds are singing, suited figures are attending purposeful meetings, families are laughing, youngsters are planning fifty years of success, shopkeepers are wishing their customers a good day and there will be parties to attend at the weekend. We feel like freakish, pitiable outcasts in a world of triumph, friendship, ease and contentment.\n\nIt is this extremely painful impression that deserves to be corrected at once. Failure may seem like the exception when it is being experienced \u2013 when we are in a profound crisis \u2013 but let there be no misunderstanding: messing up is what humans do and have been doing since the start of our adventure on the planet. Our own, personal failures stand in a prestigious and quasi-essential lineage. We are not alone; we may even be in the majority.\n\nWe don\u2019t live through our failures all at once, which is where some of the misapprehension and loneliness comes from, and we don\u2019t necessarily do it visibly, which is another reason why we\u2019re fooled that everyone else is fine, but taken together, humans are both the masters and forced subjects of failure. There is no family in the land without a serious disaster in their midst. Look at a classroom of twenty sweet 5-year-olds; within half a century, a good third of them will have been scarred by a very sharp knife indeed. It would be possible to tell the story of humanity not \u2013 as we usually do \u2013 as one of progress and gradual mastery, but as one of repeated distress, unshakeable madness and eternal regret. Almost no life goes to plan and few of us come through unscathed \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly questionable whether all our beautiful machines and complicated accomplishments have made us one jot less troubled than our animal-skin-clad foraging ancestors.\n\nIt\u2019s this sombre reality that can make us feel such a sense of relief when we see a painting such as Pieter Bruegel\u2019s The Triumph of Death (see overleaf). Here is a skeleton army marching over a forlorn landscape, butchering everyone in sight. No one gets away. Kings are breathing their last, lovers are being murdered and funeral pyres are burning in the distance. Corpses are swinging from scaffolds, a horse is dragging a cartload of bodies and massed ranks of soldiers of the armies of death are waiting to join the scene of butchery. This is not a representation of any one particular war zone or scene of horror, but it feels familiar because it is existentially correct, true to some basic facts of our own lives and of all peoples: life is endemically connected with cruelty, ruin and disaster.\n\nThis may be a horrific fact to take on board, but it is even more horrific to mistakenly believe that the agony might be ours alone \u2013 or that we have been promised anything else. What we are going through only looks rare. Our pain only seems exceptional and aberrant because we are looking at false, wilfully edited \u2013 and hence cruelly sentimental \u2013 pictures of reality.\n\nLet us consider some of the leading categories of failure that compulsively visit the human animal.\n\nPieter Bruegel the Elder, The Triumph of Death, c. 1562\u20131563",

      "content": "### Romantic failure\n\nAstonishingly, we are still inclined to trust that relationships might somehow be the fun, sweet, exciting and endearing bit of life. Let\u2019s be clear: there is no faster route to destroying ourselves than through love and sex. There is no more effective way of turning otherwise sensible and balanced lives into tragedies than through engagement with our romantic and sexual drives.\n\nNo wonder people are nervous on first dates \u2013 they should be a lot more so (especially if the date goes \u2018well\u2019). The chances of getting through our sex lives unscathed are negligible. No one properly informs us of the risks. There are no warning signs, extensive training programmes, hazard lights and alarms. We don\u2019t employ masked figures to wail and intone when adolescence begins. It\u2019s like the mouth of an active volcano left without guard rails. There is nothing like the requisite solemnity or fear. Yet so much predisposes us to fail.\n\nFor one, we have a hopelessly fragile understanding of our own minds and needs. We can\u2019t grasp what we\u2019re after and what we should resist. Sex is in permanent conflict with emotional priorities. It\u2019s impossible for us to recognise the ways in which our underlying disturbances affect who we can desire \u2013 and what unfortunate and reckless choices we continually make due to the imprint of our childhood psyches. It can take a decade to work out that we have landed on a person exquisitely designed to provoke our worst responses. For a while, we may get away with it. No one gets seriously hurt \u2013 there aren\u2019t any children, there\u2019s no money involved, no one else cares. But our luck will only hold out for so long. Gradually, we assemble the ingredients for our own disaster: a slightly compromised marriage, a somewhat damaged psyche, a handful of children, a sprig of boredom, an ounce of jealousy, maybe an affair, some financial wranglings, a divorce, a judgemental society \u2026 In the end, we don\u2019t need to do very much wrong in the romantic field to end up involved in horror.",

      "content": "### Workplace failure\n\nFor the first two highly influential decades of our lives, we are required to work a lot without ever really needing to ask ourselves any of the bigger questions about what this work means: whether the work is right for us or helps us to make a contribution we welcome or can identify with. We just put our heads down and make our way through the educational obstacle course as best we can. But once we graduate, we are thrown off guard. Without warning, the options become more perilous \u2013 even as the silence about how to choose from them grows. We want, naturally, to make a comfortable living, but most of us will feel we have failed if our work doesn\u2019t at the same time provide us with a feeling of deep satisfaction and meaning. Too often, we confront a choice: between head and heart, between what we ideally want to do and what it would be sensible to settle for. Immediately, the ingredients for failure start to brew. There are those who overestimate their talents, and end up in middle age, broke and disappointed, envious and angry. There are those who underestimate the pull of authentic ambition, and end up materially comfortable, but dissatisfied, ashamed of their cowardice and longing to make changes they cannot afford. We are strung between the pull of safety on the one hand and of fulfilment on the other, each one with a viable claim on us, neither providing us with enough on its own, and with the world rarely willing to offer us both. We need to be very fortunate not to regret having been either excessively weak-willed or excessively foolhardy.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that we are called upon to make the most important choices without the relevant experience needed and without properly understanding ourselves or the conditions of the job market. With little awareness of the seriousness of what we are doing, we accept a position \u2018for a year or two\u2019, only to find two decades later that this shunted us onto a track that we have never been able to escape. We don\u2019t sense doors closing; we don\u2019t even know where the doors are. There seem to be few people with the relevant experience and patience to talk to. Instead, we wind up sitting at home on Sunday evenings, quietly panicked about the years passing, sensing that something large is not right about our direction but without the courage or resources to know what to do next.\n\nEven if we have had the good fortune to know what our ideal destiny would be, we need to be very lucky indeed for the economy not to trample on our hopes. In almost every field we might consider, there are far more candidates than there are positions. The world is not waiting for yet another author or psychotherapist, furniture designer or anthropologist. Success requires a rare combination of talent and stubborn grit and relentlessness. We may fail not because we lack vision or talent, but because our hearts are too tender.\n\nThere is something structural to our misfortune, too: the capitalist marketplace requires that a good portion of its participants fall by the wayside every year. Weaker companies and participants must be eradicated; obstacles to lower prices and efficiency must be removed. Progress demands culls. Customers can only be satisfied if the weaker producers are identified, exposed and winnowed out. The anxiety of our age isn\u2019t simply an unfortunate aberration: it is the leading emotion that should logically accompany us into the office.\n\nFurther risks abound in the dynamics between workers. There are bullying managers, uncooperative colleagues, undermining subordinates. There is jealousy, backbiting, gossip and persecution. The very quality that we need in our work \u2013 ambition \u2013 may be what alienates us from other, more lackadaisical workers who won\u2019t lose an opportunity to bring us down when they can. The workforce pyramid has very steep sides and the tumbles are brutal and terminal. We will need an implausible degree of luck not to be stabbed in the back, or at least roughed up in the corridors of power.",

      "content": "### Reputational failure\n\nUntil it is under threat, it is easy to overlook what \u2018reputation\u2019 is or how desperately it matters. Reputation is made up of all the material that people who hardly know us resort to when judging us. It is the repository of all the random, semiconscious associations, prejudices and scarcely examined ideas that surround our names. The material may be inaccurate and casually compiled, but reputation still ends up determining the gospel truth about who we are for people who never have, and never will, give us an honest minute\u2019s thought \u2013 that is, for almost everyone in the world. The other thing to note about reputation: it cannot be cleansed once it has been sullied.\n\nFor a long time in our lives, most of us lack a reputation of any kind. Our name is simply a blank. No one knows whether they should be pleased or appalled to meet us; the internet is silent about our identities. This is a momentous freedom \u2013 though it is rarely appreciated as such. Then, because of some superhuman moves on our part (unceasing efforts at work, remorseless networking, desperate attempts to generate publicity), we may start to develop a \u2018good\u2019 reputation. Positive associations begin to hover around our names; strangers may want to meet us. Our social circle becomes filled with people who like us chiefly because they are under the impression that other people like us.\n\nUntil one day we make a mistake \u2013 perhaps not a very large one, all things considered. We sleep with the wrong person, we send the wrong email, we lose our temper in the wrong place, we say the wrong thing online \u2013 and our reputation, carefully built up over three decades, falls apart in two hours. Like death (which it in many ways resembles), reputational extinction can happen in an instant. There are articles in the newspaper, rumours about us at parties \u2013 there may even be jeers in the street. Legions of people we didn\u2019t even realise existed but who turn out to have been deeply offended by our success now gang up to accuse us of crimes way beyond those we actually committed. We are expelled from the group and sent into status exile.\n\nWe want \u2013 and may even begin \u2013 to protest. We try to put people right. Maybe we send letters pointing out that they have not judged us correctly; that they have got a few facts wrong here and there. We patiently try to explain that they haven\u2019t fully grasped the way things look through our eyes. We might launch a court case in a bullish attempt to persuade them of another side to the story \u2013 or we might make a grovelling apology, give some money to a good cause, and hope for a second chance.\n\nBut we will soon realise that our efforts are entirely in vain. People aren\u2019t getting us wrong for sensible reasons. They are generally doing it on purpose, to appease some historic sense of grievance, to assuage the pain of having themselves been overlooked for too long or to have a bit of fun because their own lives are filled with boredom, suffering and humiliation. Or they may hold on to the prevailing ideas about us because they can\u2019t be bothered to do anything else; it\u2019s just easier. They probably never thought seriously about us until now \u2013 and they\u2019re not, in the middle of a scandal or a sacking, about to start to reflect deeply on our true character and the injustices of fate. They believed public opinion when we were supposedly marvellous, and they are happy to continue blithely to believe in it now that we are apparently unspeakable. It saves time.\n\nReputation is not something that can ever be \u2018repaired\u2019 because it is never properly built; it is merely a temporary assembly of wind and twigs. Yet public shaming is about as serious a wound as anyone can suffer. We are social creatures, hard-wired to care immeasurably about what others think of us; our antennae are perfectly attuned to notice how we are being perceived and when we have fallen foul of the community. We can\u2019t help but be pained that \u2013 however complex and mitigating our true story is \u2013 we are condemned, for the rest of our lives, to be known only as \u2018the criminal\u2019, \u2018the weirdo\u2019, \u2018the loser\u2019 or \u2018the pervert\u2019.\n\nIf can feel like nothing we could ever do will be able to correct the mark on our names; we will never be able to reach into the minds of those who disparage us and alter the story that is unthinkingly summoned up whenever we are mentioned. A broken reputation forces us to do nothing less than give up on our relationship with most of the human race; it takes some practice, to say the least.",

Despite our good intentions, we may end up behaving in ways that earn us their permanent opprobrium. Perhaps we have an affair or divorce their mother or father; maybe we take a job in another city or force them to relocate to another country. Or, at a time when they were especially vulnerable, we may be visited by problems we cannot control and that we regret every day of our lives: heavy drinking or addiction to drugs, depression or anxiety, being manic or paranoid. Alternatively, we might be beholden to a rigid or na\u00efve theory of parenting or politics. Or more broadly, something might hold us back from expressing the love and care we feel deep down.\n\nSometimes, there is no way back from our errors. Despite every attempt to apologise, we are told that we are not welcome. We understand; we don\u2019t hold it against them. We know that it\u2019s not the job of a child to dig deeply into the mind of their parent or to extend empathy towards someone who should always have been there for them in uncomplicated ways. They had a right to expect regularity, predictability and kindness. They never signed up to rages, a scandal all their friends could read about online or a new family they were expected to go on holiday with. No wonder they want to keep their distance.\n\nNow, every time we see a young child playing happily with a parent in the park, we don\u2019t just see a scene of innocence and kindness, we receive another reminder of our ineptness and selfishness.

This error is one that might not have been classed as such at one time, but that grows fateful because of a change in the wider political, economic or social context we inhabit. If the times hadn\u2019t changed, we might have been safe, but, perhaps without much warning, history moves sharply and we end up on the wrong side of it. Victims of such historic failure might be aristocrats with a castle and ancestral lands before the French Revolution or industrialists with factories in the Caucasus before the Russian Revolution; they might have been those associated with the South Vietnamese government after the fall of Saigon or doctors with Western classics on their bookshelves in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nWhat was once a grey area can become \u2013 very suddenly \u2013 extremely black.

      "content": "### Mental health failure\n\nFor most of our lives, if we are lucky, our minds do roughly what we want them to. They come alive and fall asleep as we command; they go in the direction we steer them towards. They are quiet when we need to unwind, they are unimaginative when we need to concentrate and they stop repeating ideas when we have heard them sufficiently often.\n\nUntil \u2013 for some of us \u2013 our minds become our enemies. We lie in bed in the early hours and beg them to switch off, but still they continue to buzz and whirr, throwing out random worries and projects and visions as the hours turn from two to three to four \u2013 and all chances of a productive day ahead recede. Sometimes our minds get stuck on a particular loop of anxiety: they panic again and again about what might happen during a speech or a meeting, a shopping trip or dinner with a friend. Their ringing gets so loud, their worries so catastrophic, that we have to withdraw from an active life. We reassure them as best we can and still they insist on hysteria. The most minor challenges grow unbearable. We fear that everything is about to come to an end, we see terror everywhere, we have to check and recheck every point of concern \u2013 and yet the counsel and wisdom we take in can never stick. Or, afflicted in a different way, we might grow sad and heavy for reasons that our minds refuse to yield: we don\u2019t quite know what is unbearable, only that it is so, and that we are wretched and undeserving, and that nothing we do can be good enough \u2013 that we would be better off dead.\n\nFew among us who have avoided such torments can take them seriously; they so easily seem like malingering \u2013 or pure hallucination. Those who mention them must be exaggerating. But the sad reality is that our minds are no less prone to malfunctioning than other organs of our bodies, and in no less dreadful ways. They can be instruments of torture. When our minds break down, we find ourselves unable to work, go out in public, approach any challenge with confidence, act as a responsible parent or build new relationships. We live in paranoia about disgrace and shame \u2013 we don\u2019t trust ourselves not to say something shocking or to harm ourselves or someone we care for. We fail in these instances not because of anything that has happened in the world, but because the minds through which we perceive it have turned against us.\n\n* * *\n\nUltimately, we are prone to failure because we are tragic animals; creatures whose constitution is inherently unsuited to the complicated tasks thrown up by our long and multifaceted lives. We fail in our ability to read the world with the perspicacity and intelligence required. We don\u2019t notice until it is much too late where we have missed clues, where we have been hasty or arrogant, where we have been incautious or conceited. Our minds are not powerful enough, and not well-trained enough, to take on board all the lessons we would need to stay cautious and safe across all the demands we face. We blunder into scenarios assuming we know how to handle them. We worry too much in some areas and not nearly enough in others. We celebrate too soon. We grow proud of ourselves and dare to assume that we know how to live \u2013 hubristically believing that we are not at the mercy of what we might as well call \u2013 with zero religious intent \u2013 the gods. And all the while, our lives dangle on a thread, vulnerable to governments, religions, ideologies, businesses, families and our own fragile neurochemistry.\n\nIn the 4th century, the Christian scholar and monk Evagrius the Solitary \u2013 who spent most of his life in a hut in the Egyptian desert \u2013 defined seven \u2018evil tendencies\u2019 that needed to be overcome in order to lead a godly life. From his list emerged medieval Christendom\u2019s resonant concept of the seven deadly sins: lust, pride, greed, wrath, envy, gluttony and sloth. We can imagine these operating beneath most of our disasters \u2013 of all the kinds listed above \u2013 even today. Christian writers put this dilemma grandly and poetically: we sin not by chance, but because we are the descendants of sinners; all of us are tainted by Adam and Eve\u2019s \u2018original sin\u2019 (what St Augustine termed peccatum originale). It isn\u2019t in our power to insulate ourselves wholly from the worst sides of our nature \u2013 man is a faultily designed, congenitally sinning animal.\n\nWe may try to be sexually sensible, for example, but the temptations are many and often unheralded. All that tragedy requires is a frustrated marriage and a night away. The ingredients that might have made for banter, an indulgent smile and an unremarkable acknowledgement of appetite when we were single can concoct \u2013 once there are legal strictures in place \u2013 combustible material for a scandal from which no recovery is possible. We need only have a slightly too intense desire to hold and to be held, to caress, to touch, to lay a hand \u2013 and we are doomed. The tripwires are everywhere, artfully hidden: across barriers of age, workplace regulations and internet addresses.\n\nWe don\u2019t notice ourselves wanting far too much: admiration, money, acclaim. It happens \u2013 as it tends to with sins \u2013 slowly and imperceptibly. But the more it grips us, the more we lose our ability to spot our errors. We cut corners, make unnecessary enemies and are impatient and careless \u2013 we gradually tie the noose around our own necks.\n\nWhen we are proud, we stop noticing the ways in which we humiliate others; we forget to regularly remind ourselves of how flawed and absurd we are. We start to take ourselves very seriously \u2013 and we build up a store of anger in those around us. Every success we chalk up has quietly hurt someone else, and for a long time, they can\u2019t protest, because we can dominate and crush them with our power. But we have enemies, there is blood in the water \u2013 and when we make a mistake, they will be ready to turn it into an irreparable wound.\n\nWe might not think of ourselves as \u2018lazy\u2019, either, but the word doesn\u2019t have to be restricted to those who sleep in past midday and don\u2019t do the housework. There are deeper kinds of laziness: the intellectual laziness that stops us from examining our own natures; the moral laziness that stops us exhibiting kindness; the professional laziness that prevents us from seeing that we are engaged in ultimately noxious pursuits that are harming those around us.\n\nIt sounds old-fashioned to warn anyone of such sins \u2013 the word even sounds a little charming or comedic. But sins are nothing of the sort: they are the broken paving stones on which we can trip and shatter our lives. The point isn\u2019t really to warn at all \u2013 it\u2019s too late for that. Simply, to recognise these pitfalls is to provide a little perspective to the reasons why we fail. We should remember that our errors take their place within a more than 2,000-year history of messing up.\n\nTo speak in more psychological language, our brains are cognitively, congenitally flawed. They don\u2019t give us the information necessary to succeed in our goals \u2013 we don\u2019t have the right dials on our instrument panel and the warning lights largely don\u2019t function. It is appallingly easy to ruin, or at least heavily dent, our lives \u2013 and as no one really tells us how not to, most of us at some point will. We should not \u2013 on top of it all \u2013 ever feel alone with our catastrophes.",

It can seem as if only the severely unwell would ever seriously contemplate, let alone carry out, such a desperate act.\n\nHowever, we do ourselves and our lives a serious injustice through evasiveness. We should accept suicide as the real possibility it is \u2013 or else it will return as a compulsion in moments of particular despair. The question of existing or not existing deserves dignified and slow examination. People will turn to suicide whether or not the matter is taboo; there can be no risk of incitement through discussion alone, but at least when we have the courage to examine the act rationally, we can develop a better handle on the central intellectual arguments for remaining on the side of life \u2013 rather than aligning with it only out of shame, habit, convention or cowardice. A good life requires that we wrestle sincerely with the possibility that we might end it prematurely. Living should be a choice, not a command \u2013 and, especially in the wake of serious failure, we need to choose with our eyes open. If we are properly to respect life, we should never be squeamish about dallying for a while \u2013 a long and thoughtful while \u2013 with the notion that we do not have to be here.\n\nTo liberate our thinking, we might start by looking back to the Stoic thinkers of ancient Greece and Rome, among them Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes. In different ways, these philosophers put forward the view that choosing our own end could be a realistic possibility that a self-possessed and intelligent person might opt for after a great deal of reflection, not just a momentary aberration or evidence of mental illness. Exceptionally in the history of the West, the Stoics held that there was nothing inherently shocking or forbidden about ending one\u2019s own life. It was, in their eyes, the birthright of every noble and free spirit to choose how long they wished to be here.\n\nFor the Stoics, contentment \u2013 or as they put it in Latin, dignitas \u2013 must be founded on a life in which our bodies and minds leave us free of terrible pain, in which outer circumstances do not continually humiliate us and in which mistakes or \u2018tragic errors\u2019 (the Stoics were keen observers of Greek tragedy) do not bring eternal opprobrium and shame upon us.\n\nThe Stoics knew we were in danger, however. Our capacity to ensure a pain-free life endowed with dignitas is vulnerable to many forces not wholly within our command: we have little say in the condition of our bodies and brains, the minds of others can quickly fill with unbudgeable prejudices about us and we have passions and tendencies to foolishness that mean we may well unwittingly do something that falls foul of our community\u2019s moral code. The term that the Stoics used to capture this vast, uncontrollable inner and outer terrain was \u2018fortune\u2019. And, as they insisted, key elements of what we require to lead a decent life lie in the realm of fickle and cruel fortune.\n\nThe essential objective of Stoic philosophy is to help us reach a position where we are not held hostage or intimidated by fortune\u2019s possible whims and vagaries. When we worry, it is common to be told that our dreadful fear won\u2019t turn into a reality. But what if it does? We might, in the dark hours, throw out a comment to ourselves that, as soon as we\u2019ve uttered it, sounds both completely alien and very soothing: \u2018If things were to get really bad, truly bad \u2013 more than I would want to bear \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have to go on forever.\u2019\n\nThis middle-of-the-night thought is also likely to sound grotesque, outlawed and embarrassing, because we are all \u2013 even atheists \u2013 the heirs of 2,000 years of emphasis on the sanctity of every life, and of a faith in a benevolent God who assures each one of us of His love right now and His peace in eternity. But the Stoics made it their starting point. Consider this letter Seneca wrote to a friend, sometime around AD 60:\n\nThe wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can \u2026 He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are numerous events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he sets himself free. And this privilege is his, not only when the crisis is upon him, but as soon as Fortune seems to be maltreating him; then he looks about carefully and sees whether he ought, or ought not, to end his life on that account. He holds that it makes no difference to him whether his taking-off be natural or self-inflicted, whether it comes later or earlier. He does not regard it with fear, as if it were a great loss; for no man can lose very much when but a driblet remains. It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. And dying well means escape from the danger of living ill.\n\nSeneca was not advocating random or thoughtless exits; he was attempting to give us more courage in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always within our power, when we have genuinely tried everything and rationally had enough, to choose a noble path out of our troubles. He was seeking to strip willed death of its associations with pathology and to render it instead an option that the wise always know is there as a backstop. It doesn\u2019t need to be a grim spectre, either; the Stoics emphasised that death could be a moment to celebrate what had gone well in a life, to thank friends and to appreciate the beautiful and good sides of the world. The idea was to see death as a door through which we knew we had the right and the capacity to walk when it felt necessary. Seneca continued:\n\nYou can find men who have gone so far as to profess wisdom and yet maintain that one should not offer violence to one\u2019s own life, and hold it accursed for a man to be the means of his own destruction; we should wait, say they, for the end decreed by nature. But one who says this does not see that he is shutting off the path to freedom. The best thing which eternal law ever ordained was that it allowed to us one entrance into life, but many exits. Must I await the cruelty either of disease or of man, when I can depart through the midst of torture, and shake off my troubles? This is the one reason why we cannot complain of life; it keeps no one against his will. Humanity is well situated, because no man is unhappy except by his own fault. Live, if you so desire; if not, you may return to the place whence you came \u2026 If you would pierce your heart, a gaping wound is not necessary \u2013 a lancet will open the way to that great freedom, and tranquillity can be purchased at the cost of a pin-prick.\n\nThese ideas sound so alien to us because of the long Christian past that succeeded pagan philosophy \u2013 and that deemed suicide a sin greater than murder and a direct offence against God, because it involved killing not only the body but also the soul. Many of us continue to hold on to the Christian views of the end of life even while we don\u2019t actually believe in their underlying rationale \u2013 and indeed, when we are far closer to the pagans in our pitiless and harsh exposure to fortune. That is precisely why, in order to cope with the anxieties fortune causes us, we should permit ourselves to learn more about a stiffer, franker philosophy than our own. Some of the Stoic philosophers were among the most intelligent, kindly, wise and gentle people who have ever lived. However strange and unfamiliar some of their views may sound, we would do well to extend sympathy to why they held them \u2013 and what relief they would have found in them on their most challenging days.\n\nThat said, our claim is that there remain three central reasons why suicide is not \u2013 after all \u2013 to be advised. We can list them systematically.",

      "content": "### Firstly: Others\n\nThe most common emotion that drives us to think of ending our lives after failure is that we have \u2018nothing left to live for\u2019. As we contemplate the ruin of our career, the disapproval of friends, the mess of our marriage or the degeneration of our body, we conclude (often very understandably) that there are no plausible reasons to endure. It is at this point that we should try to call to mind something that, especially in these circumstances, can be very hard to hold on to: that there are others \u2013 many others \u2013 who are relying on us to keep living so that they can remain sane and safe, or indeed themselves continue to live. We may not be able to see these people, and if we do meet them, they may not tell us of their reliance, but the reality is that, were we to take our own life, they would find it more or less impossible ever to return to normality. They would forever take our death as an indictment against them: they would feel that they had not been able to help us as they desperately wished \u2013 and they would imagine that our death was a sign that they had not mattered enough to us and that they were therefore neither sufficiently loveable nor adequately worthy. These assumptions might not be remotely true, but it is almost certain that the people who love us would take them to be so in the days, years and decades after our demise. For a select few, our death will be something they simply never get over, and they will feel permanently abandoned. We may not see these people very much, and they may well have been angry or disappointed with us when we last encountered them, but the underlying truth is that their sanity depends on our restraint. There are probably half a dozen or so people on this list directly known to us, and another handful offstage that we might not remember too well, or never even have met, but in whose minds we are nevertheless a potent force (the brother of a friend, perhaps, or a parent of someone we were at school with). And needless to say, on this list are likely the most significant figures of all: our own parents, partners or children \u2013 whose existence must be an incontestable, non-negotiable, incontrovertible call to keep going, whatever personal horrors we are travelling through.\n\nWhen we are muffled by despair and loss, it can seem implausible that someone as wretched as us could ever matter to another human \u2013 matter critically \u2013 but we do. Immensely. Certain people in our lives right now would quite literally never be able to digest what we are thinking of doing. No day would ever be free of the shadow thrown over them by this incident. People who take their own lives are very seldom trying to deliver an insult to anyone else, they are not trying to tell their children they don\u2019t love them or their friends that they don\u2019t matter, but this is how \u2013 despite every precaution \u2013 the act is likely to feel. Furthermore, the consequences of our death will ripple in unpredictable ways through society. When one member of the tribe decides the game isn\u2019t worth it, others \u2013 ostensibly unrelated \u2013 may also despair. The news of our end, in a few lines in the local paper, may be the final encouragement needed for someone else to despair fully of their circumstances. Suicide is catching; it weakens all of our resolve to keep going.\n\nWe are evidently not offending God or the angels by taking our own life, but we are doing something far more tangible: we are causing devastating problems for the people around us.\n\nThis could feel like a dour and nihilistic philosophy: are we meant to keep going just to avoid burdening others? Is living just a socially mandated chore? It might sound dispiriting, but this idea contains a fortifying, and even releasing, message. We may indeed have nothing directly and personally left to live for, but we possess something far more important to justify our existence: the lives and happiness of other people. Living may not be our wish, but it can be something more robust: our duty.\n\nWhen in despair, let us remind ourselves that we need to continue for the sake of someone else. We can go on in the knowledge that there is meaning in others\u2019 lives \u2013 even when we can no longer (at least right now) see it in our own.",

      "content": "### Secondly: We cannot predict the future\n\nIt\u2019s a seldom-mentioned detail that to kill oneself requires a great deal of certainty. It may not seem as though the taking of one\u2019s own life would call for intellectual self-confidence or faith in one\u2019s powers of forecasting, but it implicitly does. As we prepare the tool to end ourselves forever, it is necessary that we be filled with the conviction that we will always hate ourselves, that nothing about our circumstances can ever change and that the world will never shift in any way towards something more manageable and easier to bear. To kill oneself is to claim to know the future.\n\nHowever, we should have enough experience of our minds to realise that they have not been endowed with any such infinite power. We can\u2019t even foresee how things will turn out over a day \u2013 for ourselves or for the world \u2013 let alone over three or four decades. There are so many moments in all of our lives when, at 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, we feel revolted by ourselves and our chances, only for our spirits to shift and, by 8 p.m., to have turned the corner. We are creatures who don\u2019t notice how volatile and temperamental we are. Our moods have a terrible habit of not identifying themselves as such; they claim to represent settled, robust positions when in fact they are merely clusters of temporary associations floating on a complex stream of chemicals.\n\nThe tragedy of suicide is that the act allows us one, and only one, mood to determine our entire future. It is therefore profoundly unfair to the many alternative or latent versions of who we are \u2013 the sweet self, the curious self, the loving self; unfair to all our selves to be murdered by the present, despairing incarnation of us that is right now dominating the control room of our minds.\n\nAs well as our changeable moods and emotions, we should be equally sceptical about the fixity of the world. Certain unpredictable swerves of fate may have brought us to thoughts of suicide: the swerve that created the revolution, the sexual panic, the economic crash, the request for a divorce \u2026 Something major that we hadn\u2019t ever thought possible might tip our lives into horror; a dreadful rare event that strips everything of meaning. But in our shock, we cease to notice an element of hope. If fate has swerved into disaster, it might well \u2013 with equal unpredictability and suddenness \u2013 swerve back into something more bearable. We might not be able to see how the revolution could ever end, how the moral panic might be wound back, how the economy could pick up or how a new lover might enter our lives \u2013 but our inability to see a line between our current situation and a bearable future doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t eventually be one. We could be surprised by hope just as much as we have been surprised by horror.\n\nThere is something hubristic and poignant about a claim to know how we will feel and what the world will be like over an extended period that we are in fact stripping ourselves of our ability to witness. Christians once determined that the problem of suicide lay in what they termed \u2018despair\u2019: a loss of hope in the possibility of an intervention from God. But we don\u2019t have to rely on miracles in order to hold on to the idea that the circumstances which brought us to our present anguish might over time cede to more benevolent forces. Hopeful things are as likely to happen as unhopeful ones: history might alter, new inventions and ideas could solve old forms of suffering and love might arrive without warning.\n\nWe don\u2019t control existence; we should surely have learnt this by now. We can\u2019t tell what might unfold. Though we may have experienced the negative side of fate, we shouldn\u2019t deny ourselves the chance to live through its possible positives. We don\u2019t have to know quite what good thing might happen (we\u2019re almost certainly too tired and too sad to do that anyway); only that it might do so.",

      "content": "### Thirdly: The power of the imagination\n\nOne way to frame the issue is to suggest that, very often, people kill themselves because of a failure in their powers of imagination. They simply cannot picture a better life than the agonised one they currently have; they lose the ability to conjure up images of a more bearable way to be.\n\nThis suggests the importance of giving the imagination every encouragement it needs to do its life-sustaining work \u2013 and of trying to understand its workings and optimal inputs. By imagination, what we really mean is the power to summon up alternatives. When we are suicidal, it is not possible to imagine finding another job or retraining or shifting profession. We can\u2019t imagine not minding about the gossip being spread about us or finding another partner and letting ourselves trust someone again. We can\u2019t imagine getting by in a wheelchair, living on a very modest budget or relocating to another country.\n\nIt is therefore key to assert a theoretical truth from the outset: with sufficient imagination, almost any problem can be worked around. There are substitutes for most of what we have lost; not ideal replacements, but viable ones. If one door has closed, the imagination can, in time, find another. Every life can be rendered bearable, however unpromising the initial ingredients. If 200 doors have closed, there will be a door number 201 to locate somewhere. If plan A has failed, we can eventually pull together a plan B or C \u2026 or Z. There are an infinite number of ways to lead a life \u2013 and it is simply part of our illness that we cannot, as yet, see beyond the one way of life that we loved and have lost. Like a grief-stricken, abandoned lover, we can\u2019t picture that there are alternative candidates; but just as we might meet someone new, so can we determine new ways to live.\n\nThere are other cities we can go to and completely new kinds of work we can try. There are lovers who have a completely different approach to intimacy from those we have known to date. We are grown-ups \u2013 that is, people with choices. We are not the small children we once were who had to depend on their parents for everything and were imprisoned by narrow circumstances. We can build ourselves a small hut on the edge of the desert if we want to. We can work as a carer or retrain as a psychotherapist, find employment in a prison or in a hospice. We can help staff a suicide line (we have a lot of experience in the field already) or volunteer in an emergency shelter. We can change our names. If we\u2019re feeling shy and defeated, we don\u2019t have to go out and see anyone ever again. We can live by ourselves, mind our own business, read the classics and tend to our garden. We can have a breakdown and then recover; a lot of people do. Should the mood take us, we can throw ourselves into learning a new skill or take a university degree in Sanskrit by correspondence course. We can find the love we need; we only require two friends, or even just one, to get by. Many people might be cruel, but a few are infinitely compassionate and kind and we can go out and find them and not let them go. We could make a new circle of friends among recently released convicts (they tend to be very bright and very free of social snobbery). We could go to a monastery or a nunnery or look up a few old and trusted friends and suggest living together in an unconventional, small and supportive commune. We can rid ourselves of the toxic values we grew up with and become \u2013 in the best way \u2013 outcasts and eccentrics.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to stick to the script we thought we\u2019d be following all our lives. We might have wanted to do so, but we are profoundly flexible creatures. When we arrived on the Earth, our mental wiring was loose enough that we could have developed into excellent foragers in the Kalahari Desert, Latin scholars in a university or accountants in the logistics industry. Our biology is elastic. We may have lost a little of that primordial flexibility, and it might no longer be so easy to pick up new languages or physical skills, but we remain eminently equipped to acquire new tricks. Other people \u2013 noble and interesting people \u2013 have been here before us. There have been exiled Russian princes who have learnt how to become tennis teachers; \u00e9migr\u00e9 South Vietnamese army generals who have started kindergartens; divorcees who have remarried in their eighties; shamed executives who have opened flourishing corner shops.\n\nIn order to increase our chances of survival, we need to feed and massage our imaginations; we need to provide them with examples of alternative narratives, so that they can grow more skilled at throwing out plan Bs when fate commands. We must give them books to read about countesses who found happiness with manual workers, potentates who learnt to get by on modest pensions and cities that were rebuilt after being burnt to the ground. Whatever way we happen to be living, we should constantly force ourselves to picture different, more arduous, but still bearable ways to be, imagining ourselves as pilots who are at all times wondering what alternative runway they might head to in order to land their plane in an emergency. It is worthwhile to spend time considering how we might survive without any friends, without a reputation, without health, without any love or without much money. Only a few of us will ever write short stories for a living, but very many of us will be called upon by fate to rewrite the stories of our lives. That is the true destiny and function of the imagination.\n\n* * *\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to picture other lives for ourselves and so \u2013 understandably \u2013 sometimes we feel like we want to extinguish the one we have. This book seeks to provide alternative scenarios to the ones we have relied on until now \u2013 and the strength to move towards them. Suicide is something that a desperate and depleted imagination instinctively likes to turn to, and we shouldn\u2019t be terrified if it does drift that way. The Stoics allowed their imaginations to wander a while and their lack of squeamishness at what they found is bracing. We could \u2013 of course \u2013 end it all. That will always remain the great fallback. But given what we know about the impact of such an act, we should use everything in our power not to do it. Instead, we should be provoked by the intellectual puzzle before us: how can we remain alive, when it would be so easy and so tempting to die? How else might we get by, given how many possibilities have been closed to us? How can we rebuild our futures creatively out of the ruins of our old lives?",

      "content": "## How to Deal with the Meanness of the World\n\nWe live in a world that, much of the time, gives off an appearance of kindness. People say sorry if they bump into us in the street, there\u2019s a lot of smiling and gentleness in many homes and offices, modern schools \u2013 especially for younger children \u2013 devote sincere effort to fostering respect.\n\nThis can make it all the more surprising when we discover \u2013 in the course of our failure \u2013 something that we probably suspected (but tried not to believe) from the outset: that beneath a very thin layer of civility, human beings are capable of extraordinary cruelty. We don\u2019t have to wait for a war to break out to realise this; reserves of malevolence and unkindness throb beneath the most innocent circumstances \u2013 and are drawn like iron filings to the magnet of failure.\n\nAn everyday example of this malevolence can be witnessed in the minor, but telling, arena of comment sections beneath online articles. Here, in anonymity, we encounter the true thoughts of people who might otherwise have smiled or apologised if their umbrella became entangled with ours in the street.\n\nThe world\u2019s religions have collectively spent billions of hours stressing compassion, forgiveness, generosity, meekness, love, empathy and friendship. Over centuries, they have sought to make progress with our souls. But online comments prove that all efforts at moral education and ethical evolution have made no progress whatsoever. We remain \u2013 for the most part \u2013 the unkind beasts we always were.\n\nFor example, perhaps we read an article explaining that a 30-year-old female prison officer has slept with an inmate a decade younger than she. She is married and has two small children. She has apologised profoundly for a moment of madness, but it didn\u2019t help. She was sacked and given a three-year suspended sentence \u2013 and barred from employment in most fields. Her husband left her; her father disowned her. She tried to kill herself, failed, but managed to lose an arm in the attempt. A journalist has written up the story and we scroll to the comments:\n\n\u2013 Scum.\n\n\u2013 Better luck next time.\n\n\u2013 Unfair! If it had been a man, he would have got a decade behind bars.\n\n\u2013 What a lenient sentence.\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s sickos like this who run the world.\n\nThis, in a world where people will pick up litter in parks and parents spend time teaching their children to say \u2018thank you\u2019 after someone has passed them a cup of water. Deep down, we harbour impulses that would have made Jesus and the Buddha weep and accept their work had all been in vain.\n\nTo protect ourselves against surprise when faced with such facts, we should shed our innocence once and for all. We will be fortified by accepting the grim truth at the earliest opportunity: without any cynical meaning, the truth is that other people \u2013 most other people \u2013 are simply extremely mean-spirited. Large numbers of humans (what we call \u2018society at large\u2019) are empty of love and tolerance. There may be the odd sentimental effusion here and there, but the rule is that forgiveness and generosity cannot be counted on. Kindness is the firm exception.\n\nTherefore, if and when we fail, we must be ready for nothing less than constant nastiness. It is nothing personal. We should not allow ourselves to assume otherwise, or to be led astray by the present sunny demeanour of people at the dentist\u2019s office or the flower shop. Most of our so-called friends will desert us; most strangers will uncritically repeat the worst things said about us; and if a story about us makes it into the papers, most comments written beneath it will need to be read only when we are heavily sedated or in the presence of a doctor or psychotherapist.\n\nIf we hear or read vicious statements about ourselves, it is understandable that we might lose our minds or seek to kill ourselves. We would need to be very brutish and coarse inside not to feel such temptations. How could we possibly be brought up to respond well to literature and art, to be open to experience and to be vulnerable in love \u2013 and yet somehow not take it as an affront worthy of suicide if we read that we are apparently \u2018a piece of shit\u2019, \u2018an undeserving pervert\u2019, \u2018someone everyone always hated\u2019 or \u2018a loser who should never have been born\u2019. It takes a degree of insensitivity few of us can or should lay claim to to be able to read such material and assume that life can continue to be some sort of tolerable journey.\n\nIn order to try to recover equanimity \u2013 as part of our ongoing project to resist a very understandable wish to die \u2013 we need to understand what is going on. The meanness has explanations \u2013 and the more we have a secure handle on them, the less the meanness will weigh on us. We will still mind, but we will \u2013 with luck, when we are well rested \u2013 not necessarily be so intensely driven to die.\n\nA crucial step is to recognise that no one would ever be so mean who was not, somewhere inside, extremely unhappy. It wouldn\u2019t occur to someone balanced, sane and fulfilled to spit on the defenceless online corpse of their enemy. It wouldn\u2019t satisfy anyone who had a sense of purpose, who was loved and who liked themselves, to grind a stranger (however stupid or impulsive they had been) into the dust. Keeping this firmly in our thoughts helps to restore balance in our relationship with our bullying foes. They may seem extremely strong and we may appear defenceless and at their mercy, but their despicable behaviour indicates that they must \u2013 inside \u2013 be feeling utterly abject and despondent about themselves and their prospects \u2013 for only this could explain their glee in our failure. Beneath their confident demeanour, they are wrestling with a sense of overwhelming worthlessness. All schadenfreude is, at heart, a symptom of pain, suffering and a lack of fulfilment. We can\u2019t know exactly what the other\u2019s problem is, but we can be assured that there is one. And while we may not be able to get back directly at our enemies, by a strange piece of cosmic justice we can know that something or someone has got there first; their behaviour is proof of the scale of their inner misery.\n\nThis may seem implausible initially simply because of how widespread the hatred and ill feeling directed at us appears to be. Can we really believe that this level of viciousness could be so common and yet still unjustified? Doesn\u2019t it simply indicate that settled public opinion has reasonably decided that we are awful?\n\nBefore we panic, however, we should take notice of how widespread unhappiness is \u2013 and therefore why it is entirely predictable and logical that 1,000 or even 10,000 horrible comments might be left beneath a story about us in the press, or that a large crowd should be outside the door baying for blood. This degree of meanness isn\u2019t a sign of legitimacy; it\u2019s evidence of how much misery is in circulation among human beings.\n\nThough the details will vary from case to case, grave disappointment is a constant across populations. The average person, from the moment they wake to the moment they lose consciousness, will be the victim of a stream of slights, large and small \u2013 too many almost to register and take issue with, but enough to fill underground cisterns of vengefulness and anger. Their children don\u2019t respect them. Their partner no longer admires them. They have been sidelined in their job \u2013 which they find repetitive and dispiriting anyway. Their friends are half-hearted in their enthusiasm for them. Their parents let them down. Their house is mediocre, their town in decline. None of it may sound so bad in isolation, but taken together, day after day, there is plenty here to supercharge the batteries of fury and envy.\n\nMuch of the time there will be no outlet for this rage. The afflicted person is left to slam the front door, snap at their partner, become impatient with their children or nurse dark thoughts about outsiders. But then, a story of someone else\u2019s failure pops up and for a moment there is a satisfying sense that this other person may be to blame for all the disappointments \u2013 and their annihilation promises to purify one\u2019s own circumstances.\n\nEveryone could, in theory, behave with benevolence and sensitivity. But this doesn\u2019t come naturally when a person has had to wait for the bus for forty minutes in the rain, when they haven\u2019t had sex in a month, when the boiler has broken again, when three of their good friends earn four times as much as they do, when they have a searing pain in their left knee \u2013 and when no one has been properly kind and thoughtful about their life and circumstances for many years.\n\nWhat may also explain the hatred that descends on us is the extent to which our misdeeds and errors hold a denied, unconscious allure to those who jeer and condemn us most intensely. Our bitterest foes might also, at some level, want to have an affair or leave their family behind. They might secretly desire to get drunk and speak their mind or cheat the accounts. The condemnation is being driven by attempts to pin on one specific person longings that many others share in their depths. They hate in us a disavowed part of themselves.\n\nWe might imagine that the way to create a kinder world would be to lecture people on manners and ethics \u2013 but what we really need is a world in which everyone is shown sufficient kindness so that stamping on others no longer holds such allure. The true measure of a civilisation is the degree to which people can be good and generous even when no one is watching. This is possible only when they do not feel emotionally exhausted and belittled, because they have been cared for in the past \u2013 and so have reserves of tenderness to lend to others in the future.\n\nIt is unfortunate that at our moment of failure, it\u2019s likely that we will meet with quite so much hatred \u2013 that thousands of people may seem keen to deny our remaining claims to humanity just when we need them most. But when the time comes, we must cling to a richer explanation of why this sort of nastiness unfolds. It isn\u2019t because we are such awful people (just averagely muddled and sinful ones). Rather, there is no spirit of forgiveness at large because there isn\u2019t sufficient love in circulation. We are a mean world because, despite all of our apparent wealth, we are such a limitlessly unhappy one. Our enemies aren\u2019t simply cruel, and they definitely aren\u2019t correct: they just feel very, very unloved.",

      "content": "## How to Deal with the Meanness of the Media\n\nIf we look at the media from a particular angle, we stand to notice a distinctive fact: almost every story is about failure. What we call a news story is in essence a \u2018failure story\u2019 \u2013 someone\u2019s marriage has fallen apart, someone\u2019s business has gone bankrupt, someone has been fired, someone is involved in a scandal, someone has gone \u2018mad\u2019.\n\nThere is something else. These stories of failure are not, in general, told with any particular imagination or sympathy. Instead, what stands out is the unrelieved viciousness and condemnatory tone on display. If we are to believe the media, all politicians are intrinsically awful, venal, self-interested and actively trying to bring down the nation they claim to care for. People who come to grief in business are monstrous exemplars of greed, exploitation, stupidity and narrow-mindedness. Those who have offended society\u2019s moral codes became addicts on purpose, they were hell-bent on having affairs or they actively wanted to hurt their families. Sexual infractions \u2013 particular favourites of news organisations \u2013 are overwhelmingly the result of \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018depravity\u2019. Indeed, most people who feature in the day\u2019s news are simply weirdos, perverts and losers. There are never more complex motives. No one is ever profoundly sorry. No one wishes to make amends. No one ever tried hard to be good. No one was ever a child. The appetite is for moral clarity \u2013 and the news delivers reliably every time, at the expense of truth and humanity.\n\nIn reality, there exist almost no villains of the sort the media presents. An alcoholic is, up close, liable to be filled with repentance and guilt, most politicians would so desperately like to make things better and sexual compulsives are \u2013 in their lucid moments \u2013 usually appalled by what they have done. The news isn\u2019t telling us the facts about people who have failed; it is giving us a window onto our emotional need to locate caricatures.\n\nLong before we ever had news organisations \u2013 before there were minute-by-minute bulletins and correspondents in every city \u2013 human beings evolved a sophisticated medium for telling stories of failure with a complexity and honesty that modern news organisations never match. In the 4th century BCE, the ancient Greeks gave birth to what we know as \u2018tragedy\u2019 \u2013 the art of telling stories of failure with complexity, kindness and moral sophistication. Like news editors, the ancient tragedians picked up on the grimmest stories. They told tales of people who had lied, who had stolen money, who had had affairs, who had slept with members of their families, who had let pride and greed obstruct their judgement. But rather than labelling these figures as weirdos, perverts, reprobates and freaks, the Greeks did something far more interesting: they continued to see them as full and complex human beings, albeit ones who \u2013 like all of us \u2013 suffered from a fatal flaw in some area or another. The Greeks called this flaw a \u2018hamartia\u2019 \u2013 and it was because of a hamartia that a king might poison a rival, or a man might sleep with his mother. Crucially for the Greeks, though, a hamartia did not turn a person into a devil \u2013 to view matters like this would be too easy or na\u00efve. The bitter truth that the Greek playwrights wished to convey is that people who end up doing bad things are fundamentally no different from you or me \u2013 they are just far less lucky. They get found out for the sorts of things that we have often done ourselves, but which to date we have been able to get away with. They give free rein to impulses that we share but which circumstances have, so far, allowed us to bottle up more securely. The central figures of Greek tragedy aren\u2019t worse than anyone else; fate has given their flaws a terrifying window through which to become visible and active in the world.\n\nOur response to hearing of failure and disaster should therefore be compassion for others and fear for ourselves \u2013 based on an awareness of how lucky we have been, until now, not to have paid the full price for our own weaknesses of character.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the enduring skill of the great tragedians, in both ancient and more modern times, that the failed characters they have told us about have not become bywords for ignominy and evil \u2013 but are instead people whose sorrows deeply concern us and whose cruel fates we bemoan and weep over. It would never occur to us to callously call Oedipus, Antigone, Othello or Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles freaks or reprobates. We see them in infinitely more rounded ways. We perceive their hamartia, certainly \u2013 the strain of greed, lust, impulsiveness, na\u00efvety or selfishness in their character that leads to their downfall \u2013 but it is placed alongside other qualities that we are never allowed to overlook. The failed hero we meet in such works of art is also capable of immense kindness, thoughtfulness, wisdom, self-sacrifice and nobility of spirit. Through these stories, we are inducted into a truth that the modern world finds far too uncomfortable to hold on to: that someone might be good and flawed, gentle and thoughtless, decent and compulsive.\n\nIf we were to make a list of all the great tragic heroes and their hamartias, we would find that the difference between most of us and them is not the presence of a hamartia, but that we have not yet made the fateful error that gives ours free rein. In this study, we can identify what our own hamartias are and imagine what errors and tragic consequences might develop for us \u2013 if ever fate so chose.",

The only reason why they seem different is that Sophocles and Shakespeare insisted on treating them as rounded humans rather than one-dimensional monsters. Had they, and other great writers (Racine, Tolstoy, Fitzgerald, Eliot, Woolf and so on), had the chance to set to work on the news stories of today, then we would find that there are as many people to weep over, sympathise with and feel pity for today as there were in the canon of Greek or Elizabethan theatre, or the pages of Russian or French literature. Whatever the technical capacities of the authors of tragedies, what is ultimately most impressive is their moral capacity; their ability to look beneath the obvious markers of \u2018evil\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019 and to detect the human being beneath the murderer, the child within the prisoner, the wise person behind the lunatic. In reality, as these great writers insist to us, there is no such thing as a monster \u2013 apart from in the imagination of news organisations and our own over-hasty condemnations. When the media takes care to impress on us that they are telling \u2018the truth\u2019, our consciences should start to signal loudly that something is amiss. We cannot be being told the truth at all. Wherever it is too easy to hate and to mock, the truth has gone missing.\n\nWe can put this theory to the test in even the most extreme cases. Let us imagine we come across a story on a news website entitled, \u2018Weirdo doc guilty of downloading sick porn images\u2019. The news tells us: A depraved doctor from Sunderland who downloaded more than 1,300 extreme sex images, including scenes of torture and animal cruelty, has been sentenced and jailed for five years. Police found the sickening images on the laptop of Bill Scotch, 34, from Dainsdale Avenue. The doctor, who worked at the town\u2019s hospital as a surgeon, earlier admitted to looking at the filthy images. He was sentenced unanimously by the jury and taken away in handcuffs from court.\n\nInitially, the case seems clear. This man is a devil, and it would be best to lock him in a faraway cell and throw away the keys. But so much of how we respond to people\u2019s failure depends on how their story is told. In reality, we would be capable of sympathising with, and feeling sorry for, pretty much anyone \u2013 so long as their story was narrated to us in a particular way. As an extreme example, if it were told to us in the way that a visiting angel, Jesus or the Buddha might tell it.\n\nNews organisations tend to worry about generating sympathy because they do not trust their audiences to juggle two ideas: that someone could have done a terrible thing for which they will have to spend time in prison \u2013 and at the same time, that this person remains a human being. The news can\u2019t seem to trust that we might be capable of such two-tiered thinking. Either we have to hate everyone who does anything wrong and then feel happy about their punishment, or else we might see them in more rounded ways and would call for all prison doors to be flung open.\n\nIn order to protect us from moral complexity, the news rushes its stories \u2013 for the more compressed an account, the less our emotions can be nuanced. It\u2019s always the headline that attracts most outrage, while it\u2019s no coincidence that the great tragic plays tend to last a few hours and the tragic novels for 400 pages. The more one knows, the harder it is to ridicule and condemn. Even with the bestial doctor, the more we read, the more our emotions might shift:\n\nCondemning the man to his cell, the judge remarked: \u2018You have thrown away your whole life for the sake of a few hours of gratification. You deserve to be ashamed of yourself forever.\u2019 Hearing this, the doctor threw himself on the ground and started wailing \u2013 and had to be picked up by the guards. The police informed the court that the man had at first denied downloading the images, then tried to stab himself in the kitchen while officers were upstairs. His wife of three years has taken away their newborn son and asked for a divorce. His own family have disowned him.\n\nEven though we are genuinely horrified by what the doctor has done, it is hard not to shudder when we think of how seven years of medical school, a PhD in a top university and endless hours of work have come to this. An update to the story informs us that the man twice tried to take his life in prison.\n\nNone of this is any easier to bear than the plot line of Antigone or Ph\u00e8dre; we\u2019re simply not used to applying a morally complex lens to the figures we are confronted with in the news or to the lives around us. We need to remember the tragic perspective of love, tolerance and forgiveness \u2013 both for others and for ourselves, the day we fail.",

      "content": "## How to Live with Your Hamartia\n\nWhen we fail, part of what makes our fate harder to deal with than it needs to be is that we are operating with the idea that a person is essentially either \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. We are stuck within a basic binary ethical paradigm \u2013 and sadly for us, we may become convinced that, because of what we have done, we are condemned to always be inherently and totally \u2018bad\u2019.\n\nThis is \u2013 one might add \u2013 the paradigm of children. It never occurs to small children that the adults around them might be a range of opposing things: good and bad, impatient and kind, loving and annoying. The perception of moral complexity belongs to the developing mind. It\u2019s a feat of the imagination to be able to see that a good person may do a bad thing, that there may be a difference between what someone does and what they truly meant to do and that an impulse or compulsion is not the same as a reasoned stance.\n\nIt is another genius idea of the ancient Greeks that breaks us out of the good\u2013bad paradigm. They insisted on two broad and helpful ideas: all of us mean well and are in that sense fundamentally good \u2013 but we are also beset by a multitude of hamartias. In this way, the Greeks arrived at a very subtle ethical stance: we are good, but broken.\n\nThis realisation helps us to tolerate ourselves. We certainly may have done and said some truly terrible things, but does this have to make us untenably awful people? No, because there is a difference between our being and our flaws. We are not our flaws. Our flaws shape our lives, but they are not the last word on everything we are. We exist outside of them, however ghastly they may be.\n\nThis generous philosophy gives us a little room for mental manoeuvre. We have to atone, we have to take responsibility, we have to despise what we have done and we have to apologise to those we have hurt. But we do not \u2013 in the end \u2013 have to be without kindness for ourselves.",

      "content": "## How to Deal with the Pity of Friends\n\nAt times of failure, we can expect to be handled with outright disdain and loud hostility by many of the people we encounter. It might, therefore, sound odd to single out as particularly problematic \u2013 and especially painful \u2013 a kind of treatment that, on the surface, seems like kindness.\n\nWhen they hear of our disaster, a certain sort of acquaintance will rush to offer us gentle-sounding words. They will ask us with concern how we are doing; they will enquire if they can get us anything at all at what must be a very difficult moment for us; they will say that they can imagine how awful things are and how in agony we must be. They will end a call by entreating us to get in touch with them whenever we want \u2013 day or night, weekends too \u2013 if they can be of assistance of any kind. They might even briefly sigh and say in a tender voice: \u2018Poor you!\u2019\n\nHow could we be so ungrateful as to mind this treatment, when other people may at this very moment be calling us an idiot, a lunatic or worse? Yet the latter approach might almost be preferable; however bracing, we would at least know where we stood.\n\nWhat can make honey-coated kindness unbearable is its entanglement with one of the most pernicious emotions we can ever be on the receiving end of: pity. To be pitied is to be placed in a special category of loneliness; to be accorded pariah status at the very moment when what we long for is solace and a confirmation of our right to belong to the human race. The pitying person recognises how desperate our condition is, but what subverts their efforts to be kind is the energy with which they make it clear that our sorrow is ours and ours alone \u2013 and that they will not, and could never be, touched by any similar horror. They want to be sweet to us, of course, but what they will not do is recognise that they are as open to foolishness, accident and suffering as we are. Their fear compels them to create a solid wall between our condition and theirs. They need to remind us, and most importantly themselves, that they are firmly rooted on dry land, while we are out there drowning in the ocean swell. Perhaps they will throw us a small life raft \u2013 but what they don\u2019t want is to imagine ever needing one themselves.\n\nPity is troubling because it lies so close to something we all desperately want, which is sympathy. Both the pity-bearing and the sympathetic person will say \u2018poor you\u2019. Both will recognise our troubles, our pain and the extent of our fall. But the pity-bearing person is cruel in their implication that the mess we\u2019re in is only ours. They fail to remind us of the crucial truth, which is a great deal more accurate as well as more humane: that we are all, at all times, a hair\u2019s breadth away from agony.\n\nThe pity-bearing friend reminds us of the distinctiveness of our situation because they are not strong enough to accept the trouble they might face in the future. They may visit us in the hospital, but it\u2019s quietly evident that they couldn\u2019t ever picture themselves in such a bleak place. They may help us to pay for our groceries, but heaven forbid they would ever one day have to ask a friend for money in turn.\n\nA truly heart-warming and consoling friend is someone robust and mature enough to be reconciled to their own exposure to pain. They know that though they are not on the ward right now, they might easily be soon enough; they understand that everything we are suffering from could touch them one day too \u2013 that our sins have echoes in their own hearts. They understand that they haven\u2019t been granted immunity from folly and horror; they may be fine right now, but they almost certainly won\u2019t be in the end, because life is long and because they are human \u2013 and therefore condemned to exquisite kinds of suffering, as we all are. This is the emotional background that will lend their words consolation and their hugs sincerity.\n\nIn the end, we should not resent the pity-bearing person. They are not causing us suffering on purpose \u2013 and generally they have no clue that they are. They are just very afraid of being like us, not yet accepting that one day they will have to drink from the cup of suffering we\u2019ve been forced to down. We frighten them; we are ghoulish evocations of everything they are in flight from. When we experience pity, we must remind ourselves that we are not imagining a problem; we are right to sense how delicately we are being kept at bay, with an imaginary long stick and surgical gloves. Our pity-bearing friend may have called us up to see how we are, but as we take in their well-muffled terror, we should turn the tables on them and reassert our sense of agency and dignity in the face of their sweetly patronising concern. We are explorers of regions that they are still too brittle and apprehensive to travel to \u2013 if anyone is in need of a dose of reassuring kindness, it may be them.",

      "content": "## How to Deal with the Success of Friends\n\nOnce we have become failures, we grow acutely conscious of the moments in everyday life in which we can sense afresh the relative good fortune of others \u2013 in the small details which, before our downfall, we would scarcely have noticed, let alone been pained by. The most routine chats will be punctuated with unexpected jabs of pain. For example, someone might mention (without any ill will) that they attended an office party, where they gave a little speech thanking their colleagues for their efforts. It might not have been any special kind of triumph \u2013 but to us it will be yet another reminder that we have been made redundant, with no hope of finding an equivalent position any time soon. Or someone might remark that they invited the neighbours round for a drink \u2013 again, scarcely a boast, but still an agonising signal of social acceptance when we have just been found guilty of fraud and the tale of our felonies is all over the papers. Or perhaps a friend alludes to something funny their teenage child told them, immediately reminding us of the coldly furious manner of our own offspring, bitter about the recent divorce. It doesn\u2019t take much to be reminded of the scale of our problems \u2013 and the thought of how many ordinary pleasures and routines are no longer available to us. We may even feel jealous of small babies being wheeled around the park by loving parents who pause to ask them if they\u2019d like a drink. Why can\u2019t we be them? Why can\u2019t our lives be simple and safe? However, instead of feeling jealous of others \u2013 friends, babies in the park \u2013 we need to feel compassion for the reasons why we aren\u2019t them. Our parents were very different; our start set us on a far more arduous path.\n\nThe temptation is to make a direct comparison between the lives of others and our own: simply to wish that we could be in exactly their place. To weaken that sentiment, it helps to remind ourselves of the many ways in which we are, and always were, different from those we are presently choosing to compare ourselves to. To look across the aisle and want to swap our lives for theirs is to underestimate the many powerful \u2013 and sometimes painful \u2013 reasons why we are as we are. The particular travails of our childhood shaped us in very distinctive ways; we had to contend with challenges that others escaped. We haven\u2019t merely coped differently with life; we have very different minds. If the people we long to swap lives with had been in our shoes, they might have failed even more gravely than we did.\n\nIt may seem as if we are just being envious, but it\u2019s more nuanced than that. Envious people are aspirational \u2013 they are tortured by the thought of what they could have, whether that be greater wealth or fame, houses or love. We are more modest. We know we won\u2019t be able to improve our lot; we are on our knees. We just wish we weren\u2019t so alone with our peculiar kind of banishment and shame; we wish we weren\u2019t the only ones to be thrown into despair by ordinary terms like \u2018office party\u2019, \u2018holiday\u2019, \u2018cosy evening\u2019 or \u2018family\u2019. We don\u2019t want their joy \u2013 what we really wish (for our sake, and not because we mean them ill) is that they could have some of our misery.\n\nUnfortunately, we will continue to be constantly tormented until we take measures to protect ourselves. We must face up to our distinctive punishment: to keep ourselves largely apart from other people, because so-called normality is no longer our home and so hurts too much to be part of. The average party will be hell for us; it would be preferable to be sedated and locked up than to attend a school reunion. We\u2019re going to need to change our way of socialising to take our failure into account. Excepting those few, rare individuals who are especially skilled at compassion and sympathy, we will need to separate ourselves from everyone who has not \u2013 in some significant way \u2013 also made a mess of their lives. It sounds radical and one-dimensional, but we will not be doing ourselves any favours by pretending that it is possible to keep up with people who are not comparably wounded. At this time, we are simply not strong enough to deal with the happiness of others. Dating sites and apps have learnt how to match people algorithmically by their interests: golf, comics of the 1950s, the art of Weimar Germany \u2026 It\u2019s clear how much shared passions can matter. As failed people, we will have distinctive passions of our own that it will pay to recognise and use as the bedrocks for new forms of socialising. Having reluctantly become world experts in grief and loss, in lying in bed and weeping at our disgraced state, in going over our errors and bemoaning our idiocy, in thinking of killing ourselves and searching for reasons to go on, we should put our skills to work.\n\nThere is no point in continuing to spend time with people who are hoping to become partners in their law firm next year and who take their children on skiing holidays. What we need, first and foremost, are people who have banged their heads against the walls from psychological torment and who are getting by with the use of medication or therapy. Though it used to, it doesn\u2019t really matter now what else they care or know about. Maybe our new friends never went to university or perhaps they don\u2019t read books; they might be pushed to tell us when the Second World War took place (or what it was), or they might have had a career in armed robbery or smuggled cars across the border; maybe they spent a few years on a psychiatric ward. None of that matters in the least. All that counts is that they have suffered a lot and that they have warm and open hearts. We might surprise ourselves by how much closer these new friends become than anyone in our previous life, BF (Before Failure). There is likely to be a lot less grandstanding and one-upmanship. Everyone knows that everyone else is done for; there aren\u2019t any prizes for showing off, there are no options to boast or impress.\n\nWe will be using friendship to open our hearts, explore our vulnerabilities, speak without inhibition about our insecurities and gain a sense of being helpful through assuaging the pains of others. It\u2019s only a pity that we had to lose everything before we at last learnt what other people might be for.",

      "content": "## A Life Devoid of Narcissism\n\nNarcissism \u2013 named after Narcissus, the young and handsome Greek mythological figure who was afflicted by an immoderate pride in his own appearance \u2013 is a state of mind that is typically condemned and ridiculed by sensible voices. We associate maturity with scepticism towards ourselves, and an inclination towards modesty and self-deprecation.\n\nNevertheless, a number of psychologists have pointed out the importance of a quality known as \u2018healthy narcissism\u2019 \u2013 by which is meant a nourishing, basic level of satisfaction with how we are perceived, how we look and what we have done and said. Healthy narcissism is demonstrated in the little glow we feel when someone pays us a compliment or when we\u2019re told that a mutual acquaintance respects us; when we see our name on a report we spent many months working on or when we are invited to contribute to a conference in our professional field. Catching our reflection in a shop window in a city street, we might \u2013 as healthy narcissists \u2013 feel a little lift at the passing thought that we\u2019re looking rather nice at the moment.\n\nExtreme failure shatters every opportunity for this kind of low-level and sustaining self-regard. Narcissism of any sort becomes simply impossible. Given the level of our shame and the amount of condemnation from others, it is hard to think of anything remotely connected with who we are that doesn\u2019t make us close our eyes and wince. We cannot bear to think of our past achievements; they merely remind us of our subsequent disasters and idiocies. We are embarrassed to think of everything to do with who we are. Our very name \u2013 infamous on the lips of many \u2013 frightens us. We avoid the slightest encounters with our own faces. We don\u2019t really want to exist as a topic of reflection for ourselves. We come to be about as far away from narcissism, of any kind, as it\u2019s possible for a human to be.\n\nSo extreme is this stance, that it must be examined for its lessons. Its horrific dimensions are of course evident. It would be so comforting if only we were able to like ourselves a bit more; to hold on to the idea that we are not only a monster or a fool; to have access to some echo of the feeling we had in childhood when we were told we were good and sweet, when we were cuddled and our hair was stroked. But our self-censoring mechanisms no longer allow it. We cannot have an agreeable past, future or present. Our essential self is contaminated and therefore something we are impelled to ignore.\n\nThrough this emotional turmoil, however, we unexpectedly come close to a state of mind lauded by the most accomplished sages of the Buddhist tradition. For Buddhists, ultimate enlightenment is reached when we finally manage to obliterate the self and see the world without the distracting, petty and vain distorting lens of the \u2018I\u2019. For a true sage, who we happen to be is an entirely random and negligible accident, which we must strive to move beyond; it shouldn\u2019t matter what we look like, how others perceive us, whether we were born rich or poor, what people are saying about us or how long we will live. All that counts is to pierce the veil of immediate and petty illusion in order to attune ourselves to the broadest totality of being: to take our place as an observer of cosmic reality. A sage will strive (through exhaustive meditative practices) to forget everything about their self; they seek to merge with the universe and take their rightful, anonymous, temporary place alongside wind, rocks, the raging oceans and billions of dying stars.\n\nThrough the most ghastly process, we will have entirely overcome ourselves. Without subscribing to any spiritual groups, we\u2019ll have managed to focus single-mindedly on things beyond us. This isn\u2019t what anyone but a few die-hard monks might be seeking, but there is \u2013 arguably \u2013 a degree of genuine achievement behind our exquisite pain. We now endure in a curious, liminal space: we can\u2019t really exist to ourselves any more, and yet we are still obliged to be alive. Unlike most other people on the planet, we are extensively dissociated from our own being; we can\u2019t think of our bodies, our pasts, our futures or our selves in the minds of others. None of that matters \u2013 or it is, more accurately, past bothering with. We are instead entirely focused on what is beyond us; pure observers of the world outside of our selves.\n\nFor Buddhists, this kind of liberation is an end in itself. For us, it threatens \u2013 on its own \u2013 to be a hollow and eerie state. We need to convert it into the first step towards a more redemptive and tolerable condition: a life that we can live in the service of causes that are somehow \u2018larger\u2019 than we are. We\u2019ll have fulfilled the promise of our pain and self-abnegation when we succeed in placing something compellingly meaningful at the centre of our scarred lives: a deserving cause beyond us. It might be a job, a project, a suffering child or adult \u2026 We have no option but to forget ourselves and to live for others.",

      "content": "## Living with Permanent Infamy\n\nWhen search engines first came into prominence in the late 1990s, they promised to correct one of our minds\u2019 greatest flaws: amnesia. It would no longer matter if we forgot the way back home, the name of the local hardware store or the date of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign. The internet would have the missing information ready for us in milliseconds.\n\nWhat most people overlooked, however, was that this relentless ability to remember everything \u2013 and forget nothing, even the B-side of a particular Beatles single, the name of Marcus Aurelius\u2019s mother or the road from Ipswich to Lowestoft \u2013 would eventually have the power to trail and torment us into eternity if we were ever unlucky or foolish enough to err.\n\nThe internet has become an eternal charge sheet and bulletin board of every human being\u2019s record of disgrace, failure and idiocy. Twenty years after an infraction, the internet still reminds everyone about what we did and how others judged it \u2013 and the misdemeanour is as shocking and disappointing as it ever was. It doesn\u2019t matter if, in the intervening period, we have transformed our character, apologised to everyone involved, adopted a new religion or purged our soul. In the implacable opinion of the internet, we are fated to forever be our own worst moment \u2013 as captured by a journalist, or even just a passing stranger armed with a mobile phone and social media account, untrained in the empathetic methods of a Greek playwright. The curious barman at the hotel, the bank employee, the family at the next table \u2013 all are able to tap into their phone and know. We can never be a \u2018nobody\u2019 or even a \u2018somebody quite nice\u2019; we are always and forever the disgrace we once were.\n\nAs a society, we have over the years grown sensitive to the burden placed on individuals by prejudices and biases around race, gender and background. We have become aware of how crushing it is to disappear into a ready-made negative category in someone\u2019s mind, and associate civilisation with a community in which everyone has the opportunity to escape summary and be discovered anew. It may sound obscene to compare the innocent victims of prejudice with the often-deserved opprobrium directed at those who have failed \u2013 yet we might at least propose that a civilised society should know when to curtail punishment. Just as we accept that there should be a prison \u2018term\u2019 \u2013 that after two or five or twenty-five years someone should have served their time \u2013 so we might propose that there should be a defined end to the punishment of infamy.\n\nYet if internet-enabled infamy remains lifelong, it\u2019s partly because most of us fail to see it in the same way we would a prison sentence: we can intuitively understand why having to subsist in a bare, ugly cell should count as a severe chastisement, but we may never have taken the time to reflect on the distinctive burden constituted by infamy. We might even complain that someone who is merely mocked and shunned but has not gone to prison has got off lightly. Yet a moment of reflection should show us that infamy is very much its own burden and not a negligible one at that. As infamous people, we may, theoretically, be able to travel anywhere we like, but we will always be judged in the same entirely damning way. We will always be imprisoned within the negative assumption of others; we will never be able to spring open the door of the cage of suspicion and condemnation. And what\u2019s worse, there will never be a judge who can say that now enough is enough; never a jury that will reconsider the facts and set us free. Infamous people are put in cells and the keys thrown away.\n\nThe punishment of the infamous is endless because it exists in a public mind that is continuously informed by the eternal memory of the internet \u2013 and that never sees any reason to doubt what it reads. After all, if this magical internet is able to summon the exact map coordinates we require or the precise cost of a new lamp, why would we ever doubt its ability to give us the correct information about the weirdo at the next table or the ridiculous candidate we were considering interviewing for a job. No counter-narrative can ever be built that will be powerful enough to control the floodwaters of damning online data. Shakespeare or Sophocles could write the finest drama about our fate, but for the average person with a phone we would still be the disgusting person who deserved every hateful comment accorded by a journalist twenty-two years ago.\n\nIt is worth registering this problem \u2013 but certainly not worth hoping for anything to change any time soon. Evolution here is measured in centuries. It took the better part of 1,000 years for humanity to realise that it was probably not a good idea to put people in stocks. In the medieval Netherlands, arriving late to church would result in one being draped in \u2018stones of shame\u2019 \u2013 large rocks linked by a heavy metal chain. In medieval Austria, spouses accused of being \u2018argumentative\u2019 were locked in a \u2018shrew\u2019s fiddle\u2019, a portable pillory that locked the hands upwards in front of the face; an attached bell let the townspeople know that a \u2018shrew\u2019 was approaching so that they could run out of their homes and mock her. The good old days!\n\nIn the 14th\u201316th centuries, women across Europe could be disgraced for cuckolding or scolding their husbands, or for bearing an \u2018illegitimate\u2019 child. Punishment was often by the \u2018cucking stool\u2019 or \u2018ducking stool\u2019, a large wooden armchair fixed to a wooden arm over a lake or river; the accused would be ducked as many times as her alleged crime dictated. Often, she did not survive.\n\nThe most common form of public humiliation around this time was when a convicted criminal was restrained in a pillory (a wooden frame with holes for the head and hands) and displayed in a public place, where they could not hide from the jeers, abuse and rubbish that were thrown at them. The crowd were expected to demonstrate their disgust with the convict \u2013 if the crime was particularly heinous or offensive, they might have rotten eggs and slaughterhouse waste flung at them. For this reason, pillories were usually placed at the busiest site in a town or city \u2013 at the intersection of two major streets or roads, in the marketplace or town square, or in front of a church. In London in 1810, six men were pilloried for two days for \u2018sodomy\u2019; the City had to pay 252 constables to stand guard and protect them from an enraged mob, who nevertheless pelted the men with mud, dead cats, rotten eggs and vegetables, blood, offal and dung. The pillory remained a standard judicial sentence for sedition, homosexuality, extortion, fraud and perjury in Britain until 1837.\n\nA shrew\u2019s fiddle, or neck violin, 18th century\n\nIllustration of a ducking stool from an 18th-century chapbook\n\nNumberless variations of these kinds of instruments of punishment were devised. The \u2018scold\u2019s bridle\u2019 was designed to inhibit speech and feeding by means of a piece of metal that depressed the tongue, and it was commonly used in England and Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries as a \u2018minor\u2019 punishment for women found guilty of scolding or gossiping.\n\nThe jougs was an iron neck-collar and chain attached to a church wall, commonly used in Scotland. Those found guilty of offences like drunkenness, gossiping or missing church would be placed in the jougs and made to beg forgiveness from their neighbours passing in and out of the church.\n\nIn other words (lest we doubted it), we are a limitlessly judgemental species that appears to gain a lot of relief from our disappointments by hating others, without measure, for being \u2018bad\u2019. We should not add to our sorrows by imagining that we might be living in a forgiving world.\n\nA scold\u2019s bridle, 17th\u201318th century\n\nJougs, Sorn Church, East Ayrshire, Scotland, c. 17th century\n\nThe good news is that we are also highly adaptable. We love having two legs, but, if fate were to decree it, we\u2019d end up being able to get by on one. It\u2019s very nice not to have to sit in urine-stained underpants, but you can tell someone they need their bladder removed and they\u2019ll generally keep living and be grateful for the chance to do so. It\u2019s nice to speak, of course, but people can and will endure having their voice box removed and having to talk through an electronic replacement. Possibilities that seem hugely difficult to cope with from a distance have a habit \u2013 once we have to go through them \u2013 of proving survivable. It\u2019s not what we would have chosen, for sure, but we cope. We may be the person who everyone in the community hates and mocks and thinks evil, but we can take it. Every time we walk into a room, we can be sure that ninety-eight per cent of the people there are sniggering \u2013 and yet we hold on to reasons to keep living.\n\nThat\u2019s the level of pain we need to be ready for.\n\nThere are upsides to amnesia. If we can allow ourselves to forget, we can also cease to torture ourselves with comparisons between what we once had and what we have now. We won\u2019t remember or dwell too much on what it was like to have two legs or a functioning bladder or a name that wasn\u2019t dirt. We can inhabit the present; the past is another country whose outlines can be left to grow blessedly vague.\n\nWhen we are infamous, very few people will want to talk to us. Our interactions with \u2018most people\u2019 will be sharply curtailed. It is at this point that we will discover that the only people whose time and interest we can really hold out for are those who know about something that is widely esteemed but almost never understood: love.",

      "content": "## What Love Really Is and Why It Matters\n\nThere is so much talk of love in our societies; it would be natural to think that by now we must know what it is and why it counts. Love, we think, is the excited feeling we get in the presence of someone of unusual accomplishment and talent \u2013 great intelligence or beauty for the most part \u2013 who we hope will reciprocate our interest and whom we badly want to touch, caress and one day share our lives with. This definition sounds so plausible and enjoys such powerful cultural endorsement that we are apt to miss another vision of love altogether \u2013 this one focused not so much on an appreciation of strength as on a tolerance of, and kindness towards, what is weak and misshapen.\n\nAccording to this alternative vision, we display love when, for example, on the way home, we come across an itinerant drunk \u2013 weather-beaten and dishevelled, beer-addled and ranting \u2013 and do not turn away, but instead take the momentous internal step (with all the eventual outward actions that might follow) of considering them as a version of ourselves, prey to the same passions and distempers, visited by the same longings, upset by similar losses and worthy of their own share of compassion and tolerance.\n\nWe show love, too, when we see a well-dressed person shouting imperiously at an airport, filled with self-righteousness, apparently bloated on their own self-regard, and do not dismiss them immediately as insane or entitled, but instead, take the trouble to see the frightened, vulnerable self beneath the bluster. When we grow curious as to the sickness of the soul that might be operating just below the surface and are able to wonder what has hurt them \u2013 and why they might be so scared.\n\nIt is love that sparks within us when we see a small child throwing themselves on the floor in the aisle of a supermarket, shouting that they want \u2018it\u2019 again and again, and do not simply focus on how inconvenient it is to steer our trolley around them and how piercing and maddening their screams are, but also feel how much we understand their frustration \u2013 and long to tell them that their pain is, in its general form, our own.\n\nIt is also love \u2013 the proper and most serious variety in the universe \u2013 when our partner is being plainly irrational, unfair, mean-spirited and maddening, and yet we do not, as we so easily might, launch a full dose of righteous anger their way, but instead hold back a little and wonder why this formerly sane and interesting adult should have fallen apart in this manner. When we contemplate the idea that they are not merely awful and vicious, but instead might not have slept very well last night, are perhaps panicked by what the future might bring them or might inside be dealing with feelings of lacerating self-contempt that they hardly understand, let alone know how to master. It is love to go up to them and extend our arms at precisely the juncture when we have so many reasons to slam the door in their face.\n\nHowever many songs celebrate the act, it is no particular feat to love someone who is on their best behaviour, who looks beautiful and who moves with grace through the world. What really cry out for our attention and our love are rather those people and things that are crooked and gnarled, damaged and self-disgusted. In this definition, love is the effort required to accurately imagine oneself in the life of another human \u2013 one who has not made it in any way easy to admire or even like them.\n\nIt is love when a novelist spends 300 pages detailing the interior life of a violent criminal and allows us to see the innocent child within the guilty adult. In the Christian tradition, it was the man from Nazareth who gave us the most memorable demonstrations of this sort of love \u2013 who made it seem glamorous to love differently from the Romans and the Greeks; to love the prostitute, the prisoner and the sinner, to show love to a wretch and an enemy. To extrapolate from this approach, we might imagine that a truly Christian dating app would not merely highlight the beautiful and the dazzling or allow us to swipe away every slightly displeasing person at a stroke, but would instead stop us arbitrarily at photographs of more challenging figures \u2013 those shunned by society, shocking reprobates \u2013 and command, with all the authority of divine intonation, \u2018Love! Here where it would feel so natural and so easy to hate, your duty is to love \u2026\u2019\n\nThat such a command sounds peculiar and laughable is a measure of how we have forgotten this sort of love and how committed we are to love-as-admiration. Yet it is possible to suggest that nothing is more important than this love \u2013 that this is the love that rescues nations from intolerance, that pauses wars, that halts recriminations, that calms furies, that prevents murders and that allows civilisation to continue. True love involves precisely not giving someone what is their due but giving them what they need in order to survive instead.\n\nNot least, the spirit of love demands that we acknowledge how much we ourselves may one day stand in need of this form of love-as-forgiveness. We cannot rely on always having justice on our side, in always being able to make a claim on others based on our own unsullied righteousness and goodness. At some point, we may well have to cry for mercy. We may have no leg to stand on. We may have behaved foolishly, and might be in line for severe punishment from a judge who closely follows the letter of the law. At this point, we should hope that there is someone around who still remembers what true love is. Someone who will undertake the heroic effort of not giving us what we deserve, but rather recalling that there must be a sweet and distinctly blameless child beneath the horrible and difficult adult we have become. Someone who can bypass the jeering mob and offer us counsel and reassurance, knowing that every human has a claim upon forgiveness and imagination.\n\nPerhaps, by this example, we will in turn become people who know how to love properly \u2013 and after our particular crisis has passed, we may make the effort to extend love to others who have transgressed, so that society can \u2013 through this enriching mutuality of imagination \u2013 become a less frightening and less harried place for all. A place in which we know to treat one another like naughty children who can be redeemed, rather than felonious wrongdoers who must be loathed into eternity.",

      "content": "## Let Him Who Is without Sin Cast the First Stone\n\nWe are so used to thinking of Jesus as a divinity whom we accept or reject on the basis of faith, that we are apt to miss a far more relevant detail: he was an extremely acute philosopher, whose directions on human conduct maintain a deep applicability.\n\nOne of the most salient of Jesus\u2019s secular lessons comes in chapter eight of the Gospel According to John. Jesus has recently come down from Galilee to Jerusalem when some Pharisees \u2013 members of a sect focused on precise adherence to Jewish tradition and law \u2013 present him with a married woman whom they have caught having sex with someone other than her husband. \u2018Teacher,\u2019 they ask him, \u2018this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. In our law, Moses commanded that such a woman must be stoned to death. Now what do you say?\u2019\n\nJesus is being edged into a trap. Will he say that it is completely fine to have an affair (in other words, to condone something that his society regards as very wrong)? Or will the mild-mannered preacher of love and forgiveness turn out to be just as strict about legal matters as the Jewish authorities he likes to criticise?\n\nJesus makes a deft move. He doesn\u2019t categorically deny the mob the right to stone the woman to death \u2013 but he adds one apparently small, but in practice epochal, caveat to this right. They can stone her to their hearts, content if, and only if, they can be absolutely sure that they have first satisfied one crucial criterion: they have never done anything wrong themselves.\n\nBy this, Jesus doesn\u2019t mean just that they have never slept around outside of their marriage \u2013 he means if they have never done anything wrong at all, whatsoever, in any area of their lives. Only absolute moral purity, Jesus suggests, grants us the right to be vicious, high-handed and unsparing towards transgressors. An important principle of ethics is being introduced here: we can only be counted as properly innocent when we have done nothing wrong whatsoever, at any point and in any context \u2013 not simply when we are blameless in one area or another. If we have slipped up in any field, even one very far removed from the crime at hand, then we are duty bound to stretch our powers of empathy, to strive to identify with the wrongdoer and to show them an advanced degree of mercy and charity. We may not have committed the particular crime they are being punished for, but we are implicated in sin more generally \u2013 and therefore must forgive.\n\nJesus responds to the Pharisees with what have become immortal words: \u2018Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.\u2019 The mob, understanding the rebuke, put down their projectiles and the terrified woman is spared.\n\nThe real target of this story is a perennial problem in the human soul, self-righteousness, which is itself the degenerate outgrowth of something otherwise extremely valuable: a desire to be in the right. The problem is that being in the right in some areas has a fateful tendency to lead us to see ourselves as morally blameless across our entire lives \u2013 and therefore encourages a particular mean-spiritedness and inhumanity towards those who transgress in situations where we have been good. Our impeccable position on, say, the economy, or poverty or the right way to run a household can give us grounds for viewing ourselves as morally blameless in and of ourselves \u2013 a stance from where extraordinary cruelty can follow.\n\nJesus\u2019s point is that the surest way to be kind is not to take pride in never having committed a particular kind of wrong, but rather to see that, inevitably, we too have been foolish and cruel at other moments \u2013 and to use that knowledge to foster compassion towards those whom it lies in our powers to \u2018stone\u2019. A world in which we keep our own wrongs firmly in mind becomes, paradoxically, a truly virtuous and humane place.",

      "content": "## Bourgeois Respectability\n\nSince the middle of the 17th century, starting in the Netherlands and then expanding around the continent, the educated middle classes of Europe have aspired to an ideal of sobriety and decency that has been captured by the term \u2018bourgeois respectability\u2019. Lawyers, doctors, traders and professionals of every kind have tried to distinguish themselves from the perceived decadence of aristocrats on the one hand and the permissiveness and chaos of the working classes on the other. To be a respectable bourgeois has meant having a tidy house, going to bed early, reading serious books, taking long bracing walks in cold air, teaching one\u2019s children manners, dressing well but unostentatiously and harbouring a fierce hatred of public disorder. But more than such outward details, it has also meant keeping a close eye on one\u2019s passions, never giving way to impulse or appetite, following the rules and obeying the moral code set by one\u2019s society. It means taking an extraordinary interest in maintaining an unsullied reputation and in trusting in the rectitude of public life, especially in the opinions set out by significant figures in the newspapers. At the funeral of a respectable bourgeois, one of the chief points of praise might be that the deceased led an exemplary, upright existence \u2013 and was supremely well thought of by the entire community.\n\nIt is easy to mock, but that would be to miss out on the charms of bourgeois life and the substantial achievements it has produced. It is profoundly gratifying to have a neat laundry cupboard, carefully ironed clothes and a well-arranged kitchen; to have a good name among a wide range of polite and hard-working friends and to gather at dinner time around well-prepared and nutritious meals; to have enough but not too much money \u2013 and to spend it in carefully judged amounts on objects and projects of lasting value.\n\nIn Clemens Bewer\u2019s portrait of the lawyer and civic official Johann Janssen and his family, painted in Aachen during Germany\u2019s 19th-century middle-class ascendancy, we find a celebration of the bourgeois ethos. Johann stares out in a quiet but resolute way at the viewer; this is a man sure to have sensible opinions on all legal and financial matters: he might make an excellent godfather and would know how to recommend the purchase of the right kind of solid and well-crafted dining chairs. At the end of a particularly long, hot summer day, he might take off his cravat and relax in the garden with a very small glass of locally sourced Riesling. His wife, Magdalena, looks after the children. She appears timid, sensible and entirely fulfilled by domestic tasks. The children would likely know to say please and thank you. The little one (holding her mother\u2019s hand) might be the butt of family jokes because of her habit of sometimes speaking out of turn \u2013 but by the time she turns six, these kinks will have been ironed out, and she will look forward to following her mother in heartfelt domestic devotion and good behaviour.\n\nClemens Bewer, Johann Wilhelm Janssen and His Family, 1843\n\nUnfortunately for us, bourgeois respectability is \u2013 naturally \u2013 entirely incompatible with failure. One cannot be both a respectable bourgeois and involved in a scandal, both a bourgeois and a divorcee, both a bourgeois and mentally unwell or both a bourgeois and bankrupt. Nor in the bourgeois worldview is there much room for redemption; one wouldn\u2019t work quite so hard at keeping up appearances if it were really possible to pick oneself up from a fall and begin afresh. There are codes of responsibility and accountability that cannot be bypassed. Johann Janssen would have studiously avoided us if we had failed.\n\nWhat, then, can happen to the shamed bourgeois, exiled from the garden of respectable existence?\n\nTraditionally, there has been one refuge \u2013 what has been termed \u2018bohemia\u2019. Bohemia is the opposite of, but also the logical correlate to, the bourgeois realm. In the eyes of the bourgeois, bohemia embodies everything there is to be scared about. The worst that could happen to one\u2019s child, worse than death perhaps, is that they should end up living as a bohemian, in an attic somewhere at the top of a building on the bad side of town, aspiring to write novels or plays or paint pictures, engaged to an actor, wearing unironed clothes and eating food without cutlery or even a plate. Paintings of bohemian life produced around the same time as Janssen\u2019s family portrait were meant to strike terror into bourgeois hearts \u2013 and they did.\n\nOctave Tassaert, Studio Interior, 1845\n\nContemplating these two opposing poles, we might find ourselves not overly enamoured of either. We might be put off by the narrowness and moralism of bourgeois life, but also frightened by the mess and discomforts of bohemia.\n\nIn the wake of failure, however, we would do well to hang on to the better sides of both philosophies \u2013 while leaving out the problematic ones. There is much to learn from either side; from bohemia, we gain a necessary scepticism towards public opinion, we learn not to give too much of a damn what the neighbours think and are invited to take our own ideas and inclinations more seriously \u2013 and we also learn not to equate a bad reputation with inherent shamefulness. The bohemians allow us to believe that we might fall short of society\u2019s ideals of decency and yet, at the same time, continue to have the right to live. Our name might be an object of suspicion among lawyers and doctors, but we might still have one or two things to contribute.\n\nAt the same time, from the bourgeois, we can pick up a due appreciation of order and domesticity. We can learn to take pride in a well-kept home in spite of having chaotic inner feelings and a complicated private life. Indeed, it\u2019s precisely because of these areas of confusion that we especially esteem a tidy cupboard and a well-laid table.\n\nAfter failure, we might not be accepted back into the bourgeois circle \u2013 but we are at least provided with a moment to reflect upon both the achievements and the limitations of this dominant, now-triumphant approach to life. Going forward, we can instead aspire to hold on to a carefully edited mixture of bourgeois and bohemian virtues.",

      "tags": "name, identity, deception, truth, failure",
      "content": "### Our name\n\nStarting from when we are very little, our name tends to be powerfully associated in our own minds with the seat of our true identity. Though it was only chosen by our parents \u2013 perhaps after a slightly haphazard process of deliberation \u2013 to us, as children, it can seem as if a divine force or some sagacious higher authority picked it out; as though there must be a necessary and indelible connection between who we are and what we are called. As we learn to write our name at nursery school, carefully shaping the letters in a selection of different coloured pens, we build up a connection between our name and our essential self, as symbolised by such elements as our toes, our sense of humour, the way we blink in the sun and our memories of our first seaside holiday. This will be the name that our first lovers will use, that our friends will tweak when they tease us affectionately, that we will write down on application forms for jobs and mortgages \u2026 The idea of changing this name, intentionally, in the wake of a disaster, can therefore sound as odd as attempting to alter the animal species we belong to.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the sort of people who usually change their names do so in circumstances we would hesitate to identify with: major criminals, ex-Nazis, runaway felons \u2026 Their motives for changing their names seem to be connected with outright deception and crookedness. Are we really to join the ranks of the sinister name-changers?\n\nBut before we reject the proposal definitively, we might take a moment to think about the psychology of lying. There are situations in which the act of lying should not be counted as an automatic offence. We are sometimes justified in offering a so-called white lie when the truth is at risk of being unhelpfully and gravely distorted by prevailing rigid or categorical ideas. We may lie to preserve the vital truth, through a minor act of fabrication or omission. For example, if a favourite aunt asks us if we like the cake she has baked for us, we might tell her that it\u2019s delicious, not because it is, but because the unvarnished facts about the cake would set off such an avalanche of doubts in our relative\u2019s mind that it would take the relationship further from the truth than a small deception about icing and moisture. Alternatively, we might decide to hide our religion from a new acquaintance for a while because we know that the revelation of our faith would at once close down a dialogue that is of value to us both; one day we will get around to mentioning the truth, but we need to wait for the reality of our character and the sincerity of our intentions to get across before endangering these via a small, yet sadly unavoidably explosive, fact. Sometimes, the preservation of a larger truth requires us to walk through the gate of a minor lie.\n\nBy analogy, our failure can mean that our name immediately triggers a response in other people that is genuinely unwarranted and substantially untrue to who we actually are. The name might make them think that we are about to steal their partner (because we were once involved in an adulterous scandal), or that we may try to make off with their wallet or their car keys (because we were once caught up in a tax fraud at a company we worked at twenty years before). The mention of our name will mean that our reality is at once lost and replaced by a one-dimensional caricature. We won\u2019t have a chance to share anything of what we are actually like; our new acquaintance will have fled before getting to know us was even an option. In such circumstances, we might well wonder whether it would be a good idea to change our name, so as to give us more of an opportunity for a fair hearing. Of course, in time \u2013 if an interaction deepens \u2013 we can fill people in on our life story, but only once they are in a better position to see us in a rounded way.\n\nIn many a fairy tale, a royal \u2013 burdened by the weight of expectation attached to their name \u2013 will pretend to be a commoner, not in order to manipulate, but in order to achieve a more sincere connection with others that would be impossible if their impactful title were known from the start. The royal lies in order to be more truthfully known. Our own name change will in effect be like a grimmer version of the same phenomenon. We, too, will hide who we are, not to mock or taunt, but to attempt to be sincere and true. With no egregious or criminal intentions in mind, we might well become \u2018someone else\u2019, so as to keep alive more of who and what we actually are.",

We\u2019re familiar with a search for better weather, for richer work opportunities, for greater proximity to family \u2026 But what isn\u2019t mentioned is that we might be impelled to move because we are simply too exhausted and internally weighed down \u2013 by people\u2019s stares, by the words that we know will be exchanged every time we leave a room or a shop, by the 10,000-ton \u2018story\u2019 we are invisibly dragging around behind us at every step.\n\nWhat can be appealing about another country is the sheer indifference of the population. They \u2013 blessedly \u2013 are too preoccupied with their own dramas to give a damn about us. Their newspapers \u2013 written in a language we don\u2019t understand \u2013 are filled with quite different stories; here there are other actors, politicians, business people and lovers getting in trouble in different ways. Here we can lose ourselves in the crowd. First and foremost, we are just another foreigner. The details of our story don\u2019t matter. Aside from a few exceptions, the people don\u2019t expect to get to know us; we are merely \u2018the outsider\u2019 \u2013 we stand outside of their status system and hierarchies of respect and honour.\n\nSo, finally, we can be left in peace. We can sit in a cafe with the local beverage or soup and watch an unfamiliar world go by. There will be different sorts of barbers, the people will shop in quite different ways and the streets will be filled with other aromas.\n\nIn the olden days, all that would have been needed was to go over to another valley or to the next city along. Nowadays, we may have to move a whole continent or two. We are often asked to celebrate how small the world has become; what a little village it is, thanks to our planes and technologies \u2013 but what a burden villages can be the moment there is gossip, scandal or failure. It is a true luxury that there still exist different areas in the world that care not as much for one another as they eventually will. The human mind can\u2019t hold all the defeats of every member of the species in mind at one moment; failure remains relatively local if we are fortunate. Once upon a time, we\u2019d have taken a ship to San Francisco or Sydney. With what gratitude we\u2019d have sailed past Bradley\u2019s Head to set up home in Kurraba Point, where we could admire the eucalyptus trees and the sound of spotted pardalotes; how lucky we would have been that it took six months for the London newspaper to arrive, and even then, they might leave out the more gossipy bits \u2013 or not connect the dots. How claustrophobic the internet and the plane have rendered our lives. One day, there may be different planets to head to, and we can be first in line for a trip to Pluto or for the colonisation of Neptune. We are in a strange and sad interregnum: the planet increasingly too small for failure, the universe still closed for escape. But even now, there are teeming capital cities at far ends of the globe that can provide refuge \u2013 places that we will be able to call home not because we speak the language or understand the ways, but precisely because we will be total aliens and because in such obscurity who we really are has a chance to emerge, shielded from the constant stares and violent hatreds of our native villages.",

After failure, the requirements get a lot stricter. What we need first and foremost are people who will not judge, who will not moralise and who will know how to forgive.\n\nThere is no single route down which the human mind must go in order to reach this psychological sweet spot, but it\u2019s possible to suggest a likely trajectory. Fundamentally, to accept failure, a person has to have experienced grave suffering at the hands of the dominant societal hierarchy. Something needs to have loosened them from, or rendered them suspicious of, the prevailing status system.\n\nMaybe, at a young age, their particular sort of intelligence was not recognised by the school system. They therefore know intuitively what it is like to be labelled a failure \u2013 and how unfairly the tag can be applied. Or perhaps they were at odds with a parent who bullied them or made them feel small for not performing well according to measures that were ultimately arbitrary and disconnected from who they were. Perhaps their sexuality set them at odds with the popular ideals of their communities; they knew that their tastes meant that they could never be simply \u2018ordinary\u2019 and lightly accepted. Or, more likely and ideally still, they are people who have themselves slipped up and been exposed. They have known what it is like to wake up one day and have a damning crowd outside the door, to have the internet in flames against them, to be shown the office door after a terse meeting with the boss or to be cast aside by family and abandoned by their social circle. The friends one makes after failure will be those who are fully inducted into the meanness of the human heart. They will have suffered unbearably, been ostracised and judged. They will have spent time sobbing in lonely bedrooms.\n\nMost of us mean to be kind, but we are never punished long or hard enough actually to become so. In the end, ex-prisoners are probably some of the greatest sorts of new friend we can make. There is no more broad-minded set of people on Earth. Their experience wears down all self-satisfaction and arrogance; they are devoid of pride and at the same time, utterly able to recognise our own hunger for sympathy. Maybe at one point they robbed banks or drove getaway cars, but they have the qualities (so long as they are no longer actively involved in crime) to be the gentlest and most imaginative friends. It takes someone who has lost contact with their family and been disowned by their social circle to really understand love. There is no point seeking out \u2018good people\u2019 among the blameless and the innocent. We need to nourish our hunger for friendship from richer, more potent sources.\n\nOnce we are ready for friendship after a failure, we would do well to seek out ex-burglars and ex-con artists, ex-hijackers and ex-tax evaders. There should be groups specifically focused on connecting those who have failed with this vibrant, redemptive sort of community. Their souls \u2013 if we are lucky \u2013 will be ready to receive and honour our own distinctive needs for charity.",

      "content": "### Love life\n\nFailure is a cleansing agent for relationships. It is ruthless with all but the most solid bonds; it gets rid of all but the most sincere. Failure works out what love is worth keeping \u2013 and ensures that other varieties are extinguished in short order. It won\u2019t tolerate simulacrums of love \u2013 the flattery that can pass for it, or the sentimental attachment or unfocused crush.\n\nThere are plenty of apparently viable unions that can, in benevolent times, go on forever \u2013 out of habit, a longing for security or a fear of what the neighbours would think. But once there is shocking failure \u2013 once the neighbours are mocking anyway, once our craving for tenderness reaches a pitch, once we lose any hesitation about asking for hugs and caresses, once we are crying like small children and don\u2019t mind saying what is actually on our minds \u2013 we quickly see which love is worth preserving and which never merited the name in the first place.\n\nThe partner who might have stayed with us out of convenience or because \u2013 for a long time \u2013 we were a handy route to money and status, will hardly make a protest (or only a tiny one, in order to preserve their own dignity). They will let us go soon enough; they never signed up to a mess, they never thought they would be asked to care without much hope of reward (except for thoughtful gratitude). They understood love as being with someone who could shore them up and make them feel better. It wasn\u2019t about nailing themselves to a loser.\n\nIt would be better to keep such criteria in mind from the beginning of any future dating process. We should ask ourselves: is this a person who would stay by me when everyone else is laughing, who wouldn\u2019t run away if I had no more money, who would stick around if I had enemies or was driven off to jail \u2026? These are not normal questions to wonder about on a first date \u2013 we\u2019re meant to look into their eyes and wonder about their job prospects \u2013 but they are the qualities we should turn over in our minds given the role of fate and the presence of our hamartia. We are not looking for dumb or uncritical loyalty; what we aspire to is a sort of love that recognises us in our totality and respects the workings of fortune \u2013 and is therefore slower to judge or to flee.\n\nIn honour of these concerns, we might, on a future date, ask our partner: \u2018And how might you feel about waiting for me until I end a prison term?\u2019 Most would immediately look horrified and run away. A few will smile and utter a gentle \u2018but of course\u2019 \u2013 and we\u2019ll know then never to let them go.\n\nThe solace that these types of people can bring us is beyond compare. When failure strikes, they will compensate for the love of the whole world. One person\u2019s close and attentive ministration can truly make up for the unsteady adulation and eventual cruel condemnation of millions. It won\u2019t matter very much at all that we are ridiculed by strangers, if we are taken seriously by the one person we esteem in our own home. We\u2019ll know exactly what Shakespeare meant in his \u2018Sonnet 29\u2019, even if not every word makes it through from his Elizabethan English to our own:\n\nWhen, in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,\n\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\n\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\n\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\n\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\n\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\n\nDesiring this man\u2019s art and that man\u2019s scope,\n\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\n\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\n\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\n\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\n\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate;\n\nFor thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings\n\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\nWith this very particular sort of lover in our lives, the sort that would wait outside the prison gates for us, we\u2019ll finally be in a position to understand love. We\u2019ll know that kings \u2013 or more realistically, celebrities and tech millionaires \u2013 don\u2019t have anything on us and that, despite the mess we have made of our lives, we are the luckiest people on the Earth.",

      "content": "### Jobs\n\nAfter a downfall, what are we to do with ourselves workwise? If we can get another job, what sort of job should it be?\n\nUsually, in even the noblest minds and most virtuous professions, work is seldom without a degree of vanity. A doctor wants to help their patients, for sure, but they are also quietly pleased when they are noticed doing so by prestigious eyes. A charity worker is concerned with the war-torn country they are helping, but they are forthright when asking for a raise as well. Most jobs allow workers to engineer moments when they can be admired and acclaimed slightly more than would be warranted by the strict needs of the job itself.\n\nThis, of course, is impossible \u2013 and sickening \u2013 for those who have failed. When we have suffered a downfall, we see work not as a place to stand out, but instead to disappear. Hopes of personal glory are firmly behind us. What we want to be subsumed by is something very distinctive and very wise: problems far larger than our own. As failed people, we are likely to be in the market for the enormous problems of other people; we want to work long and hard at something very serious that leaves no room either for showing off or for thinking of ourselves. We need to find difficulties so urgent, so ghastly, so serious, so indisputably critical that we will \u2013 while attending to them \u2013 be able to forget who we are and what has happened to us. It really won\u2019t matter that we were sacked or disgraced or humiliated when a house is on fire, when one of the patients in a hospice needs a defibrillator, when we have to get an ambulance up a hillside to rescue a stricken child, when we\u2019re trying to alleviate malaria in an under-nourished population in a war-ravaged country or when we are assisting on a ward filled with people who are seeking to take their own lives.\n\nSuch work will leave us feeling exhausted, rocked to the core and sometimes traumatised \u2013 but what it will not do is remind us of what we have lost and how much fashionable society once respected us. Indeed, every day, it will only serve to highlight what we still have to appreciate. We may have destroyed our good name and be the laughing stock in our old community, but we can still lay claim to relative good health, our minds still function more or less and we have enough money for food and shelter. Our job can help us to pulverise the ego and provide round-the-clock opportunities for gratitude.\n\nOur new kind of work should ideally also enable us to access a feeling that, in other circumstances, we would have lost entirely: the sense that we can make a positive difference to others\u2019 lives. Of late, we might only have experienced our power to mess everything up. We will have been an exceptional problem to those around us: upsetting friends and family, letting down colleagues, shocking strangers. Our very presence has been offensive to so many. But thanks to a certain sort of job, we can \u2013 in a limited way \u2013 feel that we are the sort of person that others can call upon for help. It may be a relatively minor intervention, but we can bring water to a cancer patient in a hospice, teach a child how to do their times tables or calm down a suicidal patient in a clinic for troubled teenagers. It really doesn\u2019t matter if the job pays very much and we certainly won\u2019t care if anyone in the wider world knows that we\u2019re doing it; it will offer something infinitely more important than prestige or material reward: a feeling that there\u2019s a reason for us to keep existing.\n\nWe are used to career services that tend to the needs of the young. What we need is an alternative service specifically geared to the needs of the failed. Such a career service would take stock of our disaster and try to determine our particular areas of competence and interest. Then it would attempt to match us with an urgent societal problem commensurate in scale with our woes.\n\nA supreme example of an inspiring career adjustment in the wake of failure lies in the life of the British Conservative politician and War Secretary John Profumo, who in June 1963 \u2013 at the age of 48 and after a hugely successful career in the military and in the senior ranks of government \u2013 had to resign after being caught in an affair with a 19-year-old model, Christine Keeler \u2013 an affair which had endangered national security and led him to lie to the Prime Minister, the security services and the House of Commons.\n\nA more complete fall from grace had scarcely ever visited a British politician. Profumo had no hope of returning to his previous life. He was a national disgrace and the subject of taunts and mockery. Rotten eggs were thrown at his car. He had let lust blind him to his responsibilities to his family, his party and his country. For a few months he was entirely despondent. Then, in early 1964, seven months after his resignation, Profumo wrote a letter to Walter Birmingham, who ran Toynbee Hall, a centre for disadvantaged people in Whitechapel, one of the most economically depressed parts of East London. Profumo asked if he could possibly be of any help, even perhaps cleaning the toilets (this was a man who had, a year before, held one of the great offices of state). Birmingham had a noble heart and a keen sense of how people could turn their lives around, whether they were kids just out of prison or a disgraced Conservative minister. So he wrote back to Profumo and asked him to come and see him. The letter saved Profumo\u2019s life. Suddenly, he had a mission to solve problems far larger and more desperate than his own.\n\nThe disgraced politician threw himself into his work. He did everything from cleaning to reforming the management structure of the organisation to raising funds for new initiatives. He became an exemplary employee \u2013 never complaining, never alluding to his past and treating everyone with exceptional grace and kindness. His ego had disappeared in the heat of his scandal. All he wished to do was serve. Paradoxically, so well did he serve, so uncomplaining was his approach, so uninterested was he in himself, that his example attracted notice from former friends and enemies in politics. In 1975, after multiple recommendations, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. In 1995, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a 70th birthday party at which she sat Profumo next to the Queen. When he died, the lawyer and social reformer Lord Longford remarked that he \u2018felt more admiration [for Profumo] than [for] all the men I\u2019ve known in my lifetime\u2019.\n\nA lesson we can all take from Profumo\u2019s life is that he wisely did not attempt a \u2018comeback.\u2019 He understood that living quietly for a few years before attempting a return to politics would symbolise a refusal to understand his guilt and a rejection of the opportunities that his downfall had afforded for him: to overcome vanity and to open his heart to the needs of ordinary, desperate people that he had hitherto ignored.\n\nAfter our own downfalls, we should bring some of Profumo\u2019s humility and acumen to bear on our destroyed lives. We will need to ask ourselves where our particular passions happen to lie \u2013 and how we can connect them up with urgent real-world problems. The answers won\u2019t always involve working with poverty in a capital city. Our vocation might be to help blind children to learn to read, or to assist recently arrived refugees, or to tend to elderly prisoners who have been released after serving lengthy terms for sex crimes.\n\nHowever hard our eventual work will be, it will be doing us the greatest favour: it will show us that we still have a role to play and help us to see that our suffering is neither unique nor uniquely awful. We will hardly need to ask about salaries. Our chief enquiry in interviews will simply be: \u2018How great is their pain?

      "content": "### Retreat to a hut\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of traditional Chinese culture is the dignified recognition that there might come a time when, for reasons eminently worthy of respect, we will need to leave town and go and live in a hut on a hillside somewhere far away.\n\nIn premodern China, it was well understood that politics and public life were a treacherous and unsteady business. Reputations could quickly be made and just as quickly unmade. Rumours might arbitrarily surround a person and render all further public service impossible. One was permanently at risk of falling foul of court factions, of the machinations of enemies, of economic cycles and of military defeats. To expect to lead a long life and not to fail was contrary to any intelligent or subtle understanding of how the universe worked. Good people could \u2013 and should \u2013 expect to fail, suddenly and definitively.\n\nThe question was what might happen next. Chinese culture did not see failure as the end of the story: they were as interested in its consequences as they were in those of success. They understood a need to limit the anxiety that might emerge from a rigidly meritocratic worldview \u2013 and the solution they arrived at was the concept of an honourable retreat to a hut. There was room in the Chinese imagination for what were known as yinshi (hidden men), yimin (disengaged people) and chushi (scholars-at-home). These were terms of great affection and esteem for people who had left imperial Beijing and other centres of power, who no longer occupied any prominent place in the social hierarchy, but who still retained a solid claim to honour and respect. These \u2018disengaged\u2019 people could go into the mountains, build themselves small dwellings and then devote themselves to the observation of nature, to the writing of poetry and to the contemplation of the great sacred Buddhist texts. There was understood to be nothing squalid or shameful about their materially modest lives. They had not failed because they were \u2018bad\u2019, but because the way the world was structured meant for constant ebbs and flows of power and influence.\n\nIn China\u2019s Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), government and politics became especially turbulent and prey to arbitrary reversals \u2013 and it was at this point in particular that Chinese poets and artists celebrated the idea of a retreat to a hut. In exquisite paintings by great artists like Xiang Shengmo (1597\u20131658) or Tang Yin (1470\u2013 1524)(see overleaf), we find inviting depictions of rural lives \u2013 huts that seem to truly compensate for an alienation from the glamour of the city. In valleys shrouded in mist we see yinshi living in beautiful, small wooden houses, often near a stream or by a lake. There are birds overhead, neatly tended gardens and inside the huts, perhaps a scroll with a Buddhist inscription about the futility of all worldly goods or the necessary dissolution of the ego. The once-powerful official is dressed simply but elegantly, usually cross-legged, contemplating the sky or reading a book, fully reconciled to his new existence.\n\nWe have made it unbearably hard for ourselves to fail because we have \u2013 collectively \u2013 been so reluctant to imagine what dignified failure might look like. We quite literally don\u2019t know what to do with the failures in our society. We have nowhere for them to go. We don\u2019t give them hillsides and huts and Buddhist texts \u2013 we expect them to disappear and not spoil our success-oriented vistas.\n\nThe Ming Chinese, infinitely wiser in this regard, knew how to budget for failure from the outset. They gave failure a place in their art because they had accepted it as a legitimate occurrence in their lives.\n\nWhen we fail, we may not need to live in an actual hut. It\u2019s what the hut stands for that counts: the acceptance of a life that is simultaneously modest and secluded \u2013 as well as dignified and unworthy of contempt. Our hut might be on a hillside in southern Andalusia or in a valley in Sicily or a desert in northern Texas. Or it might just be a place in our minds \u2013 a place we can retreat to and enjoy peace without self-hatred.\n\nXiang Shengmo, Reading in the Autumn Forest, 1623\n\nTang Yin, Thatched Cottage in the Western Mountains, c. 1499\u20131520",

      "content": "### Our children\n\nWe believe \u2013 perhaps understandably \u2013 that one of the central requirements of being a good parent is to not, at any cost, visibly fail. We undertake enormous efforts to hide our vulnerability to error, foolishness and disaster. We don\u2019t tell our children about the tensions at work and our fear of being sacked; we don\u2019t reveal how difficult our relationship is and how often we feel defeated and alone; we don\u2019t mention to them that we are afflicted by compulsions and addictions that we can\u2019t overcome. We hold that a good parent must appear at all times serene, composed, knowledgeable and wise.\n\nThese moves are certainly well meant and easy to sympathise with. But in extremis, they also do our children a grave injustice. The task of a parent isn\u2019t to shelter a child from all failure, but to induct them into the likelihood of mess-ups with reassurance, intelligence and love \u2013 to teach them that failure belongs to everyone and that it is possible to be at once kind, clever, idiotic and uncontrolled.\n\nThough we may hope to insulate our children from our failures, the likelihood is that they will sense their presence anyway \u2013 but without the help of commentary or honesty. They will sense our depression and anxiety. They will know that something is up over the dinner table. They will have an intuition that there is trouble. The risk is that unless we are open about what is actually happening, they will do what children who are witness to difficulty always do: blame themselves. They will see their depressed and silent father or anxious and irritable mother and come to the most tempting \u2013 and in their eyes, logical \u2013 conclusion: that they themselves must be wicked, that they must have done something wrong, that they stand in error.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if we have truly fooled them skilfully, the danger also opens up that our children will start to feel painfully unique in the extent of their own failures and errors. In the context of their lives, they know well enough about their own greed, their own irritability, their own meanness, their own impulsiveness \u2013 and yet when they see no correlates for these troubling patterns in the people they admire most, they end up feeling guilty and unique. It seems that their beloved parents don\u2019t share in any of their frailties. We are seemingly only ever even-tempered, generous and thoughtful. The child then starts to feel exceptionally bad \u2013 in relation to people doing too well at pretending to be completely good.\n\nWe do our children an enormous favour when we are able to fail in front of them, unambiguously and with a measure of calming commentary; if we can take them aside and share with them our actual circumstances: that we have been passed over for promotion, that we have stupidly lost some money in an ill-advised scheme, that we\u2019re finding it difficult to control our appetites or our temper. They know the problems anyway, in the vague but clever way that children do, but what an immense relief it will be for them to find an explanation for their intuitions in our own patient words. No child needs a perfect parent; they need a parent who feels real, who can be honest, who doesn\u2019t blame them \u2013 and who knows how to say sorry when they need to.\n\nOur confession will help them to recognise that their parent is something far better than perfect \u2013 they are human, as they themselves are. The candid admission of failure allows a child to extend sympathy and compassion. Their parent isn\u2019t angry with them, isn\u2019t depressed because of something they did, isn\u2019t mean or mysteriously vengeful; they are merely self-disgusted, self-hating and utterly confused.\n\nIt might seem like a disorienting concept for a child, but it is far less so than a disguised failure who only serves to alienate them from reality and to deny them the right to truthful explanations. A child would far prefer to know that a parent is in trouble than to fear that the problem lies only with them.\n\nA parent who fails is giving a child a gift of sorts. They allow them to discover that failure is part of every life. They\u2019re offering their child something more important than an unblemished childhood: a sincere one, and an induction into how to approach their own darker sides, which they will come across soon enough. By being perfect, a parent is not being perfect; they\u2019re making the child feel ashamed of a proclivity to failure that should be recognised as properly universal.",

After this, a voice would come from the other side of a curtain or grille, reframing the event, placing it within the context of divine love, sympathising but also admonishing \u2013 and ending by offering a road to redemption.\n\nIn our rush to build a more reasonable, secular world, we have not known how to replace this practice, the function of which has in fact nothing to do with the supernatural but belongs squarely within the requirements of ordinary psychology and civic life. Instead, we have the law, which seeks earthly justice and hands out punishment to transgressors, but proceeds in an implacable way that merely leads most of the accused to deny what they have done and hate those who have asked them to take responsibility. From the legal standpoint, there is no attempt to address the soul of the perpetrator; the idea is chiefly to keep the streets safe and appease the public\u2019s hunger for vengeance. How different this is from the Christian approach, which assumes that everyone is a sinner from the outset, insists that everyone routinely errs, and which therefore offers forgiveness for all those courageous enough to examine their consciences and atone with requisite humility.\n\nInstead, the modern world offers up \u2013 through the instrument of the media \u2013 a version of the old-fashioned pillory, where transgressors are lampooned, where it is automatically assumed that those who did wrong meant to do so and where there is no mercy or sympathy on offer \u2013 and therefore, again, no incentive for honesty or confession. Public shaming has \u2013 absurdly \u2013 become the sole instrument of moral improvement. What would a more psychologically rich processing of error look like? We can imagine the following stages.",

In order to quell these, it is important to stress a fact that is unfashionable, but that has been considered throughout this book: that messing up is an intrinsic feature of our make-up. For Catholics, this proclivity was once classed under the title of \u2018original sin\u2019 (see page 33). According to St Augustine\u2019s explanation, we are all the descendants of Adam and Eve \u2013 those two early transgressors from God\u2019s laws \u2013 and therefore indelibly tainted with a temptation to do wrong. Sinning is not some individual freakish occurrence; it is what our species is hard-wired to do.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to believe in the Biblical truth of this concept to recognise its applicability at moments of crushing self-blame: seeing ourselves as belonging to a species that continually messes up helps to alleviate the devastating shame that can render true atonement impossible. We can chastise ourselves, but before we give way to an impulse to harm ourselves, we should remember that what has befallen us fits into a wider scenario of human frailty.

We aren\u2019t just brutes or fools; we are wounded and have been for a long time. There will be reasons why we acted as we did \u2013 and in a certain mood, we can see the logic of our illness and feel sorry that it should have had such a powerful grip on us.\n\nUnlike what is routinely assumed, we can both take responsibility for our actions and have a measure of broad-minded sympathy for why we perpetrated them.

They would as gladly take nourishment from a convicted felon as they would from a prince or a reigning pop star.

      "content": "## The Downfall of Oscar Wilde\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day in 1895 at the St James\u2019s Theatre in London, the most famous playwright in the English-speaking world at the time, Oscar Wilde, presented his new play, The Importance of Being Earnest. The audience was packed with celebrities, aristocrats and famous politicians, eagerly awaiting another triumph from a man universally heralded as a genius. At the end of the performance, there was a standing ovation. Critics adored the play and so did audiences, making it Wilde\u2019s fourth major success in only three years.\n\nYet, only a few short months later, Wilde was bankrupt and about to be imprisoned. His reputation was in tatters and his life ruined beyond repair. It was, as everyone then and now agreed, a tragedy; the swift fall of a great man due to a small but fateful slip.\n\nThe story of how Oscar Wilde went from celebrity playwright to prisoner in such a short space of time has much to teach us about disgrace and infamy. We don\u2019t have to be similarly lauded to understand that Wilde\u2019s poignant tragedy urges us to abandon our normal moralism and have sympathy for those who stray. It calls for us to extend our love not just to those who obviously deserve it, but precisely to those who seem not to. We talk a lot about what a civilised world should be like, but we might put it like this: a civilised world would be one in which Oscar Wilde could have been forgiven \u2013 and in which those who make errors of judgement could be treated with high degrees of sympathy and, even, of kindness. It would be a world in which we could remember that good people can at times do bad things \u2013 and should not pay an eternal price for them.\n\nWilde\u2019s tragedy began when he was introduced to a beguiling young man named Lord Alfred Douglas. Douglas, known to family and friends as \u2018Bosie\u2019, was extremely handsome, charming and arrogant. He enjoyed gambling, spent money carelessly and was prone to outbursts of anger as well as moments of great intellectual insight.\n\nBy 1892, a year after they had met, the two men had fallen profoundly in love. Although Wilde was married with two children, he spent much of his time with Bosie. There was a sixteen-year age gap: Douglas was 24, Wilde 40. They travelled together, stayed in hotels and hosted large dinners for their friends.\n\nTheir relationship was tempestuous, but Wilde was ineluctably drawn to the younger man. \u2018It is really absurd,\u2019 he wrote to him in one love letter, \u2018I can\u2019t live without you.\u2019 By 1894, the pair were constantly seen together in public and rumours of their love affair had spread as far as Bosie\u2019s father, the Marquess of Queensbury. The Marquess was a cruel, aggressive character, known for inventing the \u2018Queensbury Rules\u2019 of amateur boxing. Having decided that Wilde was corrupting his son, he demanded that the pair stop seeing each other. When Wilde refused, Queensbury began to hound him across London, threatening violence against restaurant and hotel managers if they allowed Wilde and Bosie onto the premises. Queensbury booked a seat for the opening night of The Importance of Being Earnest. He planned to throw a bouquet of rotting vegetables at Wilde when he took to the stage. When Wilde heard about the stunt, he had him barred from the theatre and Queensbury flew into a rage. He tried to accost Wilde after the performance at the Albemarle Club in Mayfair. When the porters refused to let him in, he left a calling card that publicly accused Wilde of having sex with other men.\n\nSince homosexuality was illegal and deeply frowned upon in Victorian society and its mass media, it was a dangerous accusation. Seeing no end to Queensbury\u2019s bullying behaviour, Wilde decided to take legal action. By suing Queensbury for libel, Wilde hoped to clear his name and put an end to the harassment. Friends begged him to drop the case, certain that he would lose, but Bosie insisted that he go ahead with it so that they might be vindicated and be able to live without censorship.\n\nWhen the trial began, Wilde was confident. He took the stand and gave witty, distracting answers during his cross-examination. Within a few days, however, the tide had turned against him. In the opening speech for the defence, Queensbury\u2019s barrister announced that they had several witnesses: young men whom Wilde had entertained in his room at the Savoy Hotel, and who would testify that Wilde had paid them for sex.\n\nIt became clear that Queensbury\u2019s lawyers had hired private detectives to uncover an uncomfortable truth: that both Wilde and Bosie had hired male prostitutes. Some had even blackmailed Wilde in the past, successfully extorting money from him in return for their silence. The trial was hopeless, and Wilde withdrew his case, but events had spiralled beyond his control. Queensbury\u2019s lawyers forwarded their evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions and Wilde was soon arrested on charges of gross indecency. The legal costs left him bankrupt and theatres were forced to abandon his plays.\n\nWilde\u2019s criminal trial began at the Old Bailey on 26th April 1895. He faced twenty-five charges, all of which surrounded his sexual relationships with younger men. Wilde continued to deny the allegations and the jury could not reach a verdict, but when the prosecution was allowed to try Wilde a second time, he was eventually found guilty. It was rumoured that the then prime minister, Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, had also had an affair with one of Queensbury\u2019s sons and so pushed for Wilde to be convicted in order to keep his own secret hidden. The judge said at his sentencing, \u2018It is the worst case I have ever tried. \u2026 I shall pass the severest sentence that the law allows. In my judgment it is totally inadequate for such a case as this.\u2019\n\nWilde was sentenced to two years of hard labour. Inmates in London\u2019s Pentonville Prison, where he was sent, spent six hours a day walking on a heavy treadmill or untangling old rope using their hands and knees. For someone from Wilde\u2019s luxurious background, it was an impossible hardship. His bed was a hard plank, which made it difficult to fall asleep. Prisoners were kept alone in their cells and barred from talking to one another. He suffered from dysentery and became physically very frail.\n\nAfter six months, Wilde was transferred to Reading Gaol. As he stood on the central platform of Clapham Junction, with handcuffs around his wrists, passers-by began to recognise the celebrity playwright. They laughed and mocked. Some even spat at him. \u2018For half an hour I stood there,\u2019 he wrote afterwards, \u2018in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob. For a year after that was done to me, I wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time.\u2019\n\nDuring his last year in prison, he wrote an anguished essay, De Profundis: \u2018I, once a lord of language, have no words in which to express my anguish and my shame. \u2026 Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still. \u2026 The gods had given me almost everything. But I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease. \u2026 I allowed pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace. There is only one thing for me now, absolute humility. \u2026 I have lain in prison for nearly two years. \u2026 I have passed through every possible mood of suffering. \u2026 The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.\u2019\n\nIn May 1897, Wilde was finally released. He set sail for Dieppe in France the very same day. His wife, Constance, had changed her name and moved abroad with their two sons, Vyvyan (now 11) and Cyril (12). Wilde would never see his children again; he missed them every day. Constance agreed to send him money on the condition that he end his relationship with Bosie, but only a few months later the pair reunited and the money stopped. They moved to Naples and Wilde began using the name Sebastian Melmoth, inspired by the great Christian martyr St Sebastian and a character from a Gothic novel, Melmoth the Wanderer, who had sold his soul to the devil.\n\nWilde and Bosie hoped to find privacy abroad, but the scandal seemed to follow them wherever they went. English patrons recognised them in hotels and demanded they be turned away. After Constance stopped sending money, Bosie\u2019s mother offered to pay their debts if he returned home and the pair once again parted ways. Scorned by many of his former friends, Wilde moved to Paris, where he lived in relative poverty. He spent most of his time and money in bars and cafes, borrowing funds whenever he could and drinking heavily. His weight ballooned and his conversation dragged. He was slowly inebriating himself to death. When a friend suggested he try to write another comic play, he replied: \u2018I have lost the mainspring of life and art \u2026 I have pleasures, and passions, but the joy of life is gone.\u2019\n\nWilde\u2019s final piece of writing, a poem entitled \u2018The Ballad of Reading Gaol\u2019, was published in 1898. The author\u2019s name was listed as \u2018C.3.3.\u2019 \u2013 Wilde\u2019s cell block and cell number from his time in the prison. Towards the end of 1900, Wilde developed meningitis and became gravely ill. A Catholic priest visited his hotel and baptised him into the church. He died the following day at the age of 46.\n\nMore than a century later, in 2017, a law was passed to exonerate those who had been convicted due to their sexuality and Oscar Wilde received an official pardon from the UK government. \u2018It is hugely important,\u2019 declared a government minister, \u2018that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today.\u2019\n\nOur society has become generous towards Wilde\u2019s specific behaviour \u2013 but it remains intransigently moralistic towards a huge number of other errors and transgressions; we need only read the newspaper to be reminded of the cruelty. The crowd continues to enjoy watching people be disgraced (to appease some unhappiness in their own hearts), refusing to see the humanity in those whom it likes to call \u2018monsters\u2019. Many of us would want to reach out across the ages to comfort and befriend Oscar Wilde. It\u2019s a touching hope, but this feeling would be better employed in extending love and sympathy to all those figures who are right now facing ruin and disgrace, who cry out for our love and sympathy and beg us not to judge them too harshly or spit on them too callously on their way to jail. That would be true civilisation and a world in which Wilde\u2019s horrifying downfall had not been in vain.",

We\u2019ll joke about despair and terror: we\u2019ll become practitioners of \u2018gallows humour\u2019. Mostly, the jokes we make will be at our own expense. There will be so much in our lives that people think is too sad to mention: that almost all our friends have ditched us, that our name is all over the internet, that our children don\u2019t speak to us. The normal response in these cases is usually to skirt the issue. One can fall prey to the vain superstition that if one doesn\u2019t bring up an unfortunate fact, it might just fade away of its own accord. But not mentioning sadness is also what lets it win its sapping victories over us. We suffocate from timidity around our griefs. The strategy of gallows humour is different; it is usefully and gloriously defiant. It insists on mentioning the grim aspects of life and our situations, asserting control over them through mordant, dry commentary. In the Middle Ages, a tradition began in which the condemned, standing on the scaffold before their demise, would turn to the crowd and make a witticism about their situation. Sigmund Freud recounts a man being led out to be hung at dawn saying, \u2018Well, the day is certainly starting well.\u2019 Gallows humour is not squeamish about looking bleakness straight in the eye. Rather than being slowly gnawed at by sideways glances at the truth, the gallows humourist insists that they will not be silenced by it \u2013 they roll their sleeves up and grab it tenaciously. In these circumstances, laughter becomes a kind of grateful relief at witnessing our most shameful secrets handled with such reassuringly confident sangfroid. We might cheerfully exclaim: \u2018In the days when I wasn\u2019t thought worse than Adolf H. \u2026\u2019 or, \u2018Being alive is still marginally better than being dead, but it\u2019s a close-run thing \u2026\u2019 Gallows humour resists the temptation to complain earnestly. By frankly referring to something appalling, we can bolster our capacity not to be crushed by it. We don\u2019t need to be great comics to generate gallows humour. The technique follows a simple pattern: we just need to head directly for the saddest, most taboo sides of our failed lives, remain utterly unflinching in front of them \u2013 and deliver understated, breezy, unruffled responses. Gallows humour edges the worst facts of our lives into a zone of bearable conversation. It allows us to joke about what we could otherwise never say straight out. It is a technique to stop us being destroyed by silence.",

Because of this, they naturally aren\u2019t in a position to extend sympathy to those who have failed in these areas; those people must simply be idiots or reprobates \u2013 human in a technical sense, but not creatures with any humanity worth honouring. The moralists who think this way aren\u2019t so much unkind as unimaginative. Experience of failure offers a crash course in how decent people (that is, all of us from a sufficient distance) might end up in an appalling place \u2013 a lesson that becomes applicable across all areas of mishap. Once we have failed, we can feel pain from the inside. Suffering of all kinds becomes our area of expertise; all distress becomes relatable (how unkind are people who have been happy all their lives). We can picture just what it might be like to have a painful hip as a 90-year-old or to have been told off for eating too many sweets as a 4-year-old \u2013 even to be a sparrow that has lost its way home or a squirrel longing for nuts in midwinter. When we read the paper, every unfortunate \u2018cheater\u2019 or \u2018reject\u2019 is someone whose story we can understand and empathise with.

This might indicate that we must therefore be \u2018bad\u2019, but the reality is more complicated. Ironically, people who are genuinely good \u2013 people who know about kindness, patience, forgiveness, compromise, apology and gentleness \u2013 always suspect that they aren\u2019t very good. It seems one cannot both be a good person and at the same time feel blameless or pure inside. Goodness is, one might say, the unique consequence of a keen and ongoing awareness of one\u2019s capacity to be bad \u2013 that is, to be thoughtless, foolish, cruel, self-righteous and ignorant of the legitimate needs of others. Only on the basis of a perpetual, vigilant impression that one hasn\u2019t got the right to judge oneself above suspicion does one come anywhere near the ethical high standard that merits the title of \u2018good\u2019. The price of being genuinely good is the constant idea that one might be a monster \u2013 combined with a fundamental hesitation about labelling anyone else monstrous. A guilty conscience is the bedrock of virtue \u2013 and all this comes easily to the failed.\n\nGenerally, it never occurs to the most difficult or dangerous people on the planet that they might be lacking. Their sickness is to locate evil always firmly outside of themselves: it\u2019s invariably the \u2018others\u2019 who are to blame, the others who are cruel, sinful, lacking in judgement and mistaken. Their job is to take these impure people down and correct their evils in the fire of their own righteousness. The failed don\u2019t go in for this. Their sense of uncleanliness is an insurance policy against further evil. It is a grim paradox, therefore, that some of the worst deeds that humans have ever been guilty of have been carried out by people with an easy conscience; people who felt they were definitely on the side of angels, people who were entirely sure that they had justice in hand. What unites the people who report their neighbours to the secret police, the crowds who burn their victims at stakes while dancing around their agonised bodies, the government officials who set up purification camps and the nations that wipe out their enemies with special barbarism is their consistent and overwhelming sense that they are doing the right thing \u2013 in the eyes of God, history or truth. When trying to understand why people do evil things, we should never start from the position that they understood them as evil; they carried out their nastiness cocksure that they were paragons. An impassioned feeling of being the instrument of justice has been at the heart of humanity\u2019s most appallingly unkind moments. The truly kind ones among us always readily forgive because they know how much in them needs to be forgiven.",

The drawbacks of both options are well known. The first has a habit of leaving us feeling abandoned, the second stifled and restless. We\u2019re in danger of either longing for company or wishing that we weren\u2019t stuck expecting one other person to fulfil all our emotional and practical needs \u2013 and, with even the best intentions, generally failing to do so.\n\nWhen life is going well enough in other areas, the frustrations are almost bearable. But when everything has been lost, desperation may inspire us to try to find something that can shore us up. This is when an unfamiliar option may start to sound oddly appealing: to live communally in close proximity to other people who have failed.\n\nA community of failed people promises to solve the problems of both loneliness and judgement. In such a place, we will be surrounded by others, but others who will not moralise, sneer or cut us dead. We will be in a \u2018family\u2019 bonded by a vital glue: our joint experience of condemnation and shame.\n\nThe failure doesn\u2019t have to be identical. Maybe one person ran off with some money, another was in a sex scandal and a third lost their job because of their problem with anxiety. What will unite this diverse set of characters is that they all know the toll of having to live in a society where, even if they don\u2019t mean to, others constantly enforce the message that they are strange, rare, pitiable or devilish.\n\nIn an ideal community of the failed, life would feel lighter and more liberated because there would be no need to interact with harsh witnesses every day. Chores and routine tasks could be shared out in common: there would be failed people doing the cooking and failed people taking care of the laundry; failed people tending to the vegetable garden and failed people repairing the roof after a storm. It might take place in a simple but beautiful house somewhere out in nature, very far from other people, with the ability to live cheaply and self-sufficiently.\n\nOne could hope for an atmosphere of vivid kindness, because everyone in the group would be so familiar with the ravages of self-disgust. Members would encourage one another to keep going, not to lapse into despair and to have faith that black moods will pass. There would be moments of joint confession and atonement.\n\nCollectively, we\u2019ve been good at dreaming up where cheerful, beautiful people should go. Resorts the world over lend a sense of community to buoyant families and ardent lovers. We know, too, how to lock up people in terrifying prisons and throw away the keys. What we haven\u2019t yet found our way to is the building of communities for people who have failed \u2013 for those who have surrendered their pride, who are no longer interested in one-upmanship, who are profoundly aware of their flaws and are committed to battling them \u2026 a community of those who recognise that the kindness of others stands as the central reason to remain alive.\n\nIn this community, we would not be able to erase our failures, but we would be able to attenuate a great many of their secondary, aggravating characteristics. We would have ruined our lives without losing all experience of kindness and companionship.",

      "content": "## Losers as Winners\n\nOur society has an advanced tendency to label certain people as \u2018winners\u2019 and others \u2013 logically enough \u2013 \u2018losers\u2019. Aside from the evident meanness of this categorisation, the underlying problem with it is the suggestion that life might be a unitary, singular race, at the conclusion to which one could neatly rank all the competitors from highest to lowest.\n\nThe more confusing and complex truth is that life is really made up of a number of races that unfold simultaneously over very different terrain and with different sorts of cups and medals in view. There are races for money, fame and prestige, of course \u2013 and these attract many spectators and, in some social circles, the bulk of the coverage. But there are also races that measure other kinds of prowess worth venerating. There is a race for who can remain calmest in the face of frustration. There is a race for who can be kindest to children. There is a race measuring how gifted someone is at friendship. There are races focused on how attentive someone is to the evening sky or how good they are at deriving pleasure from autumn fruits.\n\nDespite our enthusiasm for sorting competitors into neat ranks, a striking fact about the multi-race event of life is, quite simply, that no one is ever able to be the winner in every competition available. Furthermore, prowess in one kind of race can militate against one\u2019s chances of success in others. Winning at being ruthlessly successful in business seems not \u2013 for example \u2013 generally to go hand in hand with ability in the race to appreciate the sky or find pleasure in figs. Equally, those who are terrific at gaining fame may be hampered when it comes to the race that measures ability to be patient around thoughtful but under-confident 3-year-olds.\n\nWe cannot, it seems, be winners at everything. Those who appear to be carrying off all the prizes and who are lauded as the superhuman athletes of life cannot, on closer examination, really be triumphing across the board. They are bound to be making a deep mess of some of the less familiar or prestigious races they are entered in for; in certain corners of the stadium, they\u2019ll be falling over, tripping up, complaining loudly about track conditions and, perhaps, sourly denigrating the whole event as useless and not worth participating in.\n\nIf one cannot be a winner at everything, it follows that one cannot be a loser at everything either. When we have failed in certain races in the milliathlon of life, we retain ample opportunities to train and develop our strength to win in others. We may never again be able to compete in the race for fame, honour or money, but it\u2019s still entirely open to us to compete in the race for kindness, friendship and forgiveness. We may even win in the not insignificant races for enjoying one\u2019s own company or sleeping very soundly and without anxiety for many hours.\n\nThere is no such thing as a winner or a loser, per se. There is only a person who has won in some areas and messed up in others. And, to go deeper, someone whose talent at winning in one sort of race means they must naturally and almost inevitably mess up in alternatives \u2013 and vice versa.\n\nWe never fail at life itself. When we mess up in worldly areas and feel dejected and isolated, the universe is just giving us an exceptional chance to begin the training that will one day mean we become star athletes in other less well-known but hugely important races \u2013 races about keeping a sense of humour, showing gratitude, forgiving, appreciating, letting go and making do. These are the noble tracks on which those who have \u2018failed\u2019 can finally, properly and redemptively learn to \u2018win\u2019.",

      "content": "## Time\n\nWhen it\u2019s just happened, our failure hurts so much because the memory of what we have lost is so vivid. We remember what it was like the previous summer \u2013 when we could still look forward to a prosperous future, when we were still being invited out, when we had some money and could sleep. During this time, we are continually tortured by the difference between what is and what might have been. If only we had been more careful with the document, if only we had listened to reason, if only we hadn\u2019t been so greedy, thoughtless, arrogant, lustful or vain \u2026\n\nBut the more the situation settles, the more we start to appreciate \u2013 with mature darkness \u2013 that there were some rather weighty reasons why things unfolded as they did. We were greedy, thoughtless, arrogant, lustful or vain not by random chance, but for reasons that run deep in our characters. We may not like the flowers that emerged, but the roots of these plants run many metres down and would almost certainly have manifested themselves somewhere, at some point, perhaps in even less propitious ways.\n\nWhat seems to have happened by \u2013 we initially think \u2013 a totally avoidable piece of ill luck emerges over time as a phenomenon with a firm, albeit grim, logic. Failure wasn\u2019t merely a coincidence or happenstance. The constituents of failure are as much part of us as the imprints of our fingers. We can\u2019t lean across to an adjoining table and wish we could have this bit of a more accomplished friend\u2019s life or that portion of a stranger\u2019s good fortune. We have to pay allegiance to who we actually are \u2013 in all zones of life, of which failure is in the end just one.\n\nWe will also, fortunately, start to forget. The alternative narrative in which we did not fail will grow ever more distant. We won\u2019t remember the way that the next year was supposed to go. We will forget what it was like to go to parties. We won\u2019t recognise the names of our enemies. As the months and years pass, what should not have happened will turn into what had to happen.\n\nWe will have had to fail \u2013 and then we will have learnt \u2013 in other areas, remarkably, in ways we had never expected and that still feel alien and impossible now \u2013 how to win.",

Most of the failure that ails us hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 and may never. It is apprehended failure: a failure of what might occur; a feverish deduction from our worst forebodings. We have spent valuable time torturing ourselves with scenarios that didn\u2019t come to pass. We have ruined some of the best days of our lives ruminating on catastrophes that in the end left us untouched. We have worried about the end of relationships that continued, we have panicked about money that didn\u2019t run out, we have feared reputational ruin that didn\u2019t visit us. We have wasted days by the sea on beautiful islands or in exciting foreign cities because in our minds, we were not able to be present at all, because we were rigid with terror, fearing the call of a journalist, a pained apology from a lover, an email from our boss, the collapse of our minds \u2026 We may have spent our lives outwardly free, while crouching in a cage of apprehension of our own making.\n\nThe fear of failure is every bit as serious and painful as failure itself. Just because an incident doesn\u2019t happen in the three-dimensional world doesn\u2019t mean that we can skirt its ravages. A calamity that is endlessly anticipated is in its way every bit as awful as a calamity that actually unfolds \u2013 with the added problem that fears tend to go on far longer than \u2018real\u2019 incidents. We might spend three decades ruminating on a fear of something that, if it really occurred, might only spoil a few years. Worries can be yet more destructive than the events they apprehend.\n\nThere are two ways of interpreting our fears of failure: that they are entirely made up and a consequence of inner emotional turmoil, or that they have some connection to true dangers but are wildly overblown and would be survivable even if they came to pass. Both cases deserve compassion and curiosity \u2013 as well as thorough responses and coping strategies.\n\nWhat follows is a consideration of the subject, which takes anticipated failure every bit as seriously as its real-world cousin \u2013 and which proposes that, just like it, it can eventually be endured and borne \u2026 and even leave us alone every now and then to enjoy the view and a little more of our brief and precious lives.",

      "content": "## Fear and Soothing\n\nThe inner life of a properly fearful person is so tormented that an ordinary day is able to serve up more occasions for terror and trepidation than would, for most of us, a rafting trip down one of the world\u2019s angriest rapids. On the outside, the fearful person may be doing nothing more remarkable than looking after a home or going to an office, but this tells us nothing about the scale of the challenges that they will be facing internally.\n\nFrom the moment they wake up, they will be haunted by a succession of the cruelest \u2018what ifs\u2019. What if an email has arrived overnight detailing news of an illness or scandal? What if the newspaper carries a story about an event that might destroy their livelihood? What if their partner\u2019s unusually severe or distracted manner is the first sign of a problem that ends in separation? What if the slight pain behind the eyes is the beginning of mental degeneration? What if they forgot to do something at work, which results in ruin? The questions never stop and nor does the worried person\u2019s inability to find any satisfying and calming answers to them. Their worries flap and bang in the winds of the mind all day and night like a badly fastened shutter in a winter storm.\n\nThe fearful person doesn\u2019t have a more frightening life than anyone else; they just lack the resources to extinguish the embers of worry that befall all of us in the course of an average day. At every turn, they end up with a major conflagration on their hands. The party they have to go to, the meeting they are attending, the letter they have to open, the social media feed they scroll through \u2013 each of these delivers yet another electric bolt of horror into their system.\n\nHow did life get to be so frightening for them? To understand this, we should travel far back in time and imagine a baby in the middle of the night. The room is dark, and the baby is hungry and wet right through. There is a terrible pain in their stomach and a tingly cold feeling all around their waist and their legs. Unable to work out what is wrong and without any means of altering it, the baby starts to scream, then ever louder, with all the desperation and strength in their young lungs; fast, panicky screams, begging for deliverance and assistance from multiple sources of pain that will not let up. Finally, after what felt like an age, but could in reality have been only a minute or two, a light comes on and, like a piece of supernatural intervention, the friendliest face in the world appears, illuminated from behind, with a gentle smile and encouraging eyes, and says: \u2018Now, now, what seems to be the matter? It looks like poppet might want a feed and maybe a new nappy \u2026\u2019 The words don\u2019t make any sense, but what happens next certainly does: the baby is lifted out of their cot, carefully changed, warmed and then settled at the breast, where they feed on the most satisfying and delicious meal that culinary art has ever produced, listening \u2013 in the background, alongside its own sucking noises \u2013 to the soft rhythm of a heart whose reassuring beats it remembers so well from the womb.\n\nFrom such experiences, repeated over many months, the baby learns to develop a vital trust in life. There may be pain and there might be fear, but these aren\u2019t eternal punishments. There are solutions to even the greatest terrors. A larger person can come along and make sense of the distress. The world doesn\u2019t have to be filled with unending torment.\n\nLater, if the young person\u2019s luck holds, similar forms of alleviation will continue \u2013 when, for example, Teddy loses its leg, when a bottle falls off the table and shatters across the kitchen floor, when another child comes and steals a toy, when Granny is ill, when their bike crashes into a tree, when it\u2019s the first day at school \u2026 At all such moments, a kindly adult is on hand to reassure, to contextualise, to explain, to offer sympathy, to look forward to better times and to plot alternative ways forward.\n\nThrough such manoeuvres, the child picks up the skill of soothing. Later on, when they have graduated, when they\u2019re out in the world, when they have love affairs and dependents and responsibilities at work, the lessons of the early days will still reverberate and offer a toolkit with which upsets and reversals can be faced. There may be some genuinely thorny problems, but they don\u2019t have to be a catastrophe; this won\u2019t be the end. The robust person understands that there are a great many steps between a danger sign and collapse. With one side of them acting as parent to the other, they can tell themselves, \u2018We may have loved them very much, but we will find others and have many good friends to see in the meanwhile,\u2019 or \u2018The criticism was very unfair and a little damaging, but we don\u2019t need everyone to like us and have just enough support to continue as we are.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, however, there are many less privileged people who have been gifted no such pacifying resources in their early lives. Perhaps when they screamed in the early hours, no adult came \u2013 or the one who did was as panicked as they were or seemed to be furious to be woken up at such an hour. Maybe the adult who came made the baby feel wicked for being so angry or was frightened by the intensity of the little one\u2019s needs. Later on, it\u2019s likely there was no easy recovery from a broken toy or a smashed bottle. Every graze generated an insuperable drama; every problematic moment at school was a cause of lasting commotion. From such experiences, there came a grave shortfall in the capacity for self-soothing. The muscle of the mind that might otherwise have argued the case for calm, forgiveness, perspective and compassion lacked any training. And therefore, there could only ever be a few short steps between a small reversal and a significant crisis: there could be no such thing as an insignificant or manageable problem. There could only ever be panic and cataclysm.\n\nIt may help us to understand our own fragilities to describe them as stemming from an inability to self-soothe. We are not wicked or dumb; we simply never learnt how to calm ourselves down because, long ago, no one else knew how to calm us down. We acquired lessons not in minimising the impact of reversals but in aggrandising minor misfortunes. We unwittingly became world experts in alarm.\n\nWith this sad knowledge painfully absorbed and mourned, we may be in a better position to learn \u2013 many decades later than we should \u2013 how to begin to utter a few calming affirmations in our minds. We can start to hunt out with greater vigour the sort of voices that should have been absorbed by our 3-month-old selves: the tranquillising tones of certain friends and authors, psychotherapists or lovers. The adult side of us can learn to play parent to a younger and more defenceless inner one. We can, metaphorically, stroke our own hair, wipe away our own tears \u2013 and feel sad that this form of nurture never came our way spontaneously in the early, jittery days.\n\nIn the process we will learn that we don\u2019t live in an exceptionally dangerous world; we simply happen to have endured an exceptionally unsoothing past.",

      "content": "## Fear and Self-hatred\n\nIn trying to discover the origins of fear, we may need to look in a slightly unobvious place: not in the purported content of our concerns, but instead (a topic we may be very reluctant to consider) in how we feel about ourselves. It may be that certain kinds of worries are, in the end, driven not so much by anything especially alarming in the world as by a compulsive need to find ourselves awful. Our fears may be a leading symptom of self-hatred.\n\nImagine someone at an airport heading out for a much-deserved and long-anticipated holiday. As they make their way through the check-in process, they start to become increasingly fearful that in their absence, they will be undermined by colleagues and eventually sacked. The thought doesn\u2019t leave them alone and by the time they reach their destination, they are certain that their career is over. Or, imagine someone in the early stages of a hugely satisfying love affair. Their new partner is kind, thoughtful and very funny. But one evening, when this partner is out with friends, the fearful person becomes sure that they are being cheated on; the partner must have met someone else and love is about to fail for them once again.\n\nIf we drill into our core, it becomes apparent that many worries are essentially efficient ways of beating ourselves up and of doubting whether we are good enough to deserve anything satisfying and desirable. By worrying, we are finding a highly efficient way of depriving ourselves of the right to be content. Somewhere inside our worried mind is a sense of being an unworthy person. Our fears are plugged into boundless subterranean stores of self-hatred.\n\nIf our starting position is one of self-hatred, then we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if we are never able to have a relaxing holiday or a mutually joyful love affair. Sadly, however, our minds don\u2019t come clean about their workings; they don\u2019t draw our attention to their perverse logic. Fears like to insist that they only concern themselves: the bungled email, the rumour, the missed call \u2026 But to be so certain that things are about to go wrong for us, at some point in our personal evolution we must have been given a sense that we were unworthy and shameful. We insist that bad things will happen to us because surely bad things must happen to bad people.\n\nThis analysis implies that we should stop taking our worries at face value; rather than ruminating without end on each example, we should shift towards a different and more salient topic \u2013 we should replace our anxious questions with a single, bolder sideways enquiry: \u2018Why can\u2019t I be kinder to myself?\u2019 The most effective way to calm down might be to try to address our feelings of unworthiness rather than seek reassurance for our panic.\n\nWe don\u2019t so much have fears to face \u2013 we have a deficit of self-love to make up. If we can find a way to feel more loveable, we might discover that the world also feels less fearsome.",

      "content": "## Trauma and Fearfulness\n\nThe core reason why many of us are more fearful than we should be is that we are \u2013 unbeknownst to ourselves \u2013 wandering through our lives with a huge burden of unresolved and unobserved trauma.\n\nA trauma is not merely a terrible event (though it is very much that too); it is a terrible event that has not been adequately processed, understood and unpicked and that has \u2013 through neglect \u2013 been able to cast a long and undeserved shadow over huge areas of experience. Many of our greatest fears have nothing at all to do with actual dangers in the here and now; they are the legacy of traumas that we have lacked the wherewithal to be able to trace back to their origins, to localise and to neutralise.\n\nThe concept of trauma was first observed in military contexts. Let us imagine a young man, in bed one night in a country torn apart by civil war. He hears a car alarm, followed, a few seconds later, by a huge explosion. The neighbourhood is destroyed and several members of his family are killed. He is devastated, but under pressure to continue with his life, is unable to reflect adequately or properly to mourn what has happened; he is forced to move on from a dreadful experience with fateful haste and lack of emotional assimilation. And yet the unattended memory of bloodshed, chaos and loss doesn\u2019t disappear. Instead, it curdles into an unknown interior presence we call trauma \u2013 which means that in the years and decades ahead, even in the most peaceful circumstances, whenever he hears a car alarm or indeed any high-pitched sound (that of an elevator\u2019s ping, for example) he will be mysteriously thrown back into the original panic, as if 1,000 tons of TNT were about to explode once again.\n\nHowever appalling this can be, psychologists have learnt that trauma can as easily be acquired in ostensibly peaceful circumstances. We don\u2019t need to have been through a war to be traumatised in multiple ways.\n\nImagine a 6-year-old child who makes an error in a maths exam and takes the news home; suddenly, her father \u2013 who drinks too much and might be battling depression and paranoia \u2013 flies into a rage, shouts at her, smashes a glass and slams the kitchen door. From the perspective of a 6-year-old, it feels like the world is ending. There is no way to make sense of the moment \u2013 beyond taking responsibility for it, and as a result feeling like a terrible human being. From this, a trauma develops, this one centred around making mistakes. It seems to the young girl that every slip threatens to unleash an explosion in others. Far into adulthood, every time there is a risk of an error, a terror arises in her that someone else will become dementedly furious. Everyone becomes terrifying because the one person in particular who was so scary hasn\u2019t been thought about and reckoned with in memory.\n\nAlternatively, we might imagine a little boy who is looked after by a very loving but very fragile single mother, who is prudish and scared of masculinity. The boy feels her disapproval and grows acutely guilty about his own more boisterous, vital dimensions. From this, he eventually develops a trauma around his sexual feelings; a part of him believes that to be sexual is to upset women \u2013 and therefore, even when he is with women who are keen on intimacy with him, he finds himself unable to feel excited or potent and always, for reasons he doesn\u2019t understand, moves to end the relationship. Every woman is imagined as disgusted with sex because one important woman in his formative years was thought to have been.\n\nIn all such cases, the solution is to get a better sense of the specific incidents in the past that have generated difficulties in order to unhook the mind from its expectations. The clue that we are dealing with a trauma \u2013 rather than any sort of justified fear \u2013 lies in the scale and intensity of feelings that descend in conditions when there is no objective rationale for them: it\u2019s peacetime, a man is kind, a woman is full of desire \u2026 and yet still there is terror, still there is self-disgust, still there is shame. We know then that we are dealing not with \u2018silliness\u2019 or \u2018madness\u2019 or indeed genuine danger, but with an unprocessed incident from the past casting a debilitating shadow on a more innocent present.\n\nAs traumatised people, the memory of the original incident is within us, but our conscious minds swerve away from the possibility of engaging with it and neutralising it through rational examination. Unable to mourn or decipher the event, much of life becomes mournful and not worth living. At the same time, the trauma breeds symptoms and neuroses that we cannot trace back to their founding moment \u2013 we forget why we are so scared, we just know that there are risks everywhere. A trauma is an agony that the conscious mind has lacked the support and resources to process \u2013 at the cost of our ability to love, to be free and to think creatively.\n\nYet if we can finally feel comfortable and safe enough to dare to look back, we\u2019ll be able to see the traumatising moment for what it was, outside of our original panic and our youthful or illogical conclusions (that it was our fault, that we did something wrong, that we are sinful). Liberating ourselves will mean understanding the specific, local and relatively unique features of what has traumatised us, and then growing aware of how our minds have multiplied and universalised the difficulty, in part to protect us from an encounter that was once too difficult to grapple with.\n\nWe will realise that it was one bomb that exploded and destroyed the neighbourhood \u2013 and that however dreadful this might have been, there is no reason for all high-pitched noises to terrify us. Similarly, it was one father who screamed at us for making a mistake when we were tiny \u2013 and not everyone who is in authority threatens to annihilate us in adulthood. Or it was one particular woman who made us feel that our sexuality was unacceptable, and so we should not assume that all women are revolted by us.\n\nSituations will continue to be frightening so long as individual incidents have not been understood and thought through with kindness and imagination. By properly gripping an establishing event in the claws of our rational adult mind and stripping it of its mystery, we will be able to repatriate fearful emotions \u2013 and render the world less unnerving than it presently seems. Life as a whole doesn\u2019t have to be so terrifying, once we understand the bits of it that truly were.",

      "content": "## Fear and Money\n\nIn many circles, those who work far more than they strictly need to and who strive with exceptional energy to accumulate as much money as possible are likely to be sneered at and lightly mocked. They may be dismissed as \u2018workaholics\u2019 and categorised as \u2018greedy\u2019.\n\nHowever, the story gets more complicated if we allow ourselves to enter imaginatively into their experiences (and perhaps compare them to our own). We may return to the office earlier than we need to, and be at our desk every weekend, because idleness makes us intensely uncomfortable. A feeling of eeriness and dread tends to descend on holidays, yet when we are racing against a self-imposed deadline, when every hour is timetabled for the next six months, we feel exhausted but also harnessed and directed. We have a plan that appears to guide and protect us. Similarly, we know we may not need all the money we are saving up and we understand there is no urgent necessity to go on yet another exhausting business trip, but with every large invoice we send out, we anticipate a feeling of calm and well-being.\n\nIn other words, beneath the apparent \u2018workaholism\u2019 and \u2018greed\u2019, something more interesting and vulnerable is stirring: we are on a search for safety. We tire ourselves building up financial reserves because this promises to deliver us a sense of assurance that we long for with an intensity we may not quite understand. We\u2019re not rapacious at all; we just feel in danger. Those who are particularly materially acquisitive are not vainer than the rest of us; they are simply far more frightened.\n\nAt a primal, unconscious level, money promises to be the conclusive answer to panic. With sufficient wealth, we sincerely believe that we can be at peace. We won\u2019t have to be unnerved by people ever again, we won\u2019t need to be surprised and terrified.\n\nUnfortunately, there is just enough truth in the longing to keep it alive for a lifetime. Money can \u2013 of course \u2013 on occasion spare us humiliation and difficulty. But its power is ultimately limited and always surpassed by our inner terror. The entrenched fear we wrestle with has a stubborn habit of enduring long after our most hopeful financial targets have been met. We might accumulate 100 or 500 million pounds and still \u2013 agonisingly \u2013 not be at peace. We may retire to a villa surrounded by a high wall patrolled by a private security firm and be sitting by an Olympic-sized pool sipping on an elderflower cordial, served to us by a kind and deferential servant, and still not feel safe. Four decades of constant labour may find us in a mansion in which we remain wracked by anxiety.\n\nThis paradox can only be explained by drilling into the roots of our original fear. As with most of our fears, an exorbitant longing for wealth is almost always generated by an experience of unmanageable let-down and humiliation in early life. People don\u2019t acquire a craving for superabundant riches until \u2013 and unless \u2013 they suffer a catastrophe in their formative years that they are unable to process and make sense of. Wealth becomes one of the primary compensatory fantasies in cases of unmanageable emotional loss; with wealth there promises to be an end to the aching and the self-doubt, the anxiety and the despair. With wealth, there will never again be a misfortune that cannot be mastered.\n\nInstead of blindly pursuing wealth, we should strive to remember, and to overcome, the original trauma that we suffered at the hands of others. We must keep in mind that we work harder than most because we were let down more than most \u2013 in a way that we have avoided focusing on all our adult lives. We need to find the sympathetic environment in which we can travel back in time to revisit our primal sorrow: the father who abandoned us, the mother who was too busy to care for us, the grandmother who mocked us. None of our financial skills will serve any useful purpose in terms of reducing panic until we can reconnect with the frightened little child we once were \u2013 and bring them the understanding and emotional reassurance they lacked. That will make us feel safe in a way no mansion ever can.\n\nThere is another, parallel solution to our woes that should also be pursued. We acquired a sense of being in danger \u2013 and grew financially desperate \u2013 because of a failure in our relations with a few significant others. Logically, therefore, the way to recover a feeling of safety will be via our relationships, though these will be of a very different kind. Whereas the experiences and emotions that damaged us were disappointment, abandonment and emotional coldness, so what will make us feel well and safe again will be reliability, closeness, tenderness and loyalty. We must repair the damage to our psyches with the very same tool that was used to scar us.\n\nMansions and expensive toys have their pleasures. But what they should never be mistaken for are routes to safety and emotional ease. We should not be surprised if we remain stressed and anxious despite our wealth. Instead, we must look back to our early betrayals and find proper emotional compensation through true treasure: people who are able to love us properly.",

      "content": "## Fear and Fame\n\nHowever attractive the life of famous people may seem from afar, from close up, it is usually a very different story. Something like the following scenario is, at some stage in their career, uncommonly likely to unfold.\n\nFrom the outside, all will appear to be going well. The reviews are ecstatic. The money is flowing in. The hotels are sumptuous and the private jets impeccable. The fans are eager and the dinner invitations from celebrity friends are constant. And yet, inside the mind of the famous person, there is turmoil on a scale unsuspected by almost everyone in the entourage. It started with a little niggle, but now it is a full-blown state of anxiety that begins at dawn and doesn\u2019t let up until the early hours. The famous person, beneath the smiles and the polished routines, will be contemplating the ruin of everything that they have worked for since the start. They will be imagining what might happen if a rival gets an advantage, if they make a mistake, if the critics turn against them. They will be haunted by spectres of disgrace and apprehensions of scandal. They will picture themselves having to give up the jet and take a bus. They will imagine their savings eroded and their name becoming a byword for shame.\n\nUnable to take the panic, they might take to drink, grow intensely irritable and develop a dependence on drugs. It might seem somehow unusual and unwarranted; it is \u2013 in reality \u2013 entirely predictable.\n\nIt is extremely rare to want to be very famous without an accompanying fear of invisibility and neglect. Fame is a salve invented by the traumatised to compensate for an early experience of unbearable let-down. No one who hadn\u2019t suffered from a sense of worthlessness \u2013 one that has not been understood or worked through \u2013 would actively wish to be known by so many complete strangers.\n\nToo often, the late-night panic of the famous results in a vow to become yet more successful and yet more well known. That, they feel, will surely quieten the fears at last. But peace of mind can never be won in this way. Ironically, however, being ever more famous just leads to more enemies, sniping, envy and the risk of scandal.\n\nThe only plausible route to safety is to become better acquainted with the original feeling of unacceptability that powered the aspiration to become exceptional \u2013 and to understand that maybe they never really wanted to be known to everyone, but rather they just wanted the love of a few very important people who (almost certainly) appeared to have better things to do or were too mentally unwell to be able to provide care.\n\nNo one ever really desires fame; they want \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 to feel loved. Fame for a time appears as though it may deliver on the original aspiration, but in reality, all it provides is paranoia and a continuous terror of downfall. The famous will truly have succeeded when they are able to walk away from being \u2018known\u2019 and towards the safety of being loved and seen by just one or two sets of eyes.",

      "content": "## Impostor Syndrome\n\nOne of the most frightening eventualities that may befall us \u2013 the trigger that more than any other has the power to catapult us into dread and self-doubt \u2013 is to succeed. To be promoted, praised, given a bigger salary, told that we are brilliant and awarded great responsibility. Success has an unparalleled capacity to generate terror, a longing to confess to one\u2019s true mediocrity and a desire to run away.\n\nAchieving little may well have its drawbacks: we feel belittled, overworked, mocked and disdained. But it spares us something far worse: having to disappoint others and be exposed as a fraud and a swindler. Inside the scared mind of the newly successful, a stream of tormenting thoughts is likely to roil: I don\u2019t deserve this, I will be found out, I am not good enough. In the hours ahead of a speech, all we may think of is how unworthy we are of our listeners; at a company meeting, a sense of inadequacy pursues us after every one of our utterances. We may be tempted to crash our lives deliberately, not because we relish losing what we have got, but because success has robbed us of all peace of mind.\n\nSuccess is commonly held up as a universal good, but it can only satisfy us in relation to our degree of self-love. Many of us long for success but do not know how to handle it. Nothing in our past may ever have led us to expect that we might one day be widely taken for decent, honourable, talented, intelligent or likeable people. Our childhoods may have left us with the firm impression that we must, at heart, be repugnant. Perhaps, long ago, our parents forcefully conveyed the idea that nothing we did could ever be acceptable, that we were ugly and disappointing, and another sibling was always the preferred option. From this, we will have developed into people with a deep conviction of our power to revolt anyone with a close understanding of our true natures.\n\nThis is what promises to unleash a crisis the moment that success comes our way. However momentarily pleasing a promotion or a new role may be, we have no option but to conclude that those who have approved of us must have done so on the basis of a mistake \u2013 which is bound, at some point, to be identified and then corrected. Though people in the vicinity may be complimenting us, though the applause appears sincere, the error is logically about to come to light. There has been a misunderstanding on a mass scale and soon enough, we\u2019ll be accused of faking our accomplishments and defrauding our benefactors \u2013 and will face the righteous anger owed to all liars. No wonder we can\u2019t sleep very easily. No wonder we can\u2019t stop picturing the day when we are at last unmasked. No wonder we scour social media and scan the eyes of all those we meet for the first signs of the searing revelations about to break.\n\nSo unbearable can this tension prove, we might try to assuage it by unconscious attempts to eradicate the discrepancy between the kindly verdict of the world and our private sense of low self-worth. We may start to sabotage ourselves before others get around to spotting our lies. Maybe we fluff our speech, insult our boss or leave our work undone. Before too long, to our secret relief, we will have succeeded in engineering our own downfall. We will have failed, but at least we will no longer have to be so scared of the future.\n\nOf course, there are better, kinder ways of resolving our impostor syndrome. For a start, by accepting what our childhoods never properly taught us: that we do not need to be flawless to deserve to succeed. We can be error-prone, worried and sometimes a little silly and still not be remotely fraudulent, for this is the way every human is constituted. There is no requirement to be impeccable in all areas in order to earn the right to exist, to be loved, to be accepted and to get a raise. We don\u2019t have to hold ourselves to a standard that no one could ever reasonably be expected to meet. We must instead allow that if the world \u2013 that busy, cynical, bruised and ungenerous place \u2013 really seems to think we are good enough, then we should give ourselves the benefit of the doubt as well. Our real task is to go back and try to persuade the one audience that continues to mock us without cause: our demented inner critic, fashioned and schooled by the unrepresentative figures and experiences of early childhood.",

      "content": "## The Benefits of a Breakdown\n\nSo dreadful can the idea of failing be in our eyes that we may spend much of our lives \u2013 and expend titanic energies \u2013 trying to avoid it. We work with ferocity, scheme relentlessly, ingratiate ourselves with people we loathe and fill every minute of the day with schemes to raise our income and highlight our name. We scan the horizon fearfully for enemies and risks. We are, in the end, engaged in an exhausting race, in which we only ever feel a few moments away from what scares us above all: the beast of failure.\n\nFor a long time, we may manage to stay just ahead of the spectre, until one day, wholly of our own accord, we come to an abrupt and surprising stop. We can\u2019t get out of bed; we can hardly speak; we can\u2019t be bothered to move or fight any more. We don\u2019t care what people are saying or what they will think. Despite everything we\u2019re meant to do and all the places we\u2019re expected to be, our deep selves are refusing to cooperate with our societal obligations. After a lifetime, something inside us can\u2019t take it any more. We\u2019re having a breakdown.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s the very worst thing that could happen. We\u2019re about to lose all our hard-won advantages. Our boss is shocked. Friends and family may try to remain sympathetic, but the disappointment on their faces is evident; this is extremely inconvenient for everyone who depends on us. Surely we were meant to be above this sort of thing? There are panicked attempts to contact doctors and psychiatrists and hopes that some pills might quickly bring this unfortunate episode to a close. Everyone longs for normality and a return to the treadmill of success. We are a truly terrifying sight, in our pyjamas at midday, wandering around the kitchen, talking about how meaningless most of what we have ever done has really been, gazing into the middle distance at a vase of lilac flowers and mumbling how we might want to change things, and be someone else.\n\nBreakdowns are undoubtedly frightening and a bore for those around us, but \u2013 within bounds \u2013 they can also be extremely useful. They can be occasions in which long pent-up or denied truths (about what we are angry about or deeply long for, what we want to do or who we hope to be with) punch through the veil of ordinary life and insist on being heard. A repressed authenticity fights the forces of inertia and the emotional status quo. We dare, in a way we perhaps have never done, to declare our true wishes. A breakdown may be a prelude to a breakthrough.\n\nFrom our earliest years, we might have felt that if we were to gain the support of people around us, we would have to succeed on their terms rather than our own. We sensed a choice between being loved and being real and \u2013 understandably enough \u2013 chose the former. We ticked boxes of their making. We jumped through their hoops. We became practiced at precisely meeting their expectations. We put our sincere selves away and bowed to their service. We developed world-beating expertise at people-pleasing.\n\nIn our careers, we likely chose a safe but honourable profession where we could be sure of applause. We led blameless, honourable lives; we toed the line, we laughed when we needed to. We did what was expected.\n\nBut the charade could only be expected to go on for so long. At some point, a deeper and more sincere part of us realises that we are going to die soon and declares that enough is enough. If this is the price of success, we want to fail. We may be scared of poverty and disapproval, but we are now even more scared of fakery. We cannot spend the whole of our lives in hock to the demands of people we secretly despise. We want to have lived at least a little before we have to die. And so we set about smashing the edifice of prestige and respectability that we have built up. We quit our job, we tell a few false friends to go away, we sit on our own for hours looking at the sky \u2013 and we weep at how insincere and lost we have been. We tell another few friends that we have at last found our path \u2013 and they ask us how long it might be until the medication starts to work. We have wilfully brought about failure in some areas of our lives in order to allow for a deeper, slower, quieter sort of success in another.\n\nFrom the prevalence of breakdowns, we can conclude that we don\u2019t simply fear failure; we also \u2013 in a strange way \u2013 long for it, because in certain incarnations, it can provide us with the energy to clear out the false gods we have been worshipping for too long. At this time, we make a resolution to stop pleasing everyone else in order to have a last, very overdue attempt at paying attention to the true self we have neglected for so long.",

      "content": "## Fear and Paranoia\n\nThere\u2019s a certain mood which, when it takes over us, can cause us to become increasingly scared of being on the receiving end of hostility from other people: it feels as if someone may imminently want to shout at us or say mean things about us. In this state of mind, when we leave a room, we imagine that everyone inside is hating on and mocking us. We picture gossip being exchanged about us online and off. We grow afraid of enemies who may want to seize our advantages and ruin things for us. We don\u2019t necessarily have a firm grip on where the danger lies or who exactly will damage us; we simply suspect that there is something looming. In response to this eerie sensation, we may proffer, in a joking tone, that we\u2019re feeling a bit \u2018paranoid\u2019 at the moment \u2013 but there is nothing to laugh at. We are being slowly crippled by worry.\n\nIn an effort to reduce our apprehensions at these times, we should begin in an unusual place: with the hunch that we have problems with anger. The truth is that we are probably the sort of individual who has a great deal of difficulty confronting people who frustrate or damage them. We are unlikely to be emotionally well equipped for showdowns. We dare not speak out when others stymie our plans or bully us subtly. We might stay in relationships far longer than we should \u2013 if leaving would mean upsetting someone by whom we are privately rather intimidated. At work, we may remain endlessly stuck in unsatisfactory positions, unable to build up the courage either to quit or to fight for a promotion.\n\nOur paranoid sensations are, arguably, the poisonous legacy of unexpressed anger. We acquire a general fear that other people will be hostile to us after having, at another time, failed to express ourselves with sufficient force and directness to a specific set of people who angered or harmed us. Paranoia is nothing more than repressed rage at other people, redirected against ourselves. It is as if a certain amount of anger is circulating in our system, seeking a way out, and when it can\u2019t find its intended target, it doesn\u2019t merely disappear, it builds up pressure and eventually ends up diverted towards the one subject who is handily close by and who won\u2019t complain: us.\n\nOur difficulties confronting people are liable to have begun in childhood with a parent who was unable to take the slightest expression of frustration or rage. They might have been so terrifying that we never dared to raise an objection to anything they said or wanted. Instead we nodded meekly in assent to every one of their suggestions \u2013 and watched in terror as they screamed or smashed up our bedroom. Or, perhaps our caregiver appeared so fragile to us that we did our best never to contradict them; maybe they complained that we would \u2018be the end of them\u2019 if we caused any sort of bother. We may have heard them declaring that they would kill themselves if things got too much.\n\nBut however much we might long to smile and please (both then and now), it will be impossible not to be angry and frustrated on regular occasions. Constant meekness is only ever a front; we all have wishes that go against those of others. We all need the opportunity to make a stand. The question is where the anger goes when it can\u2019t be shown. In childhood, a rage that we can\u2019t vent in front of our parents might come back at us in the form of an intense fear that we are about to be attacked by wild animals: we have to check under the bed numerous times just to make sure that there is no pack of hyenas or pride of lions hiding there. Later on, in adulthood, the fear may emerge as a form of political paranoia, wherein anger intended for a parent takes the form of a conviction in the mendacity and nastiness of an ideology or leader. Alternatively, rage at a spouse in a cold marriage might give rise to virulent misogyny or misandry. In diverse ways, anger that is intended for someone else always comes back to damage us.\n\nWith this mechanism in mind, if we find ourselves growing ever more fearful of particular people or dynamics, rather than continuing to ruminate (or seeking to reassure ourselves about lions or politicians), we would do well to change the subject completely and ask ourselves a possibly surprising-sounding question: \u2018Is there anyone relatively close to home, now or in the past, with whom we are unconsciously very, very angry?\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s probable that rather than a right- or left-wing conspiracy to \u2018get us\u2019, there is a parent whom we are very disappointed by. Or instead of a feminist or masculinist movement that wants to do us ill, there is a spouse we can\u2019t stand for a moment longer. Taking apart our paranoia will make the world at large feel much safer than it did, but it will also place the onus on us to do something we have resisted for too long: realise that we have the right to complain, that other people won\u2019t be able to harm us if we do and that we should dare to speak \u2013 with courage and politeness \u2013 lest meekness ends up destroying us.",

      "content": "## On Not Thinking Straight\n\nIt would be reassuring to believe that our degree of intelligence is relatively impervious to our emotional state; that, broadly speaking, we remain as clever as we ever are whatever happens to be unfolding for us emotionally. Of course, in certain very dramatic moments, it\u2019s expected that our cleverness might take a hit: it would be hard to do quadratic equations accurately if there was a tiger in the room. But on the whole, surely one or two waves of emotional disturbance shouldn\u2019t knock out a faculty as central and as long-established as intelligence \u2026\n\nThis, however, is to underestimate the extent to which \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 our powers of reason are apt to fail us entirely under particular conditions. By all objective measures we may display every sign of high intelligence: we may have an excellent grasp of history and politics, science and art. We may be capable of running a sizeable team or managing a high-profile career. And yet, faced with certain challenges, we are wont to relapse into the reasoning patterns of the very young and very unqualified child we once were.\n\nIt appears by the way our minds are built, that no age that we have ever travelled through is ever entirely superseded and rendered inaccessible to us. Like a Russian doll, beneath an adult shell we contain all our past selves, to which we will be sent back according to outer circumstances. A person who was bullied by an overbearing parent as a 5-year-old may, since then, have acquired two PhDs, gained membership in an elite intellectual circle and have raised a family. And yet when this unfortunate soul comes up against a bullying older adversary, they may have no capacity whatsoever to approach them as an adult with a right to live \u2013 let alone a deep understanding of Roman law, the novels of George Eliot and the workings of semiconductors. Instead, they meet this parental figure once again as a shy and defenceless child, worried that they are going to be hit or annihilated, and as a result, they struggle to form coherent sentences or remember their own name. We are apt to return to precisely the degree of intelligence that we possessed when certain difficulties arose in childhood and seared themselves across our neuronal pathways. Trauma keeps us as cognitively limited as we were when a given disaster struck us.\n\nThe way in which our intelligence is hampered by our emotions means that we misread reality without noticing our blindness. For example, we might be unable to recognise that someone is treating us unfairly in an intimate relationship and that we would have every right to make a complaint, because we grew up to expect this kind of treatment and to not question it. Our sizeable intelligence walks right past an issue that would immediately attract the attention of any moderately interested outsider.\n\nOr we may be unable to consider the extent of our freedom and our options to leave a job or start a new life, because our intelligence has been silenced by an emotional expectation that suffering and resignation are our dues. We may also find it impossible to see that we are falling into depression because a chance to be angry was never granted to us, or that we are developing a paranoia as an alternative to directing anger back at an adversary, or that we are impelled to crash our career because of an impression of unworthiness.\n\nFear isn\u2019t only unpleasant \u2013 it makes us \u2018stupid\u2019. Yet, devilishly, it does so in ways that we can\u2019t easily observe. Our reasoning faculties switch off, but without granting us even a hint that they are doing so. We don\u2019t sense our panic; we don\u2019t feel our intellectual wattage being dialled down to close to zero. We have no subjective awareness of when our adult brains are quietly unplugged and surreptitiously replaced by those of na\u00efve and terrified infants.\n\nEven if we cannot grasp that we are not thinking straight \u2013 and perhaps because of that fact \u2013 we should allow for the overall possibility of the phenomenon and make the necessary adjustments. We should forgive our traumatised minds for not being able to yield an accurate picture of the world, its threats and its options, and treat them with good humour. We shouldn\u2019t feel insulted that, without warning, we will at times be as cognitively limited as a worried, shamed and na\u00efve 4-year-old. In turn, when we find ourselves in emotional zones that we identify as dangerous, we should take care to have a few other adequately sized brains around us into which, like a machine with a depleted battery, we can plug ourselves \u2013 so as to recalibrate our assessment of the choices in front of us.\n\nAt moments when we are convinced that failure is staring us in the face, when we are sure that bankruptcy, abandonment, exile or disgrace is about to strike, we should do ourselves the favour of imagining that we are, perhaps, not in any danger at all; rather we have stopped being able to think straight. We have done so not because we are inherently stupid (it would be easier if we were), but because while we are extremely intelligent, at this instant \u2013 due to an invisible and regrettable connection between our present-day challenge and one in the past that we had to face without adequate love or care \u2013 we have regressed to an earlier state of cognitive ability and most of our brain is not available for use.\n\nRather than continuing to take our fears as facts, we should good-naturedly accept that our minds are simply prone to faulty readings; that there almost certainly is no tiger in the room, no monster about to swallow us and no catastrophe about to destroy everything. There is simply an adult mind that, for very good and very sad reasons, has completely stopped working for a while \u2013 and needs some help.",

We may feel that we\u2019re not the sort to weep over our fate or feel that we have been given a particularly bad set of cards. And yet, the more we revisit the past and consequently get a handle on the causes of our fears, the more we may allow ourselves one or two moments of compassion for the experiences we\u2019ve been exposed to and their repercussions down the decades. We have grown into fear-laden people because, when we were far too young to interpret and manage what was happening, we were let down. Someone shouted at us inordinately and didn\u2019t allow us to get annoyed back. Someone told us that we would only ever be acceptable if we achieved extraordinary things. Someone gave us the impression that we didn\u2019t deserve to succeed. Someone didn\u2019t come to soothe us when we were screaming in the night and was unable to equip us with the tools to dampen our panic and sorrows in adult life. These people may not have intended to cause harm, but we have been severely wounded nevertheless.\n\nIn the broadest sense, we are afraid of failure because we were not properly loved. We were not held, reassured, calmed down, delighted in and accepted unconditionally. We believe that the world is filled with risks, not because we face unprecedented obstacles, but because we have unusually difficult histories. The catastrophe we apprehend has in fact already happened, but until now we have found it too hard to think about it. We were too busy working, trying to impress or fending off imagined enemies.\n\nBut now, in a quiet corner of our minds, we can finally take the chance to behave like a loving parent towards our frightened and frantic inner self. We can sit ourselves on our own knee, stroke our own forehead, hold our own hand and tell ourselves that we are \u2013 whatever we may think \u2013 a very interesting and kindly person whom it is a privilege to know and to look after. We can congratulate ourselves on how hard we have tried and what enormous efforts we have made. We can tell ourselves that perhaps now is a time for change \u2013 that there has been enough endless material and status striving, enough jockeying for position and hope for preferment, enough busyness and exhaustion, self-flagellation and masochism. Now, instead, there is a chance to reorient our lives towards greater relational warmth. We can whisper, away from the sarcastic and brutal alternative voices who still like to shout inside us, that the time for fear has come to an end \u2013 and that a reign of love and safety can begin.",

In order to construct the quieter, less pressured lives we long for \u2013 lives in which we might be able to minimise contact with the sorts of events, people and opinions that torment and sadden us \u2013 we need also to alter our habits.\n\nWhat might some of the elements of a less pressured existence look like?",

A parent\u2019s first thought, whenever there is a tantrum or hysteria, is whether it might be time to go upstairs, close the curtains and lie down for forty minutes. They will refuse to engage in a discussion about sweets or toys or trips, not because these aren\u2019t legitimate topics, but because they know that so long as the mind has not rested, no good conclusions can ever be reached.\n\nWise adults should consider themselves as identical to 9-month-olds in this sense. We should not be interested in marathons of endurance. Rather, as soon as we notice our panic rising and latching on viciously to an ever-expanding array of topics, we must recognise what is going to happen \u2013 and know better than to try to think our way out of fear with only an exhausted brain for assistance.

      "content": "## Thinking of the Worst\n\nWhen we are worried about failure and take our anxieties to our friends, the response that we are most likely to receive is that our fears are overblown and will almost certainly never come to pass. The error won\u2019t be uncovered, the slip-up wasn\u2019t noticed, the enemy isn\u2019t so nasty, people won\u2019t mind; it will be fine.\n\nAt first it sounds almost entirely reassuring. But something within the optimism being offered is likely to leave us with an uneasy feeling \u2013 one that we can\u2019t entirely shake off, and that has a habit of reappearing late at night or when we are in a jittery mood. We desperately want to believe that we are safe, but what if \u2013 after all, despite the reassurance \u2013 we are not? Are there not many cases in which, despite good odds, things nevertheless go very, very wrong? What if the error is uncovered, what if our mistake is treated harshly \u2013 what if the world ends up in an unforgiving frame of mind?\n\nThese questions can pursue us relentlessly, growing ever more impervious to our optimism. We may try to pile more reassurance onto the fire of worry, but no matter what we attempt, the anxiety continues to mount. It\u2019s at this point that we should try an initially alarming, but ultimately profoundly fruitful, move: thinking about, and making friends with, the very worst.\n\nRather than assuming that we will be saved, we should deliberately try to imagine every fear turning into reality: the shock of our clients, the surprise of our colleagues, the scandalised headlines in newspapers, the arrival of the police, the jeering of crowds, the packed courtroom, the bare prison cell, the lost decade in an institution, the desertion of lovers, the contempt of one\u2019s children, the ruin of every last hope.\n\nIt might sound like a recipe for cataclysmic panic, but far from it: careful, close-up, reasoned examination of the worst-case scenario is liable to throw up a surprising fact: that the worst is actually survivable. Desirable it certainly isn\u2019t, awful it would often be, but it would also \u2013 overall \u2013 turn out to be something that we could, just, get through.\n\nWe could \u2013 when we think about it \u2013 imagine losing all but two good friends and surviving. We could imagine spending a few years in prison or becoming a byword for infamy \u2013 and surviving. It absolutely wouldn\u2019t be what we would wish for, but, all things considered, it would be endurable.\n\nWhat our minds are especially and unduly tortured by is uncertainty. Often, what worries us most are outcomes that we cannot divine, issues over which we lack any firm control or definitive information: we can\u2019t foresee whether we\u2019ll get the right grades in an exam, we can\u2019t know whether a business will go bust, we have no total assurance \\ about whether our relationship will survive.\n\nIn such a situation, hungry for certainty, the racing, anxious mind throws us into constant turmoil. Wishing to be reassured completely, it keeps us awake with a litany of the same familiar questions: Will we be OK? Will the bad thing happen? Is it going to be fine?\n\nTo close off this tortuous cycle of never-ending questions, we should boldly stand up to our nagging selves and deliver a very definitive-sounding answer. We must assume that everything terrible will happen, and then concentrate all our energy on trying to figure out how the terrible might turn out to be bearable \u2013 which it will be, for certain.\n\nIt\u2019s an ineradicable part of being human that we simply cannot know what elements of suffering we will need to pass through before we are at last delivered to our final resting place. Every day sees us walk \u2013 usually blithely \u2013 past a thousand risks. We may continue to pass through unharmed \u2013 or else a blunder or two will wind us up in infamy, poverty and shame. Right now, in another part of town or a faraway continent, our sad end may be being worked out. Disaster might strike by nightfall. We don\u2019t need any formal belief in the gods to appreciate that our destinies are not in our own hands; that at any moment (whatever our levels of wealth, probity, youth or vigour) we might fall prey to the most appalling reversals \u2013 and so we would be wise to walk lightly and with reverence across the unpredictable, troubled face of the Earth.\n\nNevertheless, we can buttress our natural exposure to fate with a tenacious degree of defiant stoic pessimism. We don\u2019t have to greet the unknown in terror, on our knees, quivering. We may stand up tall, knowing that the most egregious events might visit us, but that we would \u2013 somehow \u2013 find a way through them. And, if we couldn\u2019t, if every single breath was agony, we might even darkly allow \u2013 despite a million careful caveats \u2013 that the pain wouldn\u2019t have to be endless. It\u2019s in the context of the reassuring power of the very darkest thoughts that we can approach failure.\n\nMany of us will never have to face real-world failure, but we will be haunted and tortured by the idea that we might have to \u2013 and in no position to be comforted by easy suggestions that things are sure to be fine. This is why we must consider at length the practical and psychological realities of extreme failure (the ideal sort of hut to build and how to handle the desertion of all our friends). Not because we will fail, but because the only way to dilute our fears is to examine the thought that we might in exhaustive detail \u2013 and thereby realise that it can be borne.\n\nThose afraid of failure and those who have failed have much to offer one another. The failed are living proof that failure can be endured \u2013 while the fearful are an ideal constituency on which the failed (especially if they are looking out for new employment that can grant them a gainful sense of service) can practise their wisdom and deliver solace.\n\nWe waste far too much time scaling or dreaming of the peaks of worldly success. Now is the moment to turn our attention to becoming those unlikely, but much more important, members of society: good failures. These are people who know how to be kind, empathetic, gentle, humorous, humble, grateful and imaginative in the face of disaster \u2013 and who are therefore always ready to lend a hand to fellow vulnerable, ailing humans who have been damned by fate and who, for now, struggle to remember any reasons to live. That will be redemption and success properly worthy of the word.",

The age is overwhelmingly alive to the benefits of active, social, complex and ambitious ways of living. Lauding a quiet life has some of the eccentricity of praising rain.\n\nWe are suspicious because the defenders of quiet lives have so often come from the most implausible sections of the community \u2013 slackers, hippies, the work-shy, the fired \u2013 those who seem like they never had a choice; people whose quiet lives appear to have been imposed upon them by their own ineptitude.\n\nYet, when we examine things further, busy lives turn out to have so many incidental costs that we have been collectively committed to ignoring. At the top, alongside our privileges, we may grow impoverished in curious ways. Our every word may be listened to with trembling respect within a vast organisation, but what we cannot do is admit that we are extremely tired and want to spend the afternoon reading on the sofa. We become strangers to those who love us outside of our wealth and status, while depending ever more on the fickle attention of those for whom we are our achievements alone. Our children see ever less of us. Our spouses grow bitter. We may own the wealth of continents, but it has been ten years at least since we last had the chance to do nothing for a day.\n\nAt this point in history, we are so fixated on the idea that poverty must always be involuntary and therefore the result of lack of talent and indigence, we have trouble imagining that it might be the result of an intelligent and skilled person\u2019s free choice based on a rational evaluation of costs and benefits. It might sincerely be possible for someone to decide not to take the better-paid job, not because they had no chance, but because, having surveyed the externalities involved, they did not think them worth it.\n\nWhen we come to know the true price some ways of life exact, we may realise we are not willing to pay for the envy, fear, deceit and anxiety. Our days on earth are limited. For the sake of true riches, we may willingly, and with no loss of dignity, opt to become a little more reclusive, temperate and obscure.",

We may be irritated that it is raining, but we are unlikely ever to respond to a shower by screaming. We aren\u2019t overwhelmed by anger whenever we are frustrated; we are sent into a rage only when we first allowed ourselves to believe in a hopeful scenario that was then dashed suddenly and apparently without warning. Our greatest furies spring from unfortunate events that we had not factored into our vision of reality.\n\nWe typically think of anger as a dark and pessimistic state of mind. But behind anger lies a surprising emotion: optimism. Beneath their ranting, the angry are possessed of some recklessly optimistic notions of how life might go. They are not merely in a destructive fury; they are in the grip of hope.\n\nThe person who shouts every time they encounter a traffic jam betrays a faith, at once touching and demented, that roads must always be traffic-free. The person who loses their temper with every new employee or partner evinces a curious belief that perfection is an option for the human animal.\n\nSerenity therefore begins with pessimism. We must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before the world ever has a chance to slap us by surprise at a time of its own choosing. The angry must learn to check their fury via a systematic, patient surrender of their more fervent hopes. They need to be carefully inducted into the darkest realities of life, to the stupidities of others, to the ineluctable failings of technology, to the necessary flaws of infrastructure. They should start each day with a short yet thorough premeditation on the many humiliations and insults to which the coming hours risk subjecting them.\n\nOne of the goals of civilisation is to instruct us in how to be sad rather than angry. Sadness may not sound very appealing, but in this context it carries a huge advantage. It allows us to detach our emotional energies from fruitless fury around things that (however bad) we cannot change and that are the fault of no-one in particular and \u2013 after a period of mourning \u2013 to refocus our efforts in places where our few remaining hopes and expectations have a realistic chance of success.",

She wants to play, even if it\u2019s past nine o\u2019clock now, with us in the chair and her sliding around the kitchen, and, unexpectedly, so do we. We\u2019re not offended by her lack of overall interest in us; it\u2019s at the root of our delight. Here, at last, is someone indifferent to almost everything about us except for our dexterity at ball-throwing; someone who doesn\u2019t care about the Brussels meeting, who will forgive us for not warning the finance department in time about the tax rebates and for whom the conference is beyond imagining.\n\nOne of the most consoling aspects of animals \u2013 whether a dog, sheep, lizard or beetle \u2013 is that their priorities have nothing to do with our own perilous and tortured agendas. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest, sense of our role on the planet.\n\nA sheep doesn\u2019t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never sent an email. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we\u2019re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool; for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused, glance.\n\nDucks nibble at the weeds, waddle down to the water and paddle about in circles without any interest in which century it happens to be from a human point of view; they\u2019ve never heard of the economy; they don\u2019t know what country they live in; they don\u2019t have new ideas or regret what happened yesterday. They don\u2019t care about the career hurdles or relationship status of the person who sprinkles a few breadcrumbs near them.\n\nTime around animals invites us into a world in which most of the things that obsess us have no significance.

A mind prey to this disease can never picture any solid steps between the present and the very worst scenarios \u2013 only and always a direct line. If an ex-partner is unhappy with them, the catastrophiser won\u2019t imagine that this is only one mood of theirs, that this former lover is broadly benign and understanding. Instead, the most dire conclusion is immediate: the ex will be furious and bent on unending torture. As on so many other occasions (with the disgruntled employee or the frustrated neighbour), the catastrophiser will irresistibly reach for the most awful and pitiless story. It will be impossible to sleep, they will lose their appetite, they won\u2019t have any energy to see friends, their whole future will be called into question. There is simply no such thing as a \u2018small\u2019 issue.\n\nThe catastrophiser may, across most of their lives, have attained minimal insight into their way of thinking, let alone compassion for it. It seems to be just the way things are. The unfortunate catastrophiser might be on the receiving end of a great many recommendations to \u2018stop worrying\u2019.\n\nWhat this neglects is that catastrophic thinking is a clinical condition \u2013 and that it tends to have a history. It is almost always a symptom of having encountered a real full-blown catastrophe somewhere before. It may not be an encounter with a catastrophic event so much as familiarity with catastrophic feelings \u2013 which are generally much easier to lose sight of or to be actively disguised by those who caused them for us.\n\nCatastrophisers have made a deduction about what will happen on the basis of what has \u2013 at some point \u2013 already happened. They might, as a toddler, have been on the receiving end of volcanic rage from a parent. The parent might not actually have excommunicated them, but that is certainly what it felt like \u2013 in that kitchen, when the crockery was smashed, and the screaming didn\u2019t let up for twenty minutes.\n\nThere is a lot of our history bound up in what we catastrophise about. A question to ask ourselves is: what bit of my past is the catastrophic scenario I fear telling me about? What does the awful thing I dread hint to me about the awful thing I have previously gone through?\n\nWe begin to get a handle on our catastrophic imaginations not by being told to be calm or learning about the theories of the ancient Stoics, but when we can develop the courage to explore what once went very wrong and then learn to distinguish then from now.\n\nWe begin to soothe ourselves by remembering that we are no longer the children we once were. We have allies, we can call professionals, we have access to law courts and hospitals. Something requires our concern; but \u2013 whatever our agitated minds so often like to tell us \u2013 it lies in the past, not the future.",

Couples fall out spectacularly over whether it is necessary to use a chopping board when cutting bread, how clean the bathroom needs to be or whether it matters if a drawer is left slightly open. What fuels the conflict is a sense that these are trivial matters, unworthy of careful discussion, on which there may be varied and dignified schools of thought.\n\nThe fiendish irony is that we behave with exactly this respect around other details that matter much less in our lives. Art historians will hold an international conference on the pose of a hand in a painting by Picasso; huge corporations will devote immense efforts to finding just the right words to announce the merits of a chocolate bar to the world.\n\nWe don\u2019t always despise details; we are guided by the larger cultural picture of whether a detail deserves attention.

      "content": "## Early Nights\n\nTo a surprising, and almost humiliating, extent, some of the gravest problems we face during a day can be traced back to a brutally simple fact: that we have not had enough sleep the night before.\n\nThe idea sounds profoundly offensive. There are surely greater issues than tiredness. We are likely to be up against genuine hurdles: the economic situation, politics, problems at work, tensions in our relationship, the family \u2026\n\nThese are true difficulties. But what we often fail to appreciate is the extent to which our ability to confront them with courage and resilience is dependent on a range of distinctly \u2018small\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 factors: what our blood sugar level is like, when we last had a proper hug from someone, how much water we\u2019ve drunk \u2013 and how many hours we\u2019ve rested.\n\nWe tend to resist such analyses of our troubles. It can feel like an insult to our rational, adult dignity to think that our sense of gloom might stem from exhaustion. We would sooner identify ourselves as up against an existential crisis than see ourselves as sleep deprived.\n\nWe should be careful of under- but also of over-intellectualising. To be happy, we require large, serious things (money, freedom, love), but we need a lot of semi-insultingly little things too (a good diet, hugs, rest).\n\nAnyone who has ever looked after babies knows this well. When life becomes too much for them, it is almost always because they are tired, thirsty or hungry. With this in mind, it should be no insult to insist that we never allow ourselves to adopt a truly tragic stance until we have first investigated whether we need to have some orange juice or lie down for a while.\n\nProbably as a hangover from childhood, \u2018staying up late\u2019 feels a little glamorous and even exciting; late at night is when (in theory) the most fascinating things happen. But in a wiser culture than our own, some of the most revered people in the land would, on a regular basis, be shown taking to bed early. There would be competitions highlighting sensible bedtimes. We would be reminded of the pleasures of already being in bed when the last of the evening light still lingers in the sky. Our problems would not thereby disappear, but our strength to confront them would at points critically increase.",

      "content": "## Good Materialism\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to suggest that there might be such a thing as \u2018good materialism\u2019: after all, surely materialism is just plain bad? When people want to pinpoint the root cause of corruption in our age, they generally only need to point the finger at our attachment to material things. We\u2019re apparently sick because we\u2019re so materialistic.\n\nIt can seem as if we\u2019re faced with a stark choice. Either you can be materialistic: obsessed with money and possessions, shallow and selfish. Or you can reject materialism, be good and focus on more important matters of the spirit.\n\nBut most of us are, in our hearts, stuck somewhere between these two choices, which is uncomfortable. We are still enmeshed in the desire to possess \u2013 but we are encouraged to feel rather bad about it.\n\nYet, crucially, it\u2019s not actually materialism \u2013 the pure fact of buying things and getting excited by possessions \u2013 that\u2019s ever really the problem. We\u2019re failing to make a clear distinction between good and bad versions of materialism.\n\nLet\u2019s try to understand good materialism through a slightly unusual route: religion. Because we see them as focused exclusively on spiritual things, it can be surprising to note how much use religions have made of material things. They have spent a lot of time making and thinking about temples, monasteries, artworks, clothes and ceremonies.\n\nHowever, they have cared about these things for one reason only \u2013 because they have wanted material things to serve the highest and noblest purpose: the development of our souls. It is just that they have recognised that we are incarnate sensory bodily beings \u2013 and that the way to get through to our souls has to be, at least in part, through our bodies (rather than merely through the intellect).\n\nIn the Catholic Mass, great significance is accorded to bread and wine, which are believed to be transubstantiations of Christ; that is, material objects which simultaneously have a spiritual identity, just as Jesus himself combined the spiritual and the bodily while on earth.\n\nThis can sound like a very weird and arcane point entirely removed from the local shopping mall \u2013 but the same concept actually applies outside of religion. Many good material possessions can be said to involve a kind of \u2018transubstantiation\u2019, whereby they are both practical and physical and also embody or allude to a positive personality or spirit.\n\nMaterial objects can therefore be said to play a positive psychological (or spiritual) role in our lives when higher, more positive ideals are \u2018materialised\u2019 in them, and so buying and using them daily gives us a chance to get closer to our better selves.\n\nThis is not to say that all consumerism just conveniently turns out to be great. It depends on what a given material object stands for. An object can transubstantiate the very worst sides of human nature \u2013 greed, callousness, the desire to triumph \u2013 as much as it can the best. So we must be careful not to decry or celebrate all material consumption: we have to ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by making, are those that lend most encouragement to our higher, better natures.",

      "content": "## Gratitude\n\nThe standard habit of the mind is to take careful note of what\u2019s not right in our lives and obsess about all that is missing.\n\nBut in a new mood, perhaps after a lot of longing and turmoil, we pause and notice some of what has \u2013 remarkably \u2013 not gone wrong. The house is looking beautiful at the moment. We\u2019re in pretty good health, all things considered. The afternoon sun is deeply reassuring. Sometimes the children are kind. Our partner is \u2013 at points \u2013 very generous. It\u2019s been quite mild lately. Yesterday, we were happy all evening. We\u2019re quite enjoying our work at the moment.\n\nGratitude is a mood that grows with age. It is extremely rare to properly delight in flowers or a quiet evening at home, a cup of tea or a walk in the woods when one is under 22. There are so many larger, grander things to be concerned about: romantic love, career fulfilment and political change.\n\nHowever, it is rare to be left entirely indifferent by smaller things in time. Gradually, almost all our earlier, larger aspirations take a hit, perhaps a very large hit. We encounter some of the intractable problems of intimate relationships. We suffer the gap between our professional hopes and the available realities. We have a chance to observe how slowly and fitfully the world ever alters in a positive direction. We are fully inducted to the extent of human wickedness and folly \u2013 and to our own eccentricity, selfishness and madness.\n\nAnd so, \u2018little things\u2019 start to seem somewhat different; no longer a petty distraction from a mighty destiny, no longer an insult to ambition, but a genuine pleasure amidst a litany of troubles, an invitation to bracket anxieties and keep self-criticism at bay, a small resting place for hope in a sea of disappointment. We appreciate the slice of toast, the friendly encounter, the long, hot bath, the spring morning \u2013 and properly keep in mind how much worse it could, and probably will one day, be.",

      "content": "## Home\n\nOne of the most meaningful activities we are ever engaged in is the creation of a home. Over a number of years, typically with a lot of thought and considerable dedication, we assemble furniture, crockery, pictures, rugs, cushions, vases, sideboards, taps, door handles and so on into a distinctive constellation that we anoint with the word \u2018home\u2019. As we create our rooms, we engage passionately with culture in a way we seldom do in the supposedly higher realms of museums or galleries. We reflect profoundly on the atmosphere of a picture; we ponder the relationship between colours on a wall; we notice how consequential the angle of the back of a sofa can be and ask carefully what books truly deserve our ongoing attention.\n\nOur homes will not necessarily be the most attractive or sumptuous environments we could spend time in. There are always hotels or public spaces that would be a good deal more impressive. But after we have been travelling a long while, after too many nights in hotel rooms or in the spare rooms of friends, we typically feel a powerful ache to return to our own furnishings \u2013 an ache that has little to do with material comfort per se. We need to get home to remember who we are.\n\nCreating a home is frequently such a demanding process because it requires us to find our way to objects that can correctly convey our identities. We may have to go to enormous efforts to track down what we deem to be the \u2018right\u2019 objects for particular functions, rejecting hundreds of alternatives that would, in a material sense, have been perfectly serviceable in the name of those we believe can faithfully communicate the right messages about who we are.\n\nWe get fussy because objects are, in their own ways, hugely eloquent. Two chairs that perform much the same physical role can articulate entirely different visions of life. An object feels \u2018right\u2019 when it speaks attractively about qualities that we are drawn to, but don\u2019t possess strong enough doses of in our day-to-day lives. The desirable object gives us a more secure hold on values that are present yet fragile in ourselves; it endorses and encourages important themes in us. The smallest things in our homes whisper to us; they offer us encouragement, reminders, consoling thoughts, warnings or correctives, as we make breakfast or do the accounts in the evening.\n\nThe quest to build a home is connected with a need to stabilise and organise our complex selves. It\u2019s not enough to know who we are in our own minds. We need something more tangible, material and sensuous to pin down the diverse and intermittent aspects of our identities. We need to rely on certain kinds of cutlery, bookshelves, laundry cupboards and armchairs to align us with who we are and who we seek to be. We are not vaunting ourselves; we\u2019re trying to gather our identities in one receptacle, preserving ourselves from erosion and dispersal. Home means the place where our soul feels that it has found its proper physical container, where, every day, the objects we live among quietly remind us of our most authentic commitments and loves.",

      "content": "## Kintsugi\n\nKin = golden\n\ntsugi = joinery\n\nThe origins of kintsugi are said to date to the Muromachi period, when the Shogun of Japan, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358\u20131408), broke his favourite tea bowl. Distraught, he sent it to be repaired in China. On its return, he was horrified by the ugly metal staples that had been used to join the broken pieces, and charged his craftsmen with devising a more appropriate solution. What they came up with was a method that didn\u2019t disguise the damage but made something honestly artful out of it.\n\nKintsugi belongs to the Zen ideals of wabi-sabi, which cherishes what is simple, unpretentious and aged \u2013 especially if it has a rustic or weathered quality. A story is told of one of the great proponents of wabi\u2013sabi, Sen no Riky\u016b (1522\u20131591). On a journey through southern Japan, he was invited to dinner by a host who thought he would be impressed by an elaborate and expensive antique tea jar that he had bought from China. But Riky\u016b didn\u2019t even seem to notice this item and instead spent his time chatting and admiring a branch swaying in the breeze outside. In despair at this lack of interest, once Riky\u016b had left, the devastated host smashed the jar to pieces and retired to his room. But the other guests more wisely gathered the fragments and stuck them together through kintsugi. When Riky\u016b next came to visit, the philosopher turned to the repaired jar and, with a knowing smile, exclaimed: \u2018Now it is magnificent\u2019.\n\nIn an age that worships youth, perfection and the new, the art of kintsugi retains a particular wisdom \u2013 as applicable to our own lives as to a broken teacup. The care and love expended on the shattered pots should lend us the confidence to respect what is damaged and scarred, vulnerable and imperfect \u2013 starting with ourselves and those around us.",

But in our urgent and never-guaranteed search to extend life, we ignore a more realistic and significant possibility: that of altering how intensely we live it.\n\nCrucially, not all time is equal. Time stretches and extends the more we take hold of events, dissect them and turn them over in our minds \u2013 just as it seems to shrink and run through us when we only squint at reality, perhaps because we are too scared of the future, sad about the past, obedient to an agenda set by people around us or ambitious about what\u2019s to come.\n\nEvery minute we are alive is equal from a purely physiological basis, but at the level of the psyche, we can speak of periods of being more or less aware of being here; we can \u2013 as it were \u2013 live more or less consciously.\n\nWithout trying, small children are masters of conscious living \u2013 which is why a walk with them to the park may take four times as long as we had anticipated. There are, after all, so many leaves to examine, so many flat large pebbles and so many walls to run one\u2019s fingers along.\n\nIf time seems to speed up as we get older, it\u2019s because we unconsciously decide that we have, in most areas, already noticed everything that it would be significant and charming to see. We walk to the park \u2013 and around the globe \u2013 with a blindfold. Our days get emptier because we perceive ever less in them. There is no need to look too closely at trees anymore, or our partner\u2019s hands or the cloud formations in mid-afternoon. Matters that would have detained us at the age of 4 lose all definition, until we discover with horror that it is autumn again and we don\u2019t know where another year has gone.\n\nThe difference between living and living consciously is like the difference between swallowing something at once and chewing it at length. We don\u2019t need to be poets or artists to digest our experiences more thoroughly, but we can learn from these disciplines about how to study the world and bottle and preserve its most valuable moments (so that the smell of foxgloves and the song of a thrush will still be alive in us in early February).\n\nWe can live more consciously, too, around painful events. Here we can try to slow time\u2019s dispersal with a web of questions: what lies behind our fear of people who like us too intensely? Why do we get so irritated by cynicism? Where is this present sadness about work rooted?\n\nOnce we master the art of conscious living, we can afford to be a little less concerned with how long our lives will be. Another decade more or less won\u2019t have to be the decisive matter when it lies permanently in our power to densify time, and when we can find the amount of content more normally associated with a month in the bounds of a single day. We can slow the reductive march of the clock with the tendrils of our own sensitivity. We should perhaps stop asking how old people are and focus on a more telling and more accurate measure of their time on earth: how consciously they are living.",

It is not a disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgement of how much pain we must all inevitably travel through.\n\nModern society tends to emphasise buoyancy and cheerfulness. It is impatient with melancholy states, and wishes either to medicalise \u2013 and therefore \u2018solve\u2019 \u2013 them, or deny their legitimacy altogether.\n\nMelancholy links pain with wisdom and beauty. It springs from a rightful awareness of the tragic structure of every life. In melancholy states, we can understand without fury or sentimentality that no one truly understands anyone else, that loneliness is universal, and that every life has its full measure of shame and sorrow. The melancholy know that many of the things we most want are in tragic conflict: to feel secure, and yet to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be beholden to others; to be in close-knit communities and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of society; to travel and explore the world and yet to put down deep roots; to fulfil the demands of our appetites for food, exploration and sloth \u2013 and yet stay thin, sober, faithful and fit.\n\nThe wisdom of the melancholy attitude (as opposed to the bitter or angry one) lies in the understanding that we have not been singled out; that our suffering belongs to humanity in general. Melancholy is marked by an impersonal take on suffering. It is filled with pity for the human condition.\n\nThere are melancholy landscapes and melancholy pieces of music, melancholy poems and melancholy times of day. In them, we find echoes of our own griefs, returned back to us without some of the personal associations that, when they first struck us, made them particularly agonising.\n\nThe task of culture is to turn both rage and its disguised twin, jolliness, into melancholy.\n\nThe more melancholy a culture can be, the less its individual members need to be persecuted by their own failures, lost illusions and regrets.\n\nWhen it can be shared, melancholy is the beginning of friendship.",

They were highly engineered machines for helping their inhabitants to think. They were begun because certain people wanted to think very carefully about a range of vital questions: what is the nature of God and what does God want from me? What is the divine and what is grace? What is owed to Jesus and what is owed to Caesar?\n\nThese believers realised that the human mind is an extremely flighty and easily distracted organ. The prospect of a party at the end of the week, the chatter of a few people out in the street, the sight of an exciting book \u2013 all these can derail our attempts to focus our minds.\n\nSo, the founders of monasteries went to immense efforts to create environments that could positively assist their members to think fruitfully. They situated their buildings far from cities; they built high walls around their estates; they laid out highly symmetrical gardens and walkways; they made sure their food was nutritious but plain. They encouraged only quiet conversation over meals. They went to bed early and rose at dawn. They did moderate exercise every other day.\n\nToday, we probably don\u2019t want to think so much about the particular questions that monks and nuns once focused on. However, we still have a lot of thinking to do. We have equally important thinking tasks to perform around relationships, work and the meaning of our lives.\n\nFor these challenges, monasteries retain some important lessons for us. We can be inspired by their ambition to go beyond ordinary expectations and set up ideal conditions where a person might think as well as possible. This contrasts with a more Romantic attitude that sees thinking as mainly influenced by other thoughts \u2013 particularly by books \u2013 and doesn\u2019t quite accept that an organ as elevated as the mind may be assisted by something as ostensibly trivial as going for a walk or having only a light salad for lunch.\n\nIn the Utopia, we should learn to design our own highly engineered machines for thinking \u2013 institutions geared to the task of deftly extracting our best thoughts from our squeamish and recalcitrant minds.",

The idea that we have the freedom to fashion our own destinies as we please has become central to our contemporary worldview: we are encouraged to imagine that we can, with time, create exactly the lives we desire, around our relationships, our work and our existence more generally. This hopeful scenario has been the source of extraordinary and unnecessary suffering.\n\nThere are many things we desperately want to avoid, which we will spend huge parts of our lives worrying about and that we will then bitterly resent when they force themselves upon us, nevertheless.\n\nThe idea of inevitability is central to the natural world: the deciduous tree has to shed its leaves when the temperature dips in autumn; the river must erode its banks; the cold front will deposit its rain; the tide has to rise and fall. The laws of nature are governed by forces nobody chose, no one can resist, and that brook no exception.\n\nWhen we contemplate nature (a forest in the autumn, for example, or the reproductive cycle of a salmon), we are witnessing rules that in their broad irresistible structure apply to ourselves as well. We, too, mature, seek to reproduce, age, fall ill and die. We face a litany of other burdens too: we will never be fully understood by others; we will always be burdened by primordial anxiety; we will never fully know what it is like to be someone else; we will invariably fantasise about more than we can have; we will realise that in key ways we cannot be who we want to be.\n\nWhat we most fear will happen irrespective of our wishes. But when we see frustration as a law of nature, we drain it of some of its sting and bitterness. We recognise that limitations are not in any way unique to us. In awesome, majestic scenes (the life cycle of an elephant; the eruption of a volcano), nature moves us away from our habitual tendency to personalise and rail against our suffering.\n\nA central task of culture should be to remind us that the laws of nature apply to us as well as to trees, clouds and cliff faces. Our goal is to become clearer about where our own tantalisingly powerful, yet always limited agency stops, and where we will be left with no option but to bow to forces infinitely greater than our own.",

But for the most part, we never stop to analyse or make sense of these. It seems too painful and difficult, because there is always an extra degree of anxiety that attends the process of beginning to think \u2013 whatever the eventual benefits.\n\nHowever, the weight of our unthought thoughts and unfelt feelings can grow unbearable over time. They take their revenge on us for not giving them the attention they deserve. They wake us up in the middle of the night demanding to be heard; they give us twitches and, one day perhaps, serious illnesses. These neglected feelings and thoughts deserve to be examined and unfurled, for they contain a host of clues as to our future direction and needs. They are not merely clutter, as they might seem under a Buddhist lens; they are the jumbled jigsaw pieces of a future, better self.\n\nIt is in order to get a handle on the contents of our minds that we require the practice of Philosophical Meditation. Philosophical Meditation proposes that we regularly set aside a portion of time and systematically set ourselves to answer in detail three core questions: What am I currently anxious about that I haven\u2019t properly acknowledged? What am I upset or hurt about that I haven\u2019t yet fully understood? And what am I currently excited about that I haven\u2019t yet clearly identified or had the courage to integrate into my ambitions?\n\nThe practice is built on the notion that our brains won\u2019t manage to understand their own content without a considerable degree of artifice and training. We need to establish habits that can regularly prompt us to undertake the arduous work of figuring out what is going on in our own minds.",

There are the standard, conventional-sounding answers: we check our phones to see if any messages might have come in, if someone posted an interesting video, if something dreadful has happened overseas.\n\nBut this is in danger of sounding far too normal and too kind to us. The truth is a lot darker and rather more humbling. We don\u2019t pick up our phones to find out what\u2019s going on, we pick them up to ensure \u2013 with considerable ruthlessness \u2013 that we are in no danger of finding out anything more about ourselves.\n\nIf we forensically study the moments when we are drawn to pick up our devices, these are almost always when some kind of anxiety is pressing in on us \u2013 an anxiety on whose analysis and interpretation the correct navigation of our lives may depend. We are using our devices as an alternative to thinking about our futures, we employ our machines to block insight, to halt the business of processing, to alienate our minds from their most promising and complex substrata.\n\nThe thoughts attempting to break into consciousness might be about our mother and the strange thing she said to us over lunch. Or about an unkind and sharp word our partner had with us this morning, which threatens to throw our relationship into question once again.\n\nHow convenient that we should have invented a device to ensure that we will never have to meet ourselves again, and how darkly ironic that we should blithely refer to it as, of all things, an instrument of communication.\n\nWe take pride in the time we\u2019ve saved, the dictionaries we don\u2019t have to consult, the atlases we can throw away, the many strange and funny things we have discovered. And yet we ignore the reveries we haven\u2019t entertained, the ideas we\u2019ve not hatched, the feelings we\u2019ve not identified, the self-awareness we\u2019ve lost.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t need to be the end of the story. Precisely when we most want to pick up our phones, we should learn to do something very unusual; pause and ask ourselves a bold question: if I wasn\u2019t allowed to consult my phone right now, what might I need to think about?\n\nThe answer can provide us with nothing less than a royal road into our unexamined lives. Rather than using our phones to stop ourselves from thinking, we can study our craving for them as a guide to when and where we particularly need to introspect.",

      "content": "## Plan B\n\nWe grow up \u2013 inevitably \u2013 with a strong attachment to a plan A, that is, an idea of how our lives will go and what we need to do to achieve our particular set of well-defined goals. For example, we\u2019ll do four years of law school, then move out west, buy a house and start a family. Or, we\u2019ll go to medical school for seven years, then go to another country and train in our specialty of interest and hope to retire by 50. Or we\u2019ll get married and raise two children with an emphasis on the outdoors and doing good in the world.\n\nBut then, for some of us \u2013 and at one level all of us \u2013 life turns out to have made a few other plans. A sudden injury puts a certain career forever out of reach. A horrible and unexpected bit of office politics blackens our name and forces us out of our professional path. We discover an infidelity or make a small but significant error which changes everything about how crucial others view us.\n\nAnd so, promptly, we find we have to give up on plan A altogether. The realisation can feel devastating. Sobbing or terrified, we wonder how things could have turned out this way. By what piece of damnation has everything come to this? Who could have predicted that the lively and hopeful child we once were would have to end up in such a forlorn and pitiful situation? We alternately weep and rage at the turn of events.\n\nIt is for such moments that we should, even when things appear calm and hopeful, consider one of life\u2019s most vital skills: that of developing a plan B.\n\nThe first element involves fully acknowledging that we are never cursed for having to make a plan B. Plan As simply do not work out all the time. No one gets through life with all their careful plan As intact. Something unexpected, shocking and abhorrent regularly comes along, not only to us, but to all human beings. We are simply too exposed to accidents, too lacking in information, too frail in our capacities, to avoid some serious avalanches and traps.\n\nThe second point is to realise that we are, despite moments of confusion, eminently capable of developing very decent plan Bs. The reason why we often don\u2019t trust that we can is that children can\u2019t so easily \u2013 and we all continue to be influenced by childhood in ways it\u2019s hard to recognise. When children\u2019s plans go wrong, they can\u2019t do much in response: they have to stay at the same school, they can\u2019t divorce their parents, they can\u2019t move to another country. They\u2019re locked in and immobile.\n\nBut adults are not at all this way, a glorious fact which we keep needing to refresh in our minds and draw comfort from in anxious moments. We have enormous capacities to act and to adapt. The path ahead may be blocked, but we have notable scope to find other routes through. One door may close, but there truly are many other entrances to try. We do not have only one way through this life, even if \u2013 at times \u2013 we cling very fervently to a picture of how everything should and must be.\n\nWe\u2019re a profoundly adaptable species. Perhaps we\u2019ll have to leave town forever, maybe we\u2019ll have to renounce an occupation we spent a decade nurturing, perhaps it will be impossible to remain with someone in whom we\u2019d invested a lot \u2026\n\nIt can feel desperate \u2013 until we rediscover our latent plan B muscle. In reality, there would be a possibility to relocate, to start afresh in another domain, to find someone else, to navigate around the disastrous event. There was no one script for us written at our birth, and nor does there need to be only one going forward.\n\nIt helps, in flexing our plan B muscles, to acquaint ourselves with the lives of many others who had to throw away plan As and begin anew: the person who thought they\u2019d be married forever, then suddenly weren\u2019t \u2013 and coped; the person who was renowned in their career, then had to start over in a dramatically different field \u2013 and made it.\n\nAmidst these stories, we\u2019re liable to find a few people who will tell us, very sincerely, that their plan B ended up, in the end, superior to their plan A. They worked harder for it, they had to dig deeper to find it and it carried less vanity and fear within it.\n\nCrucially, we don\u2019t need to know right now what our plan Bs might be. We should simply feel confident that we will, if and when we need to, be able to work them out. We don\u2019t need to ruminate on them or anticipate every frustration that might come our way; we should simply feel confident that, were the universe to command it, we would know how to find a very different path.",

It is a deliberate, artful, ritualised meditation on varied options for upcoming disasters.\n\nThe practice is based on the view that our minds are congenitally unable to face up to the risks we face and do us an enormous disservice through their sentimental, unexamined optimism, leaving us unprepared for the catastrophes that will inevitably come our way. A premeditation constitutes a deliberate attempt to bring our expectations into line with the troubles we face. It builds on a fundamental idea about anger: that we don\u2019t get angry simply because something bad has happened; we grow furious only when it is bad and unexpected.\n\nThe Stoic philosopher Seneca believed that the greatest service we can pay ourselves is to crush hope. Here is an example of a Senecan premeditation:\n\nThe wise will start each day with the thought: fortune gives us nothing which we can really own. Whatever has been built up over years is scattered and dispersed in a single day. No, he who has said \u2018a day\u2019 has granted too long; an hour, an instant, suffices for the overthrow of empires. Look at your wrists, a falling tile could cut them. Look at your feet, a paving stone could render you unable to walk again. We live in the middle of things that have all been destined to be damaged and to die. Mortal have you been born, to mortals have you given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything.\n\nOf course, premeditation doesn\u2019t remove the bad things. But by getting us to admit, frankly and bravely, that we are likely to encounter hell one day, it can leave us a little less distraught when it eventually comes our way.\n\nIdeally, our culture would do some of the work of premeditation for us: it would constantly feed us \u2013 through a wise emotional education delivered via culture \u2013 certain realistic ideas about the sadly demanding and radically imperfect nature of existence. But until it can overcome its congenital sentimentality, we should take care never to start the day without our own private premeditation.",

Novelty and change are centrally prestigious notions; we\u2019re eager to explore new places, ideas and opportunities. This attitude comes into particular focus around the status we accord to \u2018the news\u2019, a medium that fundamentally equates novelty with importance.\n\nCorrespondingly, we assume there could be nothing more ridiculous than repeating an old idea again and again. Repetition sounds boring and irksome, like the worst experiences of childhood education. But other cultures have taken a different and perhaps wiser view; they have had a high regard for repetition. They have created aesthetically compelling occasions where the same lesson has been rehearsed again and again. Across the globe and through time, it is particularly religions that have been concerned with getting people to repeat ideas. Zen Buddhists have looked at the moon every autumn and written poems in its honour on a set day; Jews will take time to appreciate spring according to a ritual requirement of their holy calendar; Catholics are required to ritually examine their consciences every Sunday; in Russia, orthodox ritual demanded that before a long journey, everyone would meditate briefly on the possibility of never seeing each other again.\n\nWhat fired the religious devotion to ritual was the realisation that if the goal was to change minds and behaviour (and thereby change the world), once was never going to be enough.\n\nIn a secular age, the deep link between religion and ritual has served to cast the very concept of repetition into shadow. This is unfair. In the Utopia, the most important ideas would keep being reinforced via aesthetically compelling rituals. On a regular basis, we would be reminded of the importance of forgiveness, appreciation, self-knowledge and kindness. It\u2019s not that we ever actively disagree with such ideas; we simply forget to act upon them in practice. We need rituals to ensure that we properly listen to the significance of all the old things we half-know already, but avoid properly putting into practice, nevertheless.",

Our age believes in big pleasures. We have inherited a Romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find, exotic, or unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. We subtly like high prices. If something is cheap or free, it\u2019s a little harder to appreciate. We are mostly focused on large schemes that we hope will deliver substantial enjoyment: marriage, career, travel and the purchase of a house.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t wholly wrong, but it unwittingly exhibits a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary, the familiar and the small-scale.\n\nThe paradoxical aspect of pleasure is how promiscuous it proves to be. It doesn\u2019t neatly collect in the most expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us on grand holidays. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods.\n\nA pleasure may look very minor \u2013 eating a fig, whispering in bed in the dark, talking to a grandparent, or scanning through old photos \u2013 and yet be anything but. If properly grasped and elaborated upon, these sorts of activities may be among the most moving and satisfying we can have.\n\nAppreciating what is to hand isn\u2019t a defence of failure; it isn\u2019t an attack on ambition. But there is no point in chasing the future until and unless we are attuned to the modest moments and things that are available to us already.\n\nThe smallness of a pleasure isn\u2019t really an assessment of how much it has to offer us: it is a reflection of how many good things the world unfairly neglects. A small pleasure is a great pleasure in waiting; it is a true source of joy that has not yet received the collective acknowledgement it is due.",

That can mean that we love to tan, visit an island, go to the beach, read a book, sip a drink and perhaps play volleyball. The problem with this approach is not that we are using too grand a term to refer to what is at heart a rather trivial and almost embarrassing enthusiasm; it\u2019s that we\u2019re arguably making far too little of, and neglecting properly to ritualise or deepen, an orientation that should lie close to the meaning of our lives.\n\nHowever crowded our beaches may be, in modernity, our love of the sun is for the most part a psychologically shallow and unexplored commitment. Most ancient cultures didn\u2019t merely favour a tan, they worshipped the sun in and of itself, regularly bowing before it as the most potent force in the universe, to which they owed gratitude, obedience and adoration. From their sumptuous sun temples spread out along the length of the Nile, the Egyptians paid homage to the deity Ra (\u2018sun\u2019), depicted in their sculpture as a falcon-headed god with a solar disc over his head. The Aztecs incanted sacred poetry to Tonatiuh, the sun god and leader of heaven \u2013 while the ancient Celts, under less auspicious skies, expressed piety to Grannus, god both of the sun and, appropriately enough, of wisdom.\n\nScience has taught us enough about the constituents of our distant hydrogen and helium explosion for us not to be able to deify the sun in literal terms. But the star can still occupy a place in our symbolic pantheon, where it may hold pride of place as the supreme emblem of something that no life can subsist for long without: hope.\n\nMost of us have only a tenuous hold on our sources of hope. Despair stalks us relentlessly, especially in the darkness of the early hours. There seem, on many days, so many reasons to give up and surrender to self-loathing. This is why the sun is not merely nice, it is an ally in our mind\u2019s constant attempts to structure arguments why it might, after all, be worth keeping going. Maybe there can be an end to the anxiety. Perhaps the project will work out eventually. A lot of things could, in the end, be more or less OK. Such mental explorations the sun seems to reward and generously bolster.\n\nTo compensate for our many days of gloom, we should \u2013 without any overtly spiritual intent but with a good atheist\u2019s appropriate sense of wonder \u2013 practise an exercise of bowing down to the sun, closing our lids against its reviving rays, and reciting all the reasons we might still hold on to hope, despite every argument (too often well-rehearsed at night) why we might give up.",

      "content": "## The Sublime\n\nThe sublime refers to an experience of vastness (of space, age, time) beyond calculation or comprehension \u2013 a sense of awe we might feel before an ocean, a glacier, the earth from a plane or a starry sky.\n\nIn the presence of the sublime, we are made to feel desperately small. In most of life, a sense of our smallness is experienced as a humiliation \u2013 when it happens, for example, at the hands of a professional enemy or a concierge. But the impression of smallness that unfolds in the presence of the sublime has an oddly uplifting and profoundly redemptive effect. We are granted an impression of our complete nullity and insignificance in a grander scheme, which relieves us from an often oppressive sense of the seriousness of all our ambitions and desires and of all our rivals and heroes. We welcome being put back in our place and not having to take ourselves quite so seriously \u2013 not least because the agent doing so is as noble and awe-inspiring as a 10,000-year-old ice sheet or a volcano on the surface of Mars.\n\nThings that have up until now been looming in our minds (what\u2019s gone wrong with the Seville office, a colleague\u2019s cold behaviour, the disagreement about patio furniture) is usefully cut down in size. Local, immediate sorrows are reduced; none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes has very much significance for a time. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. We are granted a perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.\n\nBits of our egoism and pride seem less impressive. We may be moved to be more tolerant, less wrapped up in our own concerns. We\u2019re reminded of our fragility and transient occupation of the world, which can move us to focus on what\u2019s genuinely important, while there is still time. The sublime foregrounds a sense of equality, which we can otherwise find it hard to hold onto. In the face of vast things, the grades of human status lose meaning. The CEO and the intern are equally transient arrangements of atoms.\n\nOur reversals matter less as well. We become more alive to the impersonal, implacable forces that erode all aspects of nature and, hence, all our lives. Like the cliffs under the pressure of the raging oceans, our plans will collapse and fail. Our griefs are universal and unavoidable. The intense burden of the unfairness of existence is reduced.\n\nCrucially, the sublime isn\u2019t just an idea; it\u2019s a piece of applied philosophy experienced via the senses. The mere idea of our own littleness won\u2019t impact upon us just as an abstract proposition. We have to feel it; we have to stand at the edge of the ocean with the wind raging about us or see the Singapore Straits from thirty thousand feet at dawn. The importance of a sensory impression reveals a general truth about how our minds work: pure ideas are feeble tools for affecting human conduct; we can too easily shrug off words. This is why art and travel are ideal resources of culture. At their best, they integrate thought and feeling: the good idea they are seeking to teach us is delivered in the way we need \u2013 wrapped up in powerful sensory emotions.\n\nWe need not just the idea of cliffs; for philosophy to work its proper effect, we need regularly to take the whole of ourselves out to them.",

We squander some of our best possibilities to the quiet, unheralded tragedy of procrastination.\n\nOur shame at the scale of our procrastination is part of the problem. We\u2019re already so guilty about what we\u2019re not doing that the very thought of examining our errors and taking action feels unbearable. It seems as if we have procrastinated far too much to deserve a new start.\n\nWe should be less hard on ourselves \u2013 and in the process, less fatalistic about the chances of change. Procrastination is a design flaw of the human animal, not an appalling and unique personal failing. We need to consider the problem rationally, talk about it openly and learn to take small, manageable steps to attenuate its worst ills.\n\nThe goal is not to remove procrastination altogether, but to understand its roots, appreciate when it may strike and work out its hold on us, so that we can plot a nimble path around it. Having learnt the art of managing our procrastination, we\u2019ll still sometimes spend slightly too long on the sofa, but we will have opened up a major new possibility: that of eventually dying with fewer regrets.",

      "content": "## Fear & Procrastination\n\nWe tend to account for why we procrastinate with a deeply convincing and hugely punitive explanation: we don\u2019t get down to tasks because we are lazy. We don\u2019t do what we should because we are, in essence, self-indulgent, slothful and (underneath it all) surely rather bad people.\n\nThe truth is more complicated, at once psychologically more nuanced and more worthy of sympathy. The real reason we are indolent is not so much because we are lazy as because we are scared. What we blithely call being lazy is really a symptom and consequence of anxiety.\n\nOddly, it tends to be very easy to get down to work on things that don\u2019t matter very much. Their lack of importance encourages our lighter, more carefree and more productive sides. We find we\u2019re done with them in no time and it doesn\u2019t even feel like work; it\u2019s closer to play.\n\nYet the stuff that really counts, that we need to complete because our lives may depend on it, terrifies us into inactivity. We are so scared of failure that we don\u2019t dare to make a start. At least if we leave the task untouched, we won\u2019t need to face any risk of humiliating incapacity or incompetence.\n\nThis analysis points to how we might increase our productivity. We would be advised not to remind ourselves (or get others to remind us) of how important a task may be: we know this full well already and that is precisely the problem.\n\nWhat we need to do is to stress its relative unimportance in the grander scheme. So what if, in the end, we don\u2019t get the job, or lose the contract, or are thought an idiot by people we care about? It happens, and it\u2019s survivable. We mustn\u2019t ramp up the pressure; we must strive to turn the task from a horrifying ordeal to the only thing we\u2019ll know how to deal with calmly and energetically: a piece of play.\n\nLessening the imagined consequences of messing up liberates us to devote to a task all the energy and talent we actually possess.",

      "content": "## Squeaky Hinges\n\nIn Laurence Sterne\u2019s great novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (the first parts of which were published in 1759), there\u2019s an episode in which one of the characters reveals that in his house, there\u2019s a squeaky door hinge that has annoyed him for over ten years. That\u2019s rather a long time to leave a hinge unattended, given that it would take only a minute with some oil to correct the problem. Yet we all have such hinges in our lives.\n\nJoshua Reynolds, Laurence Sterne, 1760\n\nIt\u2019s a theme of great pathos: we are plagued by minor irritants that we don\u2019t get around to sorting out. We neglect to replace a light bulb, we don\u2019t refill the windscreen wiper fluid, a button is left hanging by a thread, we don\u2019t repaint a wall.\n\nPart of the problem is that we are snobs about happiness: the issue is so small, and yet we operate with a sense that our contentment must be made up of enormous and prestigious elements (more money, a bigger house, a grand job). We leave the hinge or the button unattended because we can\u2019t imagine that our moods could be hostage to such trivial features.\n\nBut generously considered, a lot of how we feel is in fact determined by \u2018minor things\u2019. We insist on a heroic view of our lives, in which great transformations are all that matter, and neglect how much \u2013 cumulatively \u2013 the small things add up.\n\n\u2018Small things\u2019 include not just household items, but also minor dynamics in our relationships with ourselves and others. For half a lifetime, we may neglect to discuss with a partner how their way of alluding to our mother irritates us or how much we would prefer them not to cut bread a certain way. We may spend decades avoiding a certain kind of introspection or moment of self-knowledge. We are heedless in the way we plan for happiness. The tasks we need to take on include not just the large prestigious ones around status and work; we should focus on a fair number of squeaky hinges too.",

These busy people evade a different order of undertaking: they go in for what we might call emotional procrastination. They are practically a hive of activity, yet they don\u2019t get round to working out what they really feel about a loss. They constantly delay the investigation of their own responses to an insult. They procrastinate when it comes to understanding particular feelings about a partner. They nip along to an exhibition but don\u2019t get around to thinking what the art means to them; they catch up regularly with friends but don\u2019t get round to considering what the point of a particular friendship might be.\n\nTheir busy-ness is in fact a subtle but powerful form of distraction.

      "content": "## Gazing out of the Window\n\nWe tend to reproach ourselves for gazing out of the window. You are supposed to be working, or studying, or ticking off things on your to-do list. It can seem almost the definition of wasted time. It appears to produce nothing, to serve no purpose. We equate it with boredom, distraction, futility. The act of cupping your chin in your hands near a pane of glass and letting your eyes drift in the middle distance does not normally enjoy high prestige. We don\u2019t go around saying: \u2018I had a great day: the high point was staring out of the window\u2019. But maybe in a better society, that\u2019s just the sort of thing people would, at points, say to one another.\n\nThe point of staring out of a window is, paradoxically, not to find out what is going on outside. It is, rather, an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds. It\u2019s easy to imagine we know what we think, what we feel and what\u2019s going on in our heads. But we rarely do entirely. There\u2019s a huge amount of what makes us who we are that circulates unexplored and unused. Its potential lies untapped. It is shy and doesn\u2019t emerge under the pressure of direct questioning.\n\nGustave Caillebotte, Young Man at His Window, 1875:we should seek to bring glamour and higher status to an activity that, for centuries, has been condemned and denigrated by moralists, teachers, employers, parents \u2013 and our own guilty consciences.\n\nIf we do it right, staring out the window offers a way for us to listen out for the quieter suggestions and perspectives of our deeper selves.\n\nPlato suggested a metaphor for the mind: our ideas are like birds fluttering around in the aviary of our brains. But in order for the birds to settle, Plato understood that we needed periods of purpose-free calm. Staring out of the window offers such an opportunity. We see the world going on: a patch of weeds is holding its own against the wind; a grey tower block looms through the drizzle. But we don\u2019t need to respond; we have no overarching intentions, and so the more tentative parts of ourselves have a chance to be heard, like the sound of church bells in the city once the traffic has died down at night.\n\nThe potential of daydreaming isn\u2019t recognised by societies obsessed with productivity. But some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful and instead respect the creative potential of reverie. Window daydreaming is a strategic rebellion against the excessive demands of immediate (but ultimately insignificant) pressures \u2013 in favour of the diffuse, but very serious, hard work of discovering the unexplored deep self.",

At each stage we\u2019re conscious that a great deal is going on, but it\u2019s not at all clear how everything fits together: Joyce was trying to convey the confusion of modern existence. His novel, though widely esteemed, has a very limited audience because it rebuffs our appetite for plot. In books, we want to know why something is happening and what it\u2019s going to lead to. We like to be able to trace in simple terms the connections between causes and effects. We don\u2019t much go in for books without a plot.\n\nThis proclivity doesn\u2019t just apply to literature. In life as a whole, things can get very boring \u2013 and therefore very unproductive \u2013 when we lose sight of the plot. Often, oddly enough, we lose the plot of our own lives, and get blocked and unfruitful as a result. We may start to ask ourselves why we should be doing a particular job or why we should be putting so much effort into a relationship. We can wake up one morning and question why we have made particular commitments in love or around family. Across several years of a major project, we may lose sight of quite why what we\u2019re doing matters. We\u2019re not at all sure whether our efforts will ever amount to much, or how what we do week by week contributes to the whole.\n\nCrucially, there may be some very good reasons to keep going; it\u2019s just that they have a habit of getting cloudy in our minds. We need regularly to step back and retrace the plot once more from the start to the present moment. We need to reorient ourselves in the trajectory of our own lives. We need to remind ourselves of the ongoing logic of what we\u2019re meant to be doing and have signed up to. We need to tell the story of our lives in a way that can keep illuminating the purpose of the small and large challenges of the days ahead.",

It\u2019s not as if we can possibly be the only person in the world who suffers from this particular curse. But in practice it mostly feels this way. There\u2019s a tragic, natural asymmetry of knowledge that arises because people normally only procrastinate when alone and out of sight. This means we know our own horrible habits of time-wasting and evasion from the inside. But we see only the smooth, fruitful exteriors of others.\n\nWe catch our colleagues and friends mostly in their more active and engaged moments. We don\u2019t get to see how far they may be falling short of their own ambitions. It may look as if they accomplished quite a lot \u2013 but their private experience can be of tortured frustration, in which they are acutely aware of the gap between their ambitions and their output.\n\nWe need to construct a more accurate and imaginative picture of what others must really be like. Despite the lack of evidence, we need to guess at \u2013 behind the facade of productivity that others present \u2013 the long hours when their minds must have felt stuck in first gear, unable to get going on anything serious or demanding; their failures to confront the hard questions around decisions; the things they must have abandoned because they couldn\u2019t muster the intellectual energy to address them properly; the hours they will have spent online looking up woollen socks or holidays in Thailand.\n\nIt\u2019s still a problem that we procrastinate; but it\u2019s not a unique or even unusual problem.

It\u2019s so far short of what we would ideally want it to be, we fall into despair and put our tools down.

When he was supposed to be painting a majestic sunset, he would often be procrastinating by pencilling a few erotic scenes.

But actually Ruskin did us a disservice. He tried to hide from the world a crucial bit of evidence: even a hugely accomplished and successful artist like Turner was plagued by a tendency towards dithering and avoidance of real work through the use of sexual imagery.\n\nRuskin\u2019s censorship dissuaded us from considering how common it is for our procrastination to adopt an embarrassing but not inherently shameful form: sexual fantasy.

      "content": "## Existential Angst\n\nA boy of seven is in a toy shop with his grandmother, who is going to buy him a present. He\u2019s trying to make up his mind. He could get some special pieces of Lego, which opens a vista of the spaceship he\u2019d be able to make. Or he could get a wooden swing bridge that he could drive his model cars across \u2013 and engineer amazing accidents with. But he can\u2019t have both.\n\nThe result of this need to choose is indecision and a degree of agony. The boy asks his grandmother if they might come back another day. Until he decides, both prospects remain possible. It\u2019s only when he actually opts for one or the other that the fatal moment will arrive. Whichever he chooses, he\u2019ll be losing the other \u2013 and the special zone of happiness it promises. It\u2019s a difficult moment. His grandmother is doing her best to please him, but he\u2019s plunged into the agony of choice: he\u2019s confronting what philosophers have called Existential Angst.\n\nIn 1843, the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (who developed the term Angst) published a book called Either/Or. His thesis was that life constantly forces us towards decisions: we can marry and be constrained, or be free but miss out on cosy long-term companionship; we can be sober and thoughtful but cut off from our times, or we can join in, be sociable \u2013 but know at the back of our minds that we are wasting our lives; we can seek fame and money and get very stressed, or we can opt for a quiet life but always be haunted by the idea that we\u2019re eluding our real possibilities. Kierkegaard made another observation: the difficulty of choosing means that many of us spend our lives avoiding choice, which ends up being a kind of choice all of its own. There is, in his eyes, no alternative but to face choice and the compromise that every choice entails. Procrastination isn\u2019t merely a delay; it\u2019s a symptom of not recognising that we humans have to choose and always lose out through choice.\n\nWe procrastinate, at times, in a desperate attempt to keep at bay the cruel limitations of reality. If we move city, we might have new work prospects, but we\u2019ll lose our current friends; if we devote ourselves to one specific career, other sides of our character will be neglected; if we break off a relationship, we\u2019ll be free, but we\u2019ll lose all the sweeter moments we have with this person.\n\nIf we delay choosing, all options appear to stay alive, at least as possibilities \u2013 but only for a while. Yet that is a grave illusion. We should quell our procrastination by accepting that not choosing is in itself a choice and that every choice will necessarily mean missing out on something important. We should get better and faster at making decisions, sure in the knowledge that (as Existential philosophers teach us) every decision will be in its own way slightly wrong and somewhat sad.",

      "content": "## Psychoanalysis\n\nA central idea of psychoanalysis is that the troubles of adult life often have important roots in childhood. We may have initiated a way of acting and feeling at a young age as a way of coping with what was then a very serious challenge. But we tend then to stick to this emotional pattern in later life, even when it\u2019s no longer actually needed and brings with it some considerable costs.\n\nAround procrastination, psychoanalysis might ask a strange-sounding, but helpful, question: why might a child find it useful to fail to make headway with a project or to hold back from applying their best abilities in a concerted way? Why might a child want to delay? And by extension, why might the adult version of this child keep sabotaging their work?\n\nThe answer is that there must once have been some sense of danger associated with getting things done. Not procrastinating was a risk. Perhaps accomplishment was seen as showing off; perhaps there was a rivalrous older sibling ready to attack any signs of excellence. Maybe a fragile, competitive parent felt threatened by their own child\u2019s success or an anxious parent was panicked by the slightest sign of failure, of the kind that accomplishment demands in its early stages. In such circumstances a child could learn to sabotage their own capacities: they might feel it was too dangerous to properly concentrate and push their powers \u2013 and might stall and hold back instead.\n\nPsychoanalysis promises us that, by becoming aware of childhood dynamics, we can liberate ourselves from the past. The rivalrous older sibling now lives in another country (and we get on with them well enough). A competitive fragile parent is now dead. There is no need to keep playing out the defensive strategies that we developed in relation to threats that no longer exist. We can dare to get down to work, take our time and succeed \u2013 without a fear that our accomplishment will threaten anyone we love.",

      "content": "## The Monastery\n\nMonasteries were developed to help people concentrate their minds. In a sense, they were giant, beautiful machines to assist us in avoiding procrastination. They started from a usefully pessimistic assumption: we are naturally very easily drawn off course and need all the help we can get to devote ourselves to the tasks to which we are, theoretically, committed.\n\nMonasteries carefully incorporated a range of features to assist us in avoiding procrastination. They were usually located in remote places \u2013 to keep at bay the temptations of the town. They had codes of silence \u2013 to restrict gossip. They regulated every moment of the day \u2013 to combat idleness. Monks had little or no personal money \u2013 so thoughts of shopping did not distract them. They were required to constantly meditate on death and the brevity of life \u2013 to foster a sense of urgency. They had a system of regular confession and spiritual supervision \u2013 so that time-wasting tendencies could be properly recognised and cured. The walls of the monastery were extremely thick \u2013 to avoid distracting sounds. There were pleasant walkways under covered arches \u2013 because some of our best ideas come to us when we are pacing.\n\nThe polar opposite of the monastery is the home office, a place designed to maximise distraction and incentives to sloth: no one is watching us; there is a bed and a fridge temptingly close by; we could do the laundry or repaint the bathroom or solve eighteen sudoku puzzles in a row. Or, of course, we could look up Turner\u2019s erotic images. The home office makes a flattering, but fatal, error: it assumes that we are by nature inclined to work and only need more freedom to unleash our productive potential.\n\nMonasteries are there to remind us that, if we are to think and achieve to a high standard, we may need to make a lot of changes to our routines and the structure of our lives. We shouldn\u2019t just blame our willpower. We can blame the whole architectural and social set-up around the way we work.",

In order to squeeze such an achievement out of himself, he developed an exceptionally eccentric working routine. He couldn\u2019t normally write during the day, so he would sleep during the morning and again in the evening and get up around 1 am. He put on a large monastic robe with a hood and wrote through the hours of darkness \u2013 often until around eight in the morning. As he worked, he drank around fifty cups of coffee (mixed with chocolate and brandy; this had an immense effect on his brain: \u2018Ideas quick-march into motion like battalions of a grand army\u2019).\n\nIf he\u2019d been forced to work under standard conditions in an office during normal business hours, or had to wear normal clothes, if he\u2019d been forbidden from taking his special drink... he would (we can well imagine) have been deeply unproductive. Balzac\u2019s enormous output wasn\u2019t a reflection of a freakish absence of the desire to procrastinate; rather, it depended on the strategies he adopted for combating his own resistance to work. He took his procrastination very seriously and was willing to go to dramatic lengths to overcome it.\n\nOur own productivity might be transformed if \u2013 like Balzac \u2013 we were to follow our odder instincts and properly shape our lives around the real requirements of our working temperament.",

We are hugely dependent on someone else \u2013 a boss, a supervisor, a client, an editor or perhaps a parent \u2013 to impose a demand and threaten (in however civil a guise) to punish us for a failure to deliver on time. We might feel resentful, we might have to stay up late or make frantic efforts up to the last minute, we might curse the guardian of the deadline \u2013 but we almost certainly get the work done and are privately a bit grateful for the supervision.\n\nUnfortunately, only a few of the important tasks in life carry deadlines. For much of what truly matters, there\u2019s no one to boss us around; no one appears to care. Our work is not expected at any particular point.\n\nIn dealing with a difficult client, a senior colleague might suggest a definite timeline and precise questions to ask. But there isn\u2019t a clear deadline around taking steps to resolve a tricky issue in a relationship. There\u2019s no one to say: \u2018You must have dinner with your partner tonight and ask these five questions and listen very carefully to the answers without interrupting. We\u2019ll discuss them in the morning and frame a good response.\u2019 No one has given us a deadline to work out what job we should really be doing, or how we might best resolve a conflict in our family. There are no deadlines around getting on better with your children or identifying how to be creative. And so these thorny, vital issues have a habit of getting sidelined and ignored.\n\nPainfully \u2013 but productively \u2013 what we need to do is to create deadlines for ourselves. We need to become our own inner bosses. Furthermore, we have to tell others about our intentions and figuratively sign them up to expect a specific amount of progress from us by a particular date. We have to invite a degree of nagging from people with no prior interest in delivering it \u2013 because this is better than the alternative: wasting our lives. Finally, we need to keep the ultimate deadline always in mind, perhaps by positioning a skull or an X-ray of a cancerous pancreas prominently on our desks.",

One way to break paralysis around an unpleasant task is to introduce an even more unpleasant task, by comparison to which the first task starts to seem more appealing. A good way to start work on a tedious report is, therefore, to raise the spectre of a long-delayed thank-you letter or phone call to a tedious but kindly relative.\n\n2. Work offline as much as possible; the internet is \u2013 plainly \u2013 the enemy.\n\n3. Use an egg timer: work for fifteen minutes and not a moment more. If that doesn\u2019t help, try five minutes. Humiliate yourself into finding a unit of time you can stick to. It might be only a minute and a half. It often is.\n\n4. Use starkly accurate working titles for your efforts: \u2018First Rubbish Version\u2019; \u2018Second Marginally Less Rubbish Version\u2019; \u2018Initial Pathetic Sketch\u2019. Don\u2019t expect it to be right for a long time. If ever.\n\n5. Break a task into 100 sections. Note what percentage is done. For a 1,500-word report, every sentence is pretty much 1%.\n\n6.

      "content": "## In Praise of Procrastination\n\nWe\u2019re so alive to the problems of procrastination that we can overlook the fact that there might be a few things to value in the condition. Precisely speaking, the word procrastination only means waiting, until tomorrow \u2013 or a more distant day. And sometimes, at least, that\u2019s a very wise and helpful thing to do.\n\nCherry trees, for example, procrastinate a lot. It might be five or seven years before a new tree bears fruit. An olive tree might require twelve years. But the fruit that emerges from such slow gestation bears witness to the advantages of procrastination, being rich, experienced and redolent of a succession of long summers and sharp winters.\n\nIt might be a good idea to procrastinate around having sex with someone or around choosing a career; we can be legitimately too young to drive or to leave home, to run our own business or to put up a building.\n\nThere are many important tasks we can\u2019t hurry: we can\u2019t make our children grow up quickly; we can\u2019t write a good novel too fast; we can\u2019t successfully complete psychotherapy in a few days; it can take years to assemble our ideas about how to direct an enterprise or structure a department...\n\nCherry trees in winter\n\nThe French painter Ingres, working in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, dithered for decades over some of his most impressive works. He started his painting of Oedipus and the Sphinx in 1808, when he was in his late twenties, but didn\u2019t complete it until 1827, by which time he was in his late forties.\n\nIngres, Oedipus and the Sphinx, 1808\u20131827\n\nIn the intervening years he changed many details, he repainted some parts many times and he added extra portions of canvas to the top and the sides.\n\nOur society is very good at honouring certain kinds of speed. We\u2019re impressed by how quickly some people can run or drive a car. But we\u2019re much less familiar with the (equally important) idea of honouring those who precisely didn\u2019t do something quickly \u2013 and did it well because they did it very slowly.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC), the brilliant Carthaginian general Hannibal invaded Italy and reached the walls of Rome. Fabius Maximus was appointed to lead the defence of his country, but instead of immediately giving battle, he deliberately kept out of reach of the enemy. He harried their supply lines and kept them on the move and prevented reinforcements arriving. There was minimal bloodshed. Unable to sustain his campaign, Hannibal finally withdrew from the Italian peninsula and the nation was saved. Fabius Maximus procrastinated not out of cowardice or stupidity, but because this was the wiser, more humane and more effective strategy.\n\nBy remembering the trouble impatience brings into our lives, we can gain an unexpected degree of admiration and sympathy for procrastination. It\u2019s not in principle a bad quality \u2013 it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t always use it in the right manner. It\u2019s not so much that we should try to stop procrastinating in all ways; the ideal is to direct our ability to delay to the places where this move is most useful.",

There are many tasks that have been put aside, and many obligations that have been neglected. Achievement mostly depends on not doing a whole host of things that, in a broad and reasonable sense, one really ought to do. The efficient person may be considered deeply lazy in some areas of life; they have been an expert at winnowing their sense of responsibility; they are good at avoiding many details in order to concentrate on just one goal.\n\nThe efficient parent may have heavily neglected the upkeep of the house. The superb accountant may have been a disaster around keeping up with the latest highbrow films and novels. The devoted entrepreneur may have evaded many tricky conversations around their relationship.\n\nA good life doesn\u2019t require us to banish procrastination entirely; it involves making choices about where we will allow ourselves to remain inefficient, in the name of having a shot at excellence elsewhere.",

      "content": "## The Limits of Hard Work\n\nThe Duc de La Rochefoucauld was a seventeenth-century French aristocrat who wrote one of the greatest books of all time, the Maxims, in a few weeks when he was in his early fifties.\n\nThe Maxims is an extremely slender book, composed of only around 500 wise and charming observations, rarely longer than 100 words \u2013 for instance: \u2018If we had no faults we would not find so much enjoyment in seeing faults in others\u2019, or \u2018The world more often rewards the outward signs of merit than merit itself\u2019.\n\nEven more remarkably, writing the book did not cost La Rochefoucauld any great effort, as he briefly hints: \u2018It often happens that things come into the mind in a more finished form than could have been achieved after great study.\u2019 He wrote most of it during tea parties, and he confessed to being a very lazy person, only writing when the mood seized him; and though he never expected it to sell well, it garnered him immediate respect and enduring fame. Voltaire said it was the most important book in French literature, which still seems just about right as a verdict.\n\nTo the bourgeois imagination, this is a scandalous story: La Rochefoucauld didn\u2019t put in long hours, he didn\u2019t work very hard, and yet his little book has been selling well for more than 350 years.\n\nThis violates our cult of hard work, and our firm belief that huge and constant efforts are always at the root of success. We can\u2019t bear the idea of the inspired dandy. It\u2019s become standard to hear anyone who wishes to be seen as a good person emphasising how hard they work \u2013 as if the sheer quantity of time invested will guarantee the worth of what they are, so laboriously, doing.\n\nWe\u2019ve become devoted to the notion that it is only procrastination that is holding us back \u2013 and that we would succeed if only we could force ourselves to work harder.\n\nBut there is a more disturbing thought that we are thereby keeping at bay: that perhaps simply working hard isn\u2019t the decisive factor, that we might work for years and produce nothing good, or (on the other hand) sit around for decades and then \u2013 in a few weeks \u2013 do something that changes history. We fetishise the hours of labour to distract ourselves from a very awkward truth: that sheer hard work often isn\u2019t enough and that, when talent is supreme, one can get away with a lot of \u2018laziness\u2019.",

He went to many parties, he flirted, he chatted away amiably all afternoon and evening. It wasn\u2019t until he was in his late fifties that he published his first important book: a very difficult, but highly influential, treatise on the basic structure of experience called the Critique of Pure Reason. Over the next decade he wrote two more major works, the Critique of Practical Reason (which is about ethics) and the Critique of Judgement (which seeks to answer the question: what is beauty?) Together they established Kant as one of the great thinkers of modern times. Yet it had all come very late indeed (life expectancy for a man of his era was forty-four).\n\nJohann Gottlieb Becker, Immanuel Kant, 1768\n\nWe sometimes use the fact that we have wasted a lot of time as a reason not to begin. It seems impossible that we could be more than halfway through our lives and yet still have a chance to pull off something important: start a family, run a business, invent a machine, write a book or build a house. Tales of late achievers are therefore of particular importance to the self-hating, self-doubting procrastinating ones among us.\n\nWe should not be embarrassed by the amount of time we have wasted sitting on the sofa. It has probably taught us a lot; it has left us with a reservoir of self-disgust we can use to fire our efforts; and it has brought us fruitfully closer to that ultimate deadline to ensure that we now have the motivation to finish our real work before our time is up.\n\nImage credits:Dublin City Gallery, The Huge Lane: Francis Bacon Studio, \u00a9 The Estate of Francis Bacon.

A capacity for self-knowledge is at the heart of our inclinations to forgiveness, kindness, creativity and wise decision-making, especially around love and work. Unfortunately, knowing ourselves is the (always unfinished) task of a lifetime. We are permanently elusive and mysterious to ourselves. We have to catch our real intentions and feelings obliquely, with some of the patience of a lepidopterist.\n\nOne of the tasks of culture is to offer us tools to assist us with the task of self-knowledge. We need a vocabulary to name feelings and states of mind; we need encouragement to be alone with ourselves at regular moments; we need friends and professionals who will listen to us with editorial precision and sympathy, and we need works of art that can illuminate elusive aspects of our psyches.\n\nAbove all, we need to be modest about our capacity easily to understand who we are and what we want. We should nurture a stance of scepticism towards many of our first impulses and beliefs and submit all our significant plans to extensive rational cross-examination.\n\nFailures of self-knowledge lie behind some of our gravest individual and collective disasters.",

We must expect less of people \u2013 not in order to do an injustice to them, but so as to be readier to forgive and accept problems when they arise.

      "content": "### 3. Relationships\n\nRelationships are perhaps our single greatest source of both happiness and suffering. Unlike people in previous ages, we don\u2019t merely seek a partner we can tolerate; we seek someone we can love, usually over many decades, at an intense pitch of desire, commitment and interest. We dream of someone who will understand us, with whom we can share our longings and our secrets, and with whom we can properly be ourselves.\n\nThen the horror begins. We need to understand why. Some of it is because our childhoods leave us with a legacy of trouble around relating to others. We have difficulties trusting or being close, achieving the right distance or staying resilient. We cannot comfortably express what we feel, and are prone to \u2018transfer\u2019 a lot of emotions from the past on to present-day scenarios where they don\u2019t quite belong.\n\nWe need to chart our own psyches and offer maps of our madness to partners early on, before we have had the chance to hurt them too much with our behaviour.\n\nOur current relationship difficulties stem in part from a cultural source that we call \u2018Romanticism\u2019. In the background, we operate with a deeply problematic Romantic picture of what good relationships should be like: we dream of profound intimacy, satisfying sex, an absence of secrets and only a modicum of conflict. This faith in love is touching, but it carries with it a tragic flaw: our expectations turn out to be the enemies of workable mature relationships.\n\nAt The School of Life, we are drawn to what we call a Classical approach to love. The Classical view is in certain ways cautious. Classical people pay special attention to what can go wrong around others. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the standard of partners across society and may interpret a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances. This view of people is fundamentally, but usefully, dark. Ultimately, everyone is deeply troubled and hard to live with. The only people we can think of as normal are those we don\u2019t know very well.",

We have high expectations of this huge part of our lives. Ideally, we want work to be \u2018meaningful\u2019, which involves the belief that we are in some way either reducing the pain or increasing the happiness of other humans.\n\nThree big reasons stand out for why meaningful work has become difficult to secure:\n\nFirstly, it is perilously hard for us to locate our true interests in the time we have before sheer survival becomes an imperative. Our interests don\u2019t manifest themselves spontaneously; they require us to patiently analyse ourselves and try out a range of options, to see what feels like the best \u2018fit\u2019 for us. Unfortunately, schools and universities, as well as society at large, don\u2019t place much emphasis on helping people to understand their authentic working identities. There is far more stress on simply getting ready for any job as opposed to identifying a job that would be particularly well suited to us. This is a pity \u2013 not just for individuals, but for the economy as a whole \u2013 because people work more imaginatively and more fruitfully when their deep selves are engaged.\n\nSecondly, many jobs are relatively meaningless because it\u2019s very possible, in the current economy, to generate profits from selling people things that don\u2019t fundamentally contribute to well-being, but prey instead on their appetites and lack of self-command.\n\nThirdly, a job may have real meaning while not feeling as if it does day to day because many organisations are so large, so slow-moving, and so split up over continents that the purpose of everyone\u2019s work gets lost amid meetings, memos, conference calls and administration.\n\nThis diagnosis helps to point the way to how we could make work more meaningful:\n\nFirstly, pay a lot more attention to helping people find their vocation \u2013 their authentic working selves.\n\nSecondly, the more we, as customers, support businesses engaged in meaningful work, the more meaningful jobs there will be. By raising the quality of demand, we raise the number of occupations that answer to humanity\u2019s deeper needs.\n\nThirdly, in businesses that do carry out meaningful work, but on too large a scale over too long a period for it to feel meaningful, there is scope to narrate stories of the organisation\u2019s purpose that offer a more tangible sense of every individual\u2019s contribution to the whole.\n\nEnsuring that work is meaningful is no luxury. It determines the greatest issue of all in modern economics: how contentedly and how skilfully people will work \u2013 and therefore how successful and fruitful societies can be.",

The School of Life is interested in a kind of capitalism that can target higher needs: that is, a capitalism that is as efficient at meeting our needs for understanding as for sweet things to eat; that is as great at helping us live wisely as it is adept at uniting us with the ideal confectionery or garment.\n\nThe task is to expand the economy so as to help it engage with humanity\u2019s real internal issues, which have usually lain outside the area of commerce as commonly defined.",

Some faith-based ideas (for example, the claim that the soul can be reincarnated, that Christ rose from the dead or that the creator of the cosmos made specific promises about land rights at the eastern end of the Mediterranean) have clouded some highly important psychological practices that religions were adept at promoting. Religions have been machines for addressing a range of important emotional needs, which endure even into a scientific era.\n\nAt their best, religions tried to keep ideas about forgiveness at the front of our minds; encouraged compassion; insisted that certain forms of worldly success were misleading ways of assessing the worth of people; got us to recognise our own capacities to hurt others and to feel sorry for doing so; nudged us to be tender and understanding towards the secret sufferings of others; and gave us helpful rituals and beautiful works of culture to keep important ideas before us throughout the year.\n\nWe see The School of Life as picking up many of the tasks of religion and creating secular substitutes for a range of religious ideals and practices. We believe in the idea that culture can and should replace scripture.\n\n***\n\nThis organisation is, ultimately, a school that believes that the ability to learn is one of the most basic things about human beings. The range of things that we can learn to do better, via instruction, is very wide \u2013 far wider than we tend to think.\n\nThe powerful influence of Romanticism, which is convinced that better emotional responses cannot be taught, means the current education system fails to pass emotional intelligence down the generations as it should.\n\nThe School of Life takes the more Classical view that all important human achievements, especially around emotions, can be transmitted: how to control rage; how to have a conversation; how to be a loving parent; how to be calmer or less inclined to bitterness.\n\nNevertheless, we at The School of Life are aware of how easily people are turned off by anything that appears too preachy and by a fatal tendency for what is worthy to come across as dull. Our commitment to education makes us profoundly interested in the task of seduction: the need to get and hold people\u2019s attention artfully in a highly individualistic world filled with distractions and demands.\n\nBecause education is so central, The School of Life is ambitious about what learning should be like. It should not only be children who go to school. All adults should see themselves as in need of education pretty much every day. One should never be done with school. One should stay an active student, learning throughout life. In the adult section of schools, there should be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. Schools should be where a whole community gets educated, not just a place for children. Some classes should have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia, the phrase \u2018I\u2019ve finished school\u2019 would sound extremely strange.\n\nWhat follows are the key words and terms that underpin the project of emotional education to which we have given the name: The School of Life.",

What properly indicates addiction is not what someone is addicted to, because we can get addicted to pretty much anything. It is the motives behind a reliance on a certain element \u2013 and, in particular, our attachment to it as a way of avoiding encounters with the contents of our own minds and hearts.\n\nFor most of us, facing up to ourselves is a deeply anxiety- inducing prospect. We are filled with thoughts we don\u2019t want to entertain and feelings we are desperate not to feel. There is an infinite amount that we are angry and sad about that it would take an uncommon degree of courage to face. We experience a host of fantasies and desires that we have a huge incentive to disavow because of the extent to which they violate our self-image and our more normative commitments.\n\nWe should not pride ourselves because we aren\u2019t injecting something into our veins. Almost certainly, we are doing something else to take us away from ourselves. We are checking the news at four-minute intervals to keep the news from ourselves at bay. We\u2019re doing sport, exhausting our bodies in the hope of not having to hear from our minds. We\u2019re using work to get away from the true internal work that we\u2019re shirking.\n\nTo overcome addiction, we need to lose our fear of our minds. We need a collective sense of safety around confronting loss, humiliation, sexual desire and sadness.\n\nOn the other side of addiction is philosophy \u2013 understood as the patient, unfrightened, compassionate examination of the contents of our minds.\n\nSee also: Faulty Walnut, The; Monasteries; News from Within; Overeating; Philosophical Meditation; Unprocessed Emotion.",

Their emotional pull is based on their wise understanding that we are creatures who hunger not so much for material goods as for sexual love, good family relationships, connections with others and the feeling that we are respected. Advertisers build their most compelling campaigns by tapping into their intimate knowledge of our psyches.\n\nAn advert for a car might not tell us much about the quality of the suspension or the technology that went into the metallic paint because it realises that such things (mostly) don\u2019t touch our souls. Instead it shows us what we really want: a family coping well with the ups and downs of life or a dignified grey-haired man who knows how to greet the challenges of existence with stoic strength. An advert for jewellery will mainly be about a couple who are still close after ten years of marriage; a chocolate bar or a cashmere jumper might be brought to our notice by means of a touching evocation of friendship.\n\nThis approach can look cynical, but there is a touch of tragedy in the situation \u2013 the tragedy that our manufacturers lag so far behind our advertisers. These manufacturers know how to make rather good car suspensions and can produce utterly reliable timepieces; the jumpers may be elegant and the chocolate delicious. However, none of these manufacturers make much headway in delivering the things we really would love to be getting: the good family life, the self-belief, the warm marriage and the better friendships that currently painfully elude us and whose exquisite portrayal cleverly tricked us (perhaps) into buying a sedan or a barbecue set.\n\nIn a stern mood, we might think that, in an ideal society, advertisers would be banned from hinting that the right bag or oven-ready meal could help us to find love and companionship. But the real solution goes in a different direction. We should want manufacturers and businesses to become much more ambitious about solving our real problems and to generate products that might actually help us with our big, underlying longings.\n\nIn most adverts, the pains and the hopes of our lives have been superbly identified, but the products on the shelves remain almost comically at odds with our real needs. The task is not to ban advertisements but to create an economy that lives up to their deepest promises.\n\nSee also: Glamour; Good Business; Good Demand; Higher Needs; Utopia.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Akrasia\n\nA central problem of our minds is that we know so much in theory about how we should behave, but engage so little with our knowledge in our day-to-day conduct.\n\nWe know in theory about not eating too much, being kind, getting to bed early, focusing on our opportunities before it is too late, showing charity and remembering to be grateful. Yet in practice, our wise ideas have a notoriously weak ability to motivate our actual behaviour. Our knowledge is embedded within us and yet is ineffective for us.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks were unusually alert to this phenomenon and gave it a helpfully resonant name: akrasia, commonly translated as \u2018weakness of will\u2019. It is because of akrasia, they proposed, that we have such a tragic proclivity for knowing what to do but not acting upon our own best principles.\n\nThere are two central solutions to akrasia, located in two unexpected quarters: art and ritual. The real purpose of art (which includes novels, films and songs as well as photos, paintings and works of design and architecture) is to give sensuous and emotional lustre to a range of ideas that are most important to us, but that are also most under threat in the conditions of everyday life. Art shouldn\u2019t be a matter of introducing us to, or challenging us with, a stream of new ideas so much as about lending the good ideas we already have compelling forms \u2013 so that they can more readily weigh upon our behaviour. A euphoric song should activate the reserves of tenderness and sympathy in which we already believe in theory; a novel should move us to the forgiveness in which we are already invested at an intellectual level. Art should help us to feel and then act upon the truths we already know.\n\nRitual is the second defence we have against akrasia. By ritual, we mean the structured, often highly seductive or aesthetic, repetition of a thought or an action, with a view to making it at once convincing and habitual. Ritual rejects the notion that it can ever be sufficient to teach anything important once \u2013 an optimistic delusion by which the modern education system has been fatefully marked. Once might be enough to get us to admit an idea is right, but is nothing like enough to convince us it should be acted upon. Our brains are leaky, and, under pressure of any kind, readily revert to customary patterns of thought and feeling. Ritual trains our cognitive muscles; it makes a sequence of appointments in our diaries to refresh our acquaintance with our most important ideas.\n\nOur current culture tends to see ritual mainly as an antiquated infringement of individual freedom; a bossy command to turn our thoughts in particular directions at specific times. But the defenders of ritual would see it another way: we aren\u2019t being told to think of something we don\u2019t agree with; we are being returned with grace to what we always believed in at heart. We are being tugged by a collective force back to a more loyal and authentic version of ourselves.\n\nThe greatest human institutions that have tried to address the problem of akrasia have been religions. Religions have wanted to do something much more serious than simply promote abstract ideas: they have wanted to get people to behave in line with those ideas, which is a very different thing. They didn\u2019t just want people to think that kindness or forgiveness were nice (which we generally do already); they wanted us to be kind or forgiving most days of the year. They invented a host of ingenious mechanisms for mobilising the will, which is why, across much of the world, the finest art and buildings, the most seductive music, the most impressive and moving rituals have all been religious. Religion is a vast machine for addressing the problem of akrasia.\n\nThis has presented a conundrum for a more secular era. Bad secularisation has lumped together religious superstition and religion\u2019s anti-akrasia strategies. It has rejected both the supernatural ideas of the faiths and their wise attitude to the motivational roles of art and ritual.\n\nA more discerning form of secularisation makes a major distinction between (on the one hand) religion as a set of speculative claims about God and the afterlife and (on the other hand) the always valid ambition to improve our social and psychological lives by combating our notoriously weak wills.\n\nThe challenge for the secular world is now to redevelop its own versions of purposeful art and ritual so that we will cease so regularly to ignore our real commitments and might henceforth not only believe wise things but also, on a day-today basis, have a slightly higher chance of enacting wisdom in our lives.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Art and News; Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Censorship; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Envy of the Future; Memento Mori; Pop Music; Ritual; Secularisation; Seduction; Sublime, The; Wisdom.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Androcles and the Lion\n\nA traditional fable tells of a lion prowling villages at night, roaring horribly. Everyone is terrified, so they want to kill the beast to feel a bit safer. One day, in the nearby hills, a shepherd gets caught in a sudden storm and seeks shelter in a cave \u2013 where the lion has made his home. The terrified shepherd called Androcles imagines he\u2019s about to be ripped to pieces. Then he notices there\u2019s a thorn in the lion\u2019s paw: the creature is in agony and his terrible roars are his way of trying to express his pain. The shepherd takes a risk: he goes up and removes the thorn. The lion stops roaring, becomes gentle, licks the shepherd\u2019s hand and they become friends.\n\nIn the fable, the \u2018lion\u2019 represents someone who frightens us. We assume they are determined to destroy us. But the story suggests an alternative explanation: the frightening person is suffering (psychologically rather than physically). It is their pain that drives them to behave in ways that distress and scare us. If we can be brave enough to notice, acknowledge and in some very tender manner address their suffering, we start to take away the cause of their aggression.\n\nThe French philosopher \u00c9mile-Auguste Chartier (known as Alain) was said to be the finest teacher in France in the first half of the 20th century. He developed a formula for calming down himself and his pupils in the face of irritating people. \u2018Never say that people are evil,\u2019 he wrote; \u2018You just need to look for the pin.\u2019\n\nWhat he meant was: look for the source of the agony that drives a person to behave in appalling ways. The calming thought is to imagine that they are suffering off-stage, in some area we cannot see. To be mature is to learn to imagine this zone of pain, despite the lack of available evidence. They may not look as if they were maddened by an inner psychological ailment: they may look aggressive or full of themselves. But the \u2018pin\u2019 simply must be there \u2013 or they would not be causing us harm.\n\nSee also: Charity of Interpretation; Nastiness; Other-as-Child.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Anger\n\nWe start to reduce the danger of anger through the insight that not everything that makes us sad makes us angry. We may be irritated that it is raining, but we are unlikely ever to respond to a shower by screaming. We aren\u2019t overwhelmed by anger whenever we are frustrated; we are sent into a rage only when we first allowed ourselves to believe in a hopeful scenario that was then dashed suddenly and apparently without warning. Our greatest furies spring from unfortunate events that we had not factored into our vision of reality.\n\nWe typically think of anger as a dark and pessimistic state of mind. But behind anger lies a surprising emotion: optimism. Beneath their ranting, the angry are possessed of some recklessly optimistic notions of how life might go. They are not merely in a destructive fury; they are in the grip of hope.\n\nThe person who shouts every time they encounter a traffic jam betrays a faith, at once touching and demented, that roads must always be traffic-free. The person who loses their temper with every new employee or partner evinces a curious belief that perfection is an option for the human animal.\n\nSerenity therefore begins with pessimism. We must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before the world ever has a chance to slap us by surprise at a time of its own choosing. The angry must learn to check their fury via a systematic, patient surrender of their more fervent hopes. They need to be carefully inducted into the darkest realities of life, to the stupidities of others, to the ineluctable failings of technology, to the necessary flaws of infrastructure. They should start each day with a short yet thorough premeditation on the many humiliations and insults to which the coming hours risk subjecting them.\n\nOne of the goals of civilisation is to instruct us in how to be sad rather than angry. Sadness may not sound very appealing, but in this context it carries a huge advantage. It allows us to detach our emotional energies from fruitless fury around things that (however bad) we cannot change and that are the fault of no-one in particular and \u2013 after a period of mourning \u2013 to refocus our efforts in places where our few remaining hopes and expectations have a realistic chance of success.\n\nSee also: Pessimism; Premeditation; Resilience.",

It\u2019s been a tricky day: a threatened resignation, an enraged supplier, a lost document, two delayed trains \u2026 But none of the mayhem is of any concern to one friend waiting by the door, uncomplicatedly pleased to see us: Pippi, a two-year-old border terrier with an appetite for catching a deflated football in her jaws. She wants to play in the usual way, even if it\u2019s past nine o\u2019clock now, with us in the chair and her sliding around the kitchen, and, unexpectedly, so do we. We\u2019re not offended by her lack of overall interest in us; it\u2019s at the root of our delight. Here, at last, is someone indifferent to almost everything about us except for our dexterity at ball-throwing; someone who doesn\u2019t care about the Brussels meeting, who will forgive us for not warning the finance department in time about the tax rebates and for whom the Lisbon conference is beyond imagining.\n\nOne of the most consoling aspects of animals \u2013 whether a dog, sheep, lizard or beetle \u2013 is that their priorities have nothing to do with our own perilous and tortured agendas. They are redemptively unconcerned with everything we are and want. They implicitly mock our self-importance and absorption and so return us to a fairer, more modest, sense of our role on the planet.\n\nA sheep doesn\u2019t know about our feelings of jealousy; it has no interest in our humiliation and bitterness around a colleague; it has never sent an email. On a walk in the hills, it simply ambles towards the path we\u2019re on and looks curiously at us, then takes a lazy mouthful of grass, chewing from the side of its mouth as though it were gum. One of its companions approaches and sits next to it, wool to wool; for a second, they exchange what appears to be a knowing, mildly amused, glance.\n\nDucks nibble at the weeds, waddle down to the water and paddle about in circles without any interest in which century it happens to be from a human point of view; they\u2019ve never heard of the economy; they don\u2019t know what country they live in; they don\u2019t have new ideas or regret what happened yesterday. They don\u2019t care about the career hurdles or relationship status of the person who sprinkles a few breadcrumbs near them.\n\nTime around animals invites us into a world in which most of the things that obsess us have no significance. It corrects our characteristic over-investment in matters that make only a limited contribution to the essential task of existence: to be kind, to make the most of our talents, to love and to appreciate.\n\nSee also: Nature; Sublime, The",

It is mostly a reasonable and sensitive response to the genuine strangeness, terror, uncertainty and riskiness of existence.\n\nAnxiety is our fundamental state for well-founded reasons: because we are intensely vulnerable physical beings, a complicated network of fragile organs all biding their time before letting us down catastrophically at a moment of their own choosing. Because we have insufficient information upon which to make most major life decisions. Because we can imagine so much more than we have, and live in ambitious mediatised societies where envy and restlessness are constant. Because we are the descendants of the great worriers of the species, the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals, and because we still carry in our DNA \u2013 into the calm of the suburbs \u2013 the terrors of the savannah. Because the progress of our careers and of our finances plays out within the tough-minded, competitive, destructive, random workings of an uncontained economic engine. Because we rely for our self-esteem and sense of comfort on the love of people we cannot control and whose needs and hopes will never align seamlessly with our own.\n\nAll of which is not to say that there aren\u2019t better and worse ways to approach our condition. The single most important move is acceptance. There is no need to be anxious that we are anxious on top of everything else. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong; merely that we are alive. We should also be more careful when pursuing things we imagine will spare us anxiety. We can head to them by all means, but for other reasons than fantasies of calm \u2013 and with a little less vigour and a little more scepticism. We will still be anxious when we finally have the house, the love affair and the right income.\n\nWe should spare ourselves the burden of loneliness. We are far from the only ones with this problem. Everyone is more anxious than they are inclined to tell us. Even the tycoon and the couple in love are suffering. We have collectively failed to admit to ourselves how much we panic.\n\nWe must learn to laugh about our anxieties \u2013 laughter being the exuberant expression of relief when a hitherto private agony is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke. We must suffer alone. But we can at least hold out our arms to our similarly tortured, fractured, and above all else, anxious neighbours, as if to say, in the kindest way possible: \u2018I know\u2026\u2019\n\nAnxiety deserves greater dignity. It is not a sign of degeneracy. It is a kind of masterpiece of insight: a justifiable expression of our mysterious participation in a disordered, uncertain world.\n\nSee also: Normality; Pessimism.",

We get unduly cross that they are eight minutes late; we chastise them for not having done certain chores; we ask them strictly if they\u2019ve completed a task they had only vaguely agreed to undertake.

As a final recourse, we may ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about their extensive practical shortcomings. Anything rather than ask the question that disturbs us so much: does this person love me?

With enormous skill, it throws into relief the very best sides of particular places and objects. It uses wordsmiths and image-makers of near-genius, who create deeply inspiring and beguiling associations \u2013 and it positions works close to our eyelines at most moments of the day.\n\nAdvertising is the most compelling agent of mass appreciation the world has ever known. It hones our sensitivity to the elegant styling of a car bonnet or to the niceties of design around training shoes; we become acutely receptive to the personalities of handbags or sunglasses. Because advertising is ubiquitous, it can be easy to forget that only a limited range of things ever get advertised; only a limited range of products can support the budgets for prominent advertising campaigns.\n\nChristen K\u00f8bke, Morning Light, 1836.\n\nThis Danish artist brought touching awareness to an often-underappreciated subject: cloudy skies.\n\nOne of the tasks of art is to teach us appreciation of many other important things. In the 1830s, the Danish artist Christen K\u00f8bke did a lot of advertising for the sky, especially just before or after a rain shower.\n\nHis \u2018product\u2019 was, in effect, rain clouds, whose market share of love he felt was disappointing, like a delicious biscuit that hadn\u2019t yet found its market. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t trying to get us to buy a cloud. But, just like an advertiser, he wanted us to be much more sensitive than we normally are to the charms of grey skies; how they go so nicely with small patches of sunlight; how they enhance a quiet moment in a busy day; how they can make the ordinary feel special. Under his guidance, we are sensitised to different kinds of cloud: some are attractively independent, some fluffy and light, others massy and assertive.\n\nOther works of art might advertise kindness or melancholy; the loveliness of trees or night-time walks; going to bed early, or making a heartfelt apology.\n\nArt is advertising for the things that really matter, but that aren\u2019t usually for sale.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Kintsugi; Rock Appreciation; Ugliness; Water Towers.",

Some buildings, streets and even whole cities seem to speak of chaos, aggression or military pride; others seem to whisper to us of calm or graceful dignity, generosity or gentleness.\n\nHowever, a dominant strand of modern opinion doesn\u2019t think it matters much what our buildings speak to us about. It is deemed pretentious or over-sensitive to suppose that something as external as a building could have much effect on our mood. We\u2019d rather see ourselves as able to generate our psychological states independently of the colour, shape and texture of walls.\n\nAnd yet a more modest, permeable idea of who we are would accept with good grace that we remain vulnerable to the voices of the largest, most public objects in our environment. Our inner states are open to influence and we may be as harmed by architectural ugliness as we are by moral evil. Our spirits can be decisively sunk by a grid of city streets designed without any talent or care.\n\nIn modern commercial society, buildings are seen largely in terms of finance, cost and return on capital. Politicians impose some restraints on developers. There are frequently a few rules about height and environmental performance. But the full range of the kinds of damage that ugly buildings create for us has not been recognised or granted political expression. There is nothing unusual in this. Many forms of public harm can be real yet ignored; it took many decades for the pollution of rivers to be interpreted as a real threat to the public good.\n\nIf we better understood the impact that ugly architecture has on our lives, its power to sap our spirits and assist our worst selves, we would surely legislate against it. But as yet, no politician who announced an intention to make the built environment more beautiful would prosper \u2013 or even be deemed sane.\n\nIn the Utopia, architecture would more fairly be interpreted as a branch of mental health, with a crucial role to play in public contentment. And bad design would be interpreted as a crime to the health of the collective spirit.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Fashion; Home; Monasteries.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Art, The Purpose of\n\nThe idea that art might not have a purpose is a relatively new one, emerging only in France in the middle of the 19th century. For the rest of history, in every established civilisation, it has seemed obvious that art has certain specific and important tasks to perform.\n\nTo summarise the objectives, the role of art has been: to give us a more accurate picture of the inner lives of other people; to show us what \u2018normal\u2019 really means and thus assuage our loneliness and shyness; to embolden the confession of our vulnerabilities by giving us greater confidence that others will understand; to console us in our sorrows; to draw our attention to pleasures we might otherwise overlook; to make important but not initially alluring ideas seductive and glamorous, so that we can more easily embrace them; to enlarge our sympathies for people who are not outwardly successful \u2013 not by making us feel guilty but by showing us what is genuinely admirable and attractive about them; and to take an ice pick to the frozen surface of our being and reconnect us with the deeper emotions on which our friendships, relationships and ambitions depend.\n\nThe key thing about art was identified by the Ancient Roman poet Horace: poetry (and art in general) should both \u2018delight and instruct\u2019. The combination is vital: there is so much in which we need to be instructed, but we will not learn unless we are delighted. The essential task of artists is to find the way to get round our boredom and our defences and entice us to pay serious attention to those ideas we need to keep at the front of our minds in order to live and die well.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Appreciation; Architecture; Art and News; Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Artistic Rebalancing; Artistic Sympathy; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Inner Voices; Memento Mori; Music; Normality; Rock Appreciation; Sane Insanity; Seduction; Water Towers.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Art and News\n\nNews organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information \u2013 assuming that if the information is significant, it will immediately go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We too often get bored and turn away when the facts, however important they might be, are heaped in front of us in a dry or confrontational way. In order to matter to us, facts have to be shaped so that they can enter our imaginations. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.\n\nA standard response on the part of frustrated news organisations is to blame us, the audience, for not caring enough. The reason we don\u2019t care about important things must be that we\u2019re stupid or selfish. The inclination is then to nag, to make us feel guilty for, and ashamed of, our indifference. This approach might work for a small number of people, but is usually ineffective. We simply stop listening. We just don\u2019t care about yet another victim, refugee or instance of tyranny.\n\nBut another, kinder and more realistic, way of thinking about our indifference is to see it as the consequence of a failure of art. There is no such thing as a boring story, only a story told in a boring way. Pretty much any sequence of events could be made compelling in the hands of a talented artist.\n\nAn instance of the power of art in relation to the news can be found in a strange historical episode. During the 1820s, the British public became obsessed with the Greek War of Independence, during which Greece broke away from the Ottoman Empire after Britain offered decisive material assistance to the rebels. This was surprising because there was no obvious interest for Britain in the move. The reason for the involvement was more or less entirely due to the impassioned support and advocacy of the most famous writer of the era: the poet Lord Byron. In one poem he wrote:\n\nThe mountains look on Marathon \u2013\n\nAnd Marathon looks on the sea;\n\nAnd musing there an hour alone,\n\nI dreamed that Greece might still be free.\n\nByron didn\u2019t pile up statistics or argue a complex political case. He didn\u2019t scold. He painted an emotional picture. The entire educated population of England knew of the ancient battle of Marathon and of the famous run that brought news of victory to Athens. Byron was conveying a sense of the grandeur of the current struggle and making people in Hampshire and Sussex feel that events unfolding in the Peloponnese mattered to them as much as something in their own village. Byron was not above a few salacious and sentimental moves: he wrote of how attractive Greek women were and lamented that, unless the War of Independence was won, \u2018such breasts must suckle slaves\u2019.\n\nArt seduces: it can be defined as the skill of making an idea immediately powerful via an appeal to the senses. This isn\u2019t a climbdown; it is a wise recognition of how our minds function. The newsrooms of the Utopia would be largely staffed by artists, so that the most important messages could be made to lodge properly and powerfully in our erratic and distracted minds.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Art, The Purpose of; Changing the World; News; Seduction",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Art for Art\u2019s Sake\n\nIn answer to the question of what art might be for, the established reply is to point out rather scornfully that it isn\u2019t for anything. As a famous saying goes, art is for art\u2019s sake.\n\nThe expression dates back to mid-19th-century France, an era of nascent industrialisation and scientific progress that grew highly concerned with the notion of \u2018usefulness\u2019. Those who wished to attack art and its values asked what it really ever achieved, and therefore whether it still deserved the respect it had traditionally enjoyed. Could a painting build a railway? Could a poem bake bread? Might a sculpture transport one across an ocean? And given that they obviously couldn\u2019t, was this not proof of the underlying pretension and superfluity of art?\n\nIn reaction to such assaults, the artistic community grew brittle and defiant; it embraced the intended criticism but turned it into a point of pride: art, it said, is too lofty and important to be merely useful. Its glory must lie somewhere else, in being above petty concerns, in its sheer wondrous uselessness. The more the world grew shrill in its questioning and materialistic in its values, the more artists turned away angrily and defensively from the very idea of purpose.\n\nIn cultural circles, it became taboo to wonder too loudly what a given poem or painting might be for. To ask what good might come of a certain piece of music or a play was taken as a sign of unforgivable Philistinism. Art became a cult of inutility, apparently best loved and most accomplished when it was ethereally devoid of purpose.\n\nBut this was a tragic misunderstanding of what artists can do for us. Baking bread, building railways or crossing oceans cover only a fraction of what deserves to be counted as useful. To lead good lives, we need not merely lightbulbs and telephone lines, chemicals and stock exchanges; we also need to be consoled in our griefs, guided towards wisdom, opened up to self-knowledge, calmed in our anxieties, given new hope and introduced to wider horizons \u2013 all tasks for which the practical tool known as art is eminently suited. Only under a desperately narrow vision of usefulness could art ever be dismissed as useless.\n\nUnfortunately, though, the notion of art for art\u2019s sake has maintained a powerful presence in modern culture \u2013 especially in the artist community itself. In the top universities, among leading cultural critics, in the great museums, it remains taboo to speak of purpose, or to ask that art should help us with our confusions, melancholy and loneliness.\n\nTo do justice to art, we should recover the traditional, pre-19th-century assessment of its role: the sense that it is an overwhelmingly practical medium designed to help us live and die well. Art is there to guide, console, provide balance and perspective, to calm and reassure us, to offer us more accurate ideas about the inner lives of others and to present important concepts in seductive and sensuous clothing, in order to combat our forgetfulness and coldness of heart.\n\nThe phrase \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019 was born to defend art from unfair attack, but it ended up fatefully weakening it, blinding us to its real role in society. The salvation of art does not lie in thinking of it as useless, we can now see, but in remembering and rehearsing the very serious reasons for its overwhelming utility within the span of every good life.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Art, The Purpose of; Artistic Rebalancing; Philosophy; Self-Help Books; Tragedy.",

But around certain works of art we\u2019re invited to a very different view of darkness. These art works remember how much of life deserves solemn and mournful states.

They do so via a more sombre but effective route: they show us that we are not alone in our griefs.\n\nStanding as a record of the tears of humanity, art lends legitimacy to despair and replays our miseries back to us with dignity, shorn of many of their haphazard or trivial particulars. \u2018A book [though the same could be said of any art form] must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us,\u2019 proposed Kafka; in other words, an art work is a tool to help release us from our numbness, to allow us to shed tears and to provide occasions for catharsis in areas where we have for too long been damagingly brave.\n\nSee also: Consolation; Eudaimonia; Jolliness.",

A portion of the surplus wealth created in one area (oil, supermarkets, construction, the media) is deposited in another: public art galleries. The paintings and sculpture on display often murmur quietly about the deepest and loveliest things: compassion for the secret sorrows of existence, the splendour of nature, harmony, the honour of sacrifice, the strange glory of a sunflower, the sweet moodiness of dusk. The hope is that, by a circuitous route, these values will become \u2013 even if only a little \u2013 more powerful in reality. In the ideal scenario, they will radiate out from the gallery and shape the way we lead our lives.\n\nYet the money that paid for them may have been accumulated under a very different vision of life: workers were paid the least possible amounts; only the responsibilities enforced by law were embraced; governments were lobbied to reduce consumer and environmental protection; quality was reduced as low as the market would allow; debts were paid slowly but creditors were hounded. Oddly, in their business, the artistic philanthropist had the opportunity to make real \u2013 on a large scale \u2013 the qualities they subsequently sought to honour in their gifts. Yet very often they did not.\n\nIt would be better to repatriate the ambition and for the capitalists to be themselves the agents of the virtues they admire in the arts. The cost (in terms of cash) might be approximately the same. Their businesses might be a little less profitable year by year and they might not feel they had enough left over to lavish on the arts. But it would be no loss, for instead of hanging reticently on a wall, those values so ably captured in art \u2013 of friendship, love, wisdom and beauty \u2013 would be enacted day to day in the boardroom and the canteen, the distribution centre and the factory \u2013 in other words, in the vastly more consequential realm of commerce itself.\n\nSee also: Good Business.",

Our psychological histories, relationships and working routines mean that many of our emotions incline a little too much in one direction or another.\n\nFortunately, this is an issue that culture is well placed to help us with, for works of art can put us powerfully in touch with concentrated doses of our missing dispositions, and thereby restore a measure of equilibrium to our listing inner selves.\n\nImagine that we have fallen into a way of life that suffers from too much intensity, stimulation and distraction. Work is frantic across three continents. The inbox is clogged with two hundred messages every hour. There is hardly time to reflect on anything once the day starts. This explains why we might be powerfully drawn to a minimalist interior, where things appear calm, logical and reduced to their essence. This is our true home, from which our way of life has exiled us.\n\nJohn Pawson, The Life House, 2016.\n\nA minimalist interior offers quiet beauty to balance out over-stimulation.\n\nBut because we are not all missing the same things, the kinds of art that have a capacity to rebalance us, and therefore arouse enthusiasm in us, will differ markedly. Imagine we happen to be a bureaucrat in one of the sleepier branches of the Norwegian civil service based in the idyllic though rather quiet town of Trondheim near the Arctic Circle. Our days run like clockwork. We are always home by 5.15pm and do the crossword before bed. The last thing we may be attracted to is a pristinely ordered home by John Pawson. We might be drawn instead to Flamenco music, the paintings of Frida Kahlo and the architecture of Mexico\u2019s Catedral de Santa Prisca \u2013 varieties of art to restore life to our slumbering souls.\n\nFa\u00e7ade of the Catedral de Santa Prisca y San Sebastian, Taxco, Mexico, constructed 1751\u20131758.\n\nArt to rebalance an over-quiet soul.\n\nEdmund Blair Leighton, The End of the Song, 1902.\n\nArt to rebalance oneself after too many railways, factories and readings of Darwin.\n\nJacques-Louis David, The Oath of the Horatii, 1784.\n\nArt to rebalance oneself after overindulgence in mistresses, gold and parties.\n\nWhole nations can manifest longings for balance and will use art to help them achieve it. After too much aristocratic decadence, many in late 18th-century France felt the need to get back in touch with marshal solemnity and spartan simplicity and so found refuge in the pared-down works of Jacques-Louis David.\n\nBy the later part of the 19th century in England, the materialism, scientific obsession and capitalist rationality of the age drove many to long for more faithful, mystical days, and so to locate \u2018beauty\u2019 in the images inspired by the literature and history of the Middle Ages.\n\nWhat we call \u2018beautiful\u2019 is any work of art that supplies a missing dose of a much-needed psychological component, and we dismiss as \u2018ugly\u2019 one that forces on us moods or motifs by which we feel threatened or are already overwhelmed. Our contact with art holds out the promise of inner wholeness.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Music.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Artistic Sympathy\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of our world is that it contains such enormous disparities in income. At various times, there have been concerted attempts to correct the injustice. Inspired by Marxism, Communist governments forcibly seized private wealth and Socialist governments have repeatedly tried imposing punitive taxes on rich companies and individuals. There have also been attempts to reform the education system, to create positive discrimination in the workplace and to seize the estates of the wealthiest members of society at their deaths.\n\nBut the problem of inequality has not gone away, and is unlikely to be solved at any point soon, let alone in the short timeframe that is relevant to any of us, for a range of stubbornly embedded, partly logical, partly absurd reasons.\n\nHowever, there is one important move we can make that could reduce some of the sting of inequality. For this, we need to begin by asking what might sound like an offensively obvious question: why is financial inequality a problem?\n\nThere are two very different answers. One kind of harm is material: not being able to get a decent house, quality health-care, a proper education and a hopeful future for one\u2019s children. But there is also a psychological reason why inequality proves so problematic: because poverty is intricately bound up with humiliation and lack of respect. The punishment of poverty is not limited to money; it extends to the suffering that attends a lack of status, a constant low-level sense that who one is and what one does is of no interest to a world that is punitively unequal in its distribution of honour as well as cash. Poverty not only induces financial harm, but also damages mental health as well.\n\nHistorically, the bulk of political effort has been directed at the first material problem, yet there is also an important move we can make around the psychological issue.\n\nThe sketch of the solution to the gap between income and respect lies in a slightly unexpected place: hanging in a top-floor gallery of London\u2019s Wallace Collection in Manchester Square is a small painting called The Lacemaker, by the little-known German artist Caspar Netscher, who painted it in 1662.\n\nThe artist has caught the woman making lace at a moment of intense concentration on a difficult task. We can feel the effort she is making and can imagine the skill and intelligence she is devoting to her work. At the time the painting was created, lace was highly prized. But because many people knew how to make it, the economic law of supply and demand meant that the reward for exquisite craftsmanship was tiny. Lacemakers were among the poorest in society. Were the artist working today, his portrait would have been equivalent to making a short film about office cleaners or fruit pickers. It would have been evident to all the painting\u2019s viewers that the lacemaker was someone who ordinarily had no respect at all; this was a vision of the lowest of the low.\n\nCaspar Netscher, The Lacemaker, 1662.\n\nThis beautiful painting lends grace and dignity to the otherwise humble lacemaker.\n\nHowever, Netscher directed an extraordinary amount of what one might call artistic sympathy towards his sitter. Through his eyes and artistry, she is no longer a nobody. She has grown into an individual, full of her own thoughts, sensitive, serious, complicated, devoted; entirely deserving of tenderness and consideration. The artist has transformed how we might look at a lacemaker.\n\nNetscher isn\u2019t sternly saying that we should have respect for the low-paid; we hear this often enough and the lesson rarely sinks in. He is not trying to use guilt, which is rarely an effective tactic. He\u2019s getting us to feel respect for his worker rather than just know it might be her due. His picture isn\u2019t nagging, grim or forbidding; it is a seductive, delightful mechanism for teaching us a very unfamiliar but critically important supra-political emotion.\n\nIf lots of people saw the lacemaker in the way the artist did, took the lesson properly to heart and applied it widely and imaginatively at every moment of their lives, it is no exaggeration to say that the psychological burden of poverty would be lifted substantially. The fate of lacemakers, but also warehouse attendants, delivery workers, labourers and those presently dehumanised under the vast category we know as \u2018immigrants\u2019 would be significantly improved. Greater sympathy would not be a replacement for political action; it would be its precondition \u2013 the sentiment upon which a material change in the lives of the victims of inequality would be founded.\n\nAn artist like Netscher isn\u2019t changing how much the low-paid earn; he is changing how the low-paid are judged. This is not an unimportant piece of progress. Netscher was living in an age in which only a very few people might ever see a picture \u2013 and of course he was concentrating only on the then current face of poverty. But the process he undertook remains profoundly relevant.\n\nIdeally today, our culture would pursue the very same project but on a vastly enlarged scale, enticing us via our most successful, popular and widespread art forms to a grand political revolution in feeling, upon which an eventual, firmly based revolution in economic distribution would arise.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Nagging; Suicide; Tragedy; Universal Love.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Bad Taste\n\nIn matters of design and decoration, it has grown taboo to accuse anyone of having \u2018bad taste\u2019. The official story is that no one knows what good or bad taste might be and that every taste must be of equal validity.\n\nYet this appears both untrue to experience and lacking in ambition. To make progress, we should begin by considering the psychological mechanisms that govern the business of taste. We need to consider the theory of artistic rebalancing. We are all somewhat unbalanced inside and grow attracted to artistic styles that promise to compensate us for, or \u2018correct\u2019, the things we lack within. This explains why people who feel chaotic, undisciplined and cluttered inside are liable to be drawn to interiors that are serene, pure and poised. Equally, people who are exposed to, and oppressed by, the hurried tempo of modern life are often drawn to styles that speak of the rustic and the natural.\n\nWhat singles out \u2018bad taste\u2019 is merely that the desire for compensation has grown particularly acute because the deprivation has been correspondingly intense. Those who have experienced crushing poverty will, if the opportunity arises, often adopt a gaudy style derived from the most gilded aspects of the palace of Versailles. Those whose lives are excessively harsh may favour garden gnomes, enormous and brightly coloured stuffed toys and sentimental trinkets.\n\nIn every instance of bad taste, we find an over-eager embracing of a good quality \u2013 sweetness, freedom, fun or prosperity \u2013 that is, or once was, in very short supply in the owner\u2019s life. Bad taste can appal, but once one understands its origins, sympathy is a more appropriate response.\n\nWhat is \u2018bad\u2019 in bad taste is not the person, but the prior difficulty for which they are seeking to compensate through their d\u00e9cor. There is no point in mocking or offering lectures about art history. The problem isn\u2019t a lack of information. It is a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world. Therefore, the solution to bad taste is, in the broad sense, political. Good taste comes about when people feel appreciated, when there\u2019s enough to go around and when there\u2019s an economy that doesn\u2019t routinely humiliate and abase its members. To make good taste more widespread, what matters above all are efforts to diminish the desperate lives in which lapses of taste invariably have their origins.\n\nSee also: Artistic Rebalancing; Charity of Interpretation; Universal Love.",

They don\u2019t pose immediate problems; they keep their bedroom tidy, do their homework on time and are willing to help with the washing up. But the very real secret sorrows \u2013 and future difficulties \u2013 of the good child are tied to the fact that they behave in this way not out of choice, but because they feel under irresistible pressure to do so. They are trying to cope with adults who project the idea that only the ideally compliant child is truly loveable.\n\nAs a result, the good child becomes an expert at pleasing their audience, while their real thoughts and feelings stay buried. Eventually, under pressure, these good children may manifest some disturbing symptoms: secret sulphurous bitterness, sudden outbursts of rage and very harsh views of their own imperfections.\n\nThe good person typically has particular problems around sex. As a child, they may have been praised for being pure and innocent. As an adult the most exciting parts of their own sexuality strike them as perverse, disgusting and deeply at odds with who they are meant to be. As an adult, the good child is likely to have problems at work as well. They feel too strong a need to follow the rules, never make trouble or annoy anyone. But almost everything that is interesting or worth doing will meet with a degree of opposition and will seriously irritate some people. The good child is condemned to career mediocrity and sterile people-pleasing.\n\nThe desire to be good is one of the loveliest things in the world, but in order to have a genuinely good life, we may sometimes need to be (by the standards of the good child) fruitfully and bravely bad.\n\nSee also: Duty Trap, The; Love as Generosity; Splitting and Integration.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Better Porn\n\nThe idea of good porn can seem paradoxical. Many of us are used to thinking of all porn as \u2018bad\u2019. Yet when people eat badly, we don\u2019t try to stop them eating at all. We hope to improve their diet. The aim isn\u2019t to abolish food just because some food is terrible. We want good food to be more widely and easily available. The same move could apply to online sex sites. We can\u2019t abolish porn, so the goal is to get good pornography.\n\nBetter porn isn\u2019t even more thrilling or exciting. It is \u2018better\u2019 in the sense of being less at odds with the rest of our lives. It isn\u2019t merely about sex, but also about other things we care about, like self-understanding, kindness, intelligence and good relationships. Unfortunately, we have left porn largely in the hands of people who don\u2019t seem to be interested in anything much apart from sex. Better porn would reconnect sexuality with other parts of our lives.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be negative about porn just because of how most of it seems today. In 1800, many people offering medical services were quacks. They didn\u2019t know what they were doing. There was a hunger for remedies, however misguided. So \u2018being a doctor\u2019 was nothing like the respectable career choice it is today. What changed was the realisation that we needed really serious, thoughtful and honourable people to go into the medical field. Health was too important to be left to self-appointed peddlers of fanciful potions.\n\nWe are hugely aware of the things that can go wrong around porn in the internet age. But the longing for sexual stimulation isn\u2019t going to go away. Given how vast the demand is, and how crucial the role of sexuality is in life, it is tragic that comparatively so little talent, wisdom, intelligence, maturity and aesthetic imagination has been directed to it. We\u2019ve rightly come to fear bad porn because it damages so many lives. Good porn could help us deal a little better with the complex, tricky fact of being at the same time highly sexual and highly reasonable beings.\n\n(The School of Life has developed its own porn site, available at: www.pornastherapy.com).\n\nSee also: Sexual Liberation.",

But around work, we can sometimes have a radically different kind of experience: we get on top of a problem and finally resolve it. We bring order to chaos in a way that we rarely can in other areas of life.\n\nThe Zen Buddhist monks of medieval Japan had an intuitive understanding of this kind of benefit to work. In order to achieve peace of mind, they recommended that members of a monastery regularly rake the gravel of their intricately plotted and bounded temple gardens around Kyoto. Within the confines of a large courtyard space, the monks could bring total coherence and beauty to fruition. It wasn\u2019t completely easy. The monks loved to make ambitious patterns of swirls and circles. The lines were often on a very small scale; they might inadvertently tread on a bit they\u2019d already done; they might struggle to keep the rake going at just the right angle. It was sometimes maddening, especially when it was autumn and there were leaves everywhere. But it could, eventually, all be put right. With time and a bit of careful correction and a well-trained hand, they could get everything just as it should be. The problems were real, but they were bounded \u2013 and they could be solved.\n\nWe are not wrong to love perfection, but it brings us a lot of pain. At its best, our work offers us a patch of gravel that we can rake, a bounded space we can make ideally tidy and via which we can fulfil our powerful inner need for order and control, so often thwarted in a wider world beset by defiant unruliness.\n\nIn a small but real way, through our work, we are clearing and cultivating a tiny portion of a wild surrounding forest and turning it into a harmonious, comprehensible garden.\n\nSee also: Flowers; Quiet Life, The.",

However, they can make it harder for us to recognise a few ways in which certain kinds of censorship may be genuinely helpful to us and align with our best interests.\n\nGood censorship starts from an admission that we suffer from a congenital weakness of the will (akrasia). There is so much we would like to do, eat, say and be, but we are horribly prone to be pulled towards less admirable patterns of behaviour. We give in to passing desires, we are defenceless before certain passions, and we end up acting in ways we profoundly regret. This isn\u2019t a severe judgement about the failings of other people; it\u2019s a frank confession of our own private inadequacies.\n\nGood censorship takes our weaknesses seriously and wants to help us with them. It isn\u2019t about a bossy instinct to clamp down on the rest of society; it\u2019s the realisation that a well-calibrated dose of censorship might be of genuine assistance in our attempts to lead good lives. We may willingly give up the keys to someone else, surrendering to external authority in order to nurture our own best but fragile instincts.\n\nWe might, for example, end up profoundly grateful to live in a society that doesn\u2019t make it too easy to eat the wrong things, to spend our money in fitful ways, to exploit other people through our purchases, to develop addictions, or to aggravate our febrile compulsive sides. It isn\u2019t so much the authorities who might want this for us; it\u2019s we who want it for ourselves. Good censorship limits our freedom to do anything in the name of liberating us to be who we want to become deep down. We may long for a little gently administered censorship to protect our best from our worst selves.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Emotional Scepticism; Faulty Walnut, The; News.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Changing the World\n\nThe world needs to be changed in many urgent ways: the great question is how this change might best occur.\n\nThe Romantic view is that the world is sick because of a lack of good ideas. Therefore, the most prestigious and urgent move might be to withdraw and write a book or start a think tank, and thereby work out what justice is, solutions for climate change, why relationships don\u2019t work, or why there is so much inequality.\n\nImmense prestige has surrounded the gestation of new ideas for helping humanity for the last three hundred years. And yet the world has continued to change a lot less than it should, remaining surprisingly committed to its familiar wicked ways, despite the existence of so many revolutionary and truly wise plans.\n\nThis is perhaps because we have missed an insight. The world is not principally in the state it is because we lack good ideas. We know almost everything we could ever need to know about justice, beauty, wisdom, truth and kindness. Our problem isn\u2019t a deficit of good ideas; it\u2019s a stubborn inability to act upon and correctly implement the many good ideas we already have.\n\nThe world is not held together simply by ideas: it is made up of laws, practices, institutions, financial arrangements, businesses and governments. In other words, improvements cannot be made lasting and effective until legions of people start to work together and begin the unglamorous and boring task of wrestling with tangled issues of law, money, long-term mass communication, advocacy and administration.\n\nIn the single greatest book of philosophy ever written, The Republic, Plato articulated a provocative understanding (gathered from bitter experience) of the limits of intellectuals, when he remarked that the world would never be set right until, in his words, \u2018philosophers become kings, or kings philosophers\u2019. He was advising that thinkers should stop imagining that ideas alone can ever change reality and urging us to recognise that it is only through the command of institutions \u2013 \u2018kingship\u2019, in this context \u2013 that we have any chance of exerting a proper influence on the world.\n\nThe reason why philosophers have found it so hard to become kings very often comes down to issues of temperament. Those with the good ideas have been bad with money; they have grown tetchy around details; they have not liked to campaign or team up; they have had spiky characters; they didn\u2019t like going to the office or sharing a platform. They were wary of popularisation and diffusion: they secretly liked embattled exclusivity. They may even have been rather proud of their inability to read a balance sheet. Such Romantic prejudices have kept the status quo reliably unchanged.\n\nSole authorship and sporadic individual impassioned action cannot be a logical long-term way to address the complexities of the most significant global issues. Changing the world requires patient and impersonal teamwork: it calls out for the collective efforts of entrepreneurs and product managers, accountants and media strategists, lawyers and activists, members of parliament and social workers. Change takes years: it is made up of many very small victories; it involves compromises at every stage, and it is accompanied by countless humiliating reversals.\n\nIt all sounds very un-Romantic \u2013 and that\u2019s the point. The only way to bring about the change we need is to alter our sense of how change really occurs \u2013 away from exclusivity, intellectualism and spontaneity and in the direction of modesty, patience, rigour and collaboration.\n\nSee also: Art and News; Classical; Romantic; Seduction; State Broadcasting.",

Normally this is understood to mean something material; we overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money.\n\nHowever, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about the interpretation of motives. It involves seeing that another person\u2019s bad behaviour is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is a result of suffering.\n\nThe psychologically charitable feel inwardly \u2018fortunate\u2019 enough to be able to come forward with explanations of others\u2019 misdeeds \u2013 their impatience or over-ambition, rashness or rage \u2013 that take attenuating circumstances into account. They generate a picture of who another person might be that can make them seem more than simply mean or mad.\n\nIn financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but they normally stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in our relationships with others more broadly, the need for charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided, for we all stand in need of constant generosity of interpretation. We are never far from requiring help in explaining to the world why we are not as awful as we appear.\n\nSee also: Androcles and the Lion; Bad Taste; Other-as-Child; Universal Love; Weakness of Strength.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Cheerful Despair\n\nOne of philosophy\u2019s most established oppositions, depicted in art throughout the centuries, is between two great Greek thinkers, Democritus and Heraclitus. Both men (who lived to a very old age) had a deep knowledge of people and the world, but responded to what they knew in strikingly different ways. Heraclitus could not stop weeping; Democritus could not stop laughing.\n\nCrucially, Democritus laughed not because a privileged position led him to naively misunderstand how bad things could be. His good humour wasn\u2019t a version of sentimentality or avoidant optimism. Nor was it simply a random quirk of temperament. Democritus laughed in a very particular and admirable way because he had learnt the subtle art of Cheerful Despair.\n\nThe philosopher recommended that we acquaint ourselves with the totality of human experience, with all its failings, follies, self-deception and casual (and not so casual) injustices. The wise person should take care to grow completely at home with the ordinary shambles of existence. They must never be taken by surprise or shocked by how things can be, for they have taken full notice of the facts and so can be embittered by nothing. Betrayal, murder, sexual deviance, corruption \u2013 all are already factored in. The wise understand that they are living on a dunghill. When baseness and malice rear their heads, as they will, it is against a backdrop of fully vanquished hope, so there will be no sense of having been unfairly let down and one\u2019s credulity betrayed. Democritus was so convinced of the darkness, he no longer had to register it constantly at the front of his mind in order to do it justice. It seemed an entirely obvious, baseline fact about existence.\n\nThe laughing Greek could be cheerful, because anything nice, sweet or charming that came his way was immediately experienced as a bonus; a deeply gratifying addition to his original bleak premises. By keeping the dark backdrop of life always in mind, he sharpened his appreciation of whatever stood out against it. He did not have to be on constant high alert for the negative; he had the inner space to listen out for the faintest signals of redemption. The positive was not a feeble echo of dashed hopes; it was a particularly delightful, slightly improbable but noteworthy bucking of the usual and expected tragic trend.\n\nDemocritus was known to be fond of parties. He enjoyed wine and drinking. \u2018A life without festivity is a long road without an inn\u2019, he wrote. His occasional frivolities weren\u2019t a rejection of his more serious insights and tasks; they were what kept up his spirits so that he could continue to engage with the difficulties of life. Therefore, although they might not have been serious in themselves, they had an extremely serious role to play in the overall economy of his existence. Democritus did not believe that he had to feel constantly sad to prove that he recognised life to be sad. He danced every now and then because of a rightful confidence that he had already done justice, and would always in the future fully do justice, to the sadness of things.\n\nOnce we have acquired the skill of Cheerful Despair, a new range of possibilities for pleasure opens itself up to us. We will be amazed and touched when, once in a while, someone seems to understand a few things we mean. We will take note, with some astonishment, that not everyone has plans to murder or hurt others. We will make the most of the constrained but real opportunities we have. We will be free to enjoy the distinctive Cheerful Despair of those who have taken every fateful fact about life on board.\n\nSee also: Jolliness; Pessimism; Resilience; Sentimentality; Splitting and Integration.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Classical\n\nAt present, our culture is dominated by a Romantic outlook; its predecessor, and in many ways its more deserving alternative, is a Classical view of life.\n\nClassicism is founded upon an intense, pessimistic awareness of the frailties of human nature and on a suspicion of unexamined instinct. The Classical attitude knows that our emotions can frequently overpower our better insights, that we repeatedly misunderstand ourselves and others, and that we are never far from folly, harm and error.\n\nIn response, Classicism seeks via culture to correct the failings of our minds.\n\nClassicism is wary of our instinctive longing for perfection. In love, it counsels a gracious acceptance of the \u2018madness\u2019 inside each partner. It knows that ecstasy cannot last, and that the basis of all good relationships must be tolerance and mutual sympathy. Classicism has a high regard for domestic life; it sees apparently minor practical details as deeply worthy of care and effort; it doesn\u2019t think it would be degrading to tidy the laundry cupboard or do the household accounts, because these are modest points at which our own routines intersect with the great themes of life.\n\nClassicism understands that we need rules and, in the education of children, it trusts in the setting of boundaries. It loves, but does not idealise, the young.\n\nIn social life, Classicism counsels politeness as a way of keeping our true selves at bay. It understands that \u2018being yourself\u2019 is not something we should ever seek to be around anyone we care for. It also knows that small compliments and reassurances are of huge benefit to us, given our natural frailty and insecurity. It doesn\u2019t disdain the writing of thank-you notes.\n\nClassicism believes in evolution rather than revolution. It trusts that many good things have to be accomplished by institutions rather than by heroic lone agents, and accepts the necessary compromises that are involved in working with other people.\n\nIn relation to careers, the Classical attitude is at odds with the notion of vocation. It doesn\u2019t look to our instincts to solve the complex problems of what we should productively be doing with our lives. Instead it sees the need for careful and extensive self-questioning. But it also assumes from the outset that all work is laborious and frustrating in some ways, rejecting the notion of an \u2018ideal\u2019 job, much as it rejects the ideal in most spheres. It is a fervent believer in the concept of things being \u2018good enough\u2019.\n\nUnlike Romanticism, Classicism is cautiously welcoming of capitalism. It isn\u2019t inherently sceptical of profit; it doesn\u2019t see a concern with money as essentially sordid or shameful; money is just a resource that can be used foolishly or wisely. It doesn\u2019t think that talking of money is wrong in relation to the issue of who one might marry; it accepts the role of the material in a good life.\n\nClassicism has a particularly ambitious attitude towards art. It sees art as having a mission to seduce us, by means of an alluring, sensuous presentation, to keep wise and useful ideas at the front of our minds. Classical architecture, for instance, is ordered, tranquil and harmonious, because it recognises how vulnerable our inner spirit is to prompts from our environment and accepts how much we stand in need of poise, calm and serenity. It isn\u2019t afraid of things being a little boring. A \u2018quiet life\u2019 is no insult for a Classical mind.\n\nClassicism admires compromise around things one doesn\u2019t feel like compromising on; it has faith in slow and messy progress rather than in sudden ruptures. It is not shocked by venality, corruption or selfishness (it assumes that these are natural parts of the human character), but likes institutions, rules and laws because of their role in restricting the scope of our impulses.\n\nAlthough the Classical attitude often conflicts with things that are very popular, it doesn\u2019t in any way reject the value of popularity in itself. Indeed, its ambitions are firmly populist. If an idea is very complicated and difficult to grasp, Classicism assumes that it has not yet been brought properly into focus. It is suspicious of the narrows of academia and the cloistering of culture. The ideas we most need, it insists, can be presented lucidly and attractively and must be spread far and with charm to be of any use in taming our chaotic and confused minds. Classicism sees no fundamental reason why wisdom can\u2019t be very widespread. Indeed, it takes this to be the definitive, realistic task of civilisation.\n\nThe School of Life is built upon a Classical view of existence.\n\nSee also: Changing the World; FOMO; Romantic.",

This makes it very difficult to recognise our insecure feelings, especially if they have been triggered by a so-called \u2018small\u2019 matter, let alone communicate them to others in ways that would stand a chance of securing us the understanding and sympathy we crave. Rather than requesting reassurance endearingly and laying out our longing with charm, we might instead mask our needs beneath some brusque and hurtful behaviours guaranteed to frustrate our aims. Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, two major symptoms tend to show up.\n\nFirstly, we may become distant \u2013 or what psychotherapists call \u2018avoidant\u2019; we disguise our need for our lover.\n\nSecondly, we may become controlling \u2013 or what psychologists term \u2018anxious\u2019; we disguise our vulnerability behind an officious front.\n\nThe solution is to normalise a new and more accurate picture of emotional functioning: to make it clear just how healthy and mature it is to be fragile and in repeated need of reassurance, especially around sex. We suffer because adult life posits too robust a picture of how we operate. It tries to teach us to be implausibly independent and invulnerable. It suggests it might not be right to want a partner to show us they still really like us after they have been away for only a few hours. Or to want them to reassure us that they haven\u2019t gone off us, just on the basis that they didn\u2019t pay us much attention at a party and didn\u2019t want to leave when we did.\n\nYet it is precisely this sort of reassurance that we constantly need. We are never through with the requirement for comfort. This isn\u2019t a curse limited to the weak and the inadequate. In this area, insecurity is a sign of well-being. It means we haven\u2019t allowed ourselves to take other people for granted. It means we remain realistic enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly, and are invested enough to care.\n\nWe should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. \u2018I really need you; do you still want me?\u2019 should be the most normal of enquiries. We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and punitively macho term \u2018neediness\u2019. We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind some of our and our partner\u2019s most frosty, managerial or distant moments.\n\nSee also: Anxious Attachment; Avoidant Attachment; Emotional Translation.",

We spill, fall over, drop, smash \u2026 Clumsiness violates our self-image as a competent grown-up. It introduces us to a figure we may have been keen to escape from for a long time: the Inner Idiot.\n\nWe are liable to hate our Inner Idiot from afar, with a grim face, and try to deny its reality. But in our clumsy moments, we\u2019re reminded that the Idiot is still there, prompting us to drop our phone in the toilet bowl and forget important people\u2019s names at a party.\n\nThere is a seldom-explored path we might follow to break out of our shame: making friends with the Inner Idiot. Rather than to deny its existence, we might \u2013 with a degree of courage and good humour \u2013 accept that we simply are, at one level, big idiots who knock things over, spill drinks and make fools of ourselves in small and large ways most days of the year. But this does not, in itself, deny us the right to exist.\n\nClumsiness constitutes a humiliation if, and only if, we insist that the only way to prove ourselves acceptable is via a constant display of competence. But when we accept the incontrovertible and quasi-universal nature of inner idiocy and clumsiness, the discomfort and self-hatred are lifted. We feel we are alone with our idiocy because of a problem of perspective: we don\u2019t see the clumsiness of others as we do our own, because it happens in private and is carefully edited out of public life. Yet it is there in everyone, which is why, on the screen, there is such a widespread appetite for watching people fall off their bikes or walk into lampposts. Thanks to comedy shows, we can experience relief at evidence that desperate clumsiness is not just our own. It may look as if we\u2019re mocking; really, we are delighted to have found people as absurd as we are. The best kind of comedy invites us to see our own clumsiness as part of a collective and forgivable foolishness, not a private tragedy.\n\nWe see too that our own clumsiness is not what sets us apart from others but what we share (in secret) with everyone. We can accommodate our idiocy more sweetly inside ourselves when we trust that it is an intrinsic feature of being human; that it can be understood and forgiven in ourselves because it must be understood and forgiven in everyone.\n\nIf we knew the real lives of others more accurately, we would be much less scared and much less alone.\n\nSee also: Confidence; Inner Idiot, The; Inner Voices; Normality; Vulnerability.",

In our hearts, we are far more multiple and promiscuous than it is currently possible to be: beneath the calm outward fa\u00e7ade of the accountant might lie someone pining to try landscape gardening.

We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots in the future \u2013 and that is okay. There aren\u2019t any other available options for human beings.\n\nWe grow timid when we become too attached to an idea of our own seriousness and dignity, and are over-exposed to the respectable sides of others. Such are the pains people take to appear normal that we collectively create a phantasm \u2013 which hurts everyone \u2013 that normality and ongoing dignified competence might be possible.\n\nBut once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it doesn\u2019t matter so much if we do one more thing that might look a touch stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual from whom we asked directions in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn\u2019t be news; they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them \u2013 and every other person on the earth \u2013 are nitwits.\n\nThe risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially reduced. The fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to try things by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amid the endless disasters we\u2019d have factored in from the outset, it would work: we\u2019d get a kiss; we\u2019d make a friend; we\u2019d get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning, before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter much at all.\n\nSee also: Clumsiness; Confidence in Confidence; Inner Idiot, The; Normality; Perfectionism; Sane Insanity.",

Without fully realising it, we might find the idea of being truly confident strangely offensive, and secretly remain attached to hesitancy and modesty.\n\nSuspicion of confidence has traditionally enjoyed immense cultural endorsement. Christianity \u2013 for centuries the greatest influence on the mindset of the West \u2013 was highly sceptical about those who think too well of themselves. While the meek basked in divine favour, the arrogant would be the last to enter the kingdom of heaven. The political theory of Karl Marx added to this argument a set of ideas apparently proving that economic success was founded upon the exploitation of others. No wonder it may feel as if \u2013 to be moral citizens \u2013 we should steer clear of all overly robust assertions of our own interests.\n\nYet this attitude too can carry dangers. We may lack the confidence not to be cruel and promote greed, but to fight for kindness and wisdom. Our lack of confidence in confidence may be allowing degraded versions of self-assertion to thrive.\n\nMaybe we are just being unfair. Our negative view of confidence can be overly dependent on the quirks of our own histories, or on the sort of people in whom we first encountered confidence, who were not its best or most reliable representatives. Our real problem may not be confidence so much as a lack of other virtues such as manners, charm, wit and generosity. We may be wrongly diagnosing the root of our objections. There may be a danger of growing into braggarts, self-seekers and blowhards. But confidence is in its essence compatible with remaining sensitive, kind, witty and softly spoken. It might be brutishness, not confidence, that we hate.\n\nFurthermore, our attraction to meekness may mask some rather cowardly resentments against self-assertion. We might not so much admire timidity as fear giving confidence a try. It was this species of self-protective deception that particularly fascinated Nietzsche. He thought it a typical error of many Christians, who might pride themselves on their \u2018forgiveness\u2019 while simply trying to excuse their \u2018inability to take revenge\u2019. We should take care not to dress up our base deficiencies as godly virtues.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t enough to be kind, interesting, intelligent and wise inside: we need to develop the skill that allows us to make our talents active in the world at large. Confidence is what translates theory into practice. It should never be thought of as the enemy of good things; it is their crucial and legitimate catalyst. We should allow ourselves to develop confidence in confidence.\n\nSee also: Confidence.",

We want to banish pain and cure ourselves of the ills of being human.\n\nBut there\u2019s another less prominent yet highly relevant tradition that doesn\u2019t suppose that a share of our most serious problems can ever really be solved. Dying, missing out, failing or losing will not often be amenable to \u2018solutions\u2019 of the sort a scientific and technological age asks us to put our faith in.\n\nThe Romantic impulse is to insist that every genuine ill must have an equally potent cure. When facing hardship, we are told that we should redouble our efforts, and never rest until we have altered our destinies. We must rage against the obstacles arrayed against us and overcome them through a bold and stubborn force of will.\n\nSuch messages have their place, but they may also, at points, be indistinguishable from cruelty. Kindness lies not only in pushing other people towards solutions; it is also made up of a willingness to console them for the awful but unavoidable presence of tragedy.\n\nThe word \u2018consolation\u2019 does not have a good reputation. It sounds like a loser\u2019s counsel; something we would be interested in only when other and better options have been exhausted. Yet in relation to some of the largest challenges, consolation is what we need above all else. Sometimes there will simply be no solutions, yet we can be helped nevertheless. We can be comforted by a sense that we are not alone in our suffering; that others care for us; that many have been here before, and that there are reasons \u2013 however dark and appalling \u2013 why we have ended up in this place. Consolation doesn\u2019t seek to tell us that our problems are minor or can be ingeniously worked through. Rather, it dismantles our excessive remaining hopes and reinterprets our particular misery as a feature of a universal and ultimately unavoidable story of woe.\n\nConsolation invites us to look with tenderness on the generic sorrows of humanity of which we have, in time, been allotted our necessary share. Consolation aspires to turn rage and confusion into mourning and melancholy.\n\nSee also: Artistic Consolation; Flowers; Jolliness; Melancholy; Sentimentality; Tragedy.",

But our crush ignores a fundamental truth about people that Romanticism blithely ignores: that everyone, even the most apparently accomplished being, is radically imperfect and, were we to spend a long time around them, possibly maddening (even those who have adorable hair or the sweetest way of folding their skirt under them as they sit down on a park bench). We can\u2019t yet know what the problems will be, but we can and should be certain that they are there, lurking somewhere behind the fa\u00e7ade, waiting for time to unfurl them.\n\nWe have to impress this truth upon our Romantic minds \u2013 otherwise, in comparison with a crush, every actual relationship we ever have will seem horrendous and doomed. If we truly believe what our imaginations tell us during crushes, we\u2019ll have no logical choice other than to break off our partnerships, which are likely to be somewhat disappointing yet deeply real and ultimately \u2018good enough\u2019.\n\nIn order to enjoy a crush we have to understand that that is what it is. If we think that we are encountering a person who will make us happy, who will be an ideal person to live with and grow old with, we are inadvertently destroying the specific satisfaction that a crush brings. The pleasure depends on our recognising that we are imagining an ideal person, not finding a real one.\n\nTo crush well is to realise that the lovely person we sketch in our heads is our creation: a creation that says more about us than them. But what it says about us is important. The crush gives us access to our own ideals. We may not really be getting to know another person properly, but we are growing our insight into who we really are.\n\nSee also: Cure for Unrequited Love; Incumbent Problem, The; Long-Term Love; Love as Generosity; Romantic Instinct; Splitting and Integration.",

We might think this is because what they\u2019re showing us is sad, but there\u2019s something more peculiar at work. Often, we start crying not when things are horrible, but when they are suddenly and unexpectedly the opposite: when they are unusually sweet, tender, joyful, innocent or kind. Weeping in such circumstances is puzzling, but tells us something important: it\u2019s a sign of how hard our lives have become.\n\nPerhaps in a film a father who has been bullying or distant one day turns shyly to his son and admits: \u2018I always loved you; I never knew how to tell you this; I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 Or in a story we\u2019re reading to a child, there might be a page where the penguin tells its friend: \u2018I will never leave you as long as I live \u2026 \u2019\n\nWe cry when art reminds us of what we long for (forgiveness, reconciliation, loyalty) and when it prompts us to remember what we lack. Art evokes all the lost innocence of the world and of our own lives, against which the toughness of things stands out more acutely. The loveliness and goodness on display in art can make the actual ugliness of our existence all the more vivid. We cry at poignant reminders of an elusive paradise, at what we crave for and have been exiled from.\n\nIf we were to try creating a robot that could cry at films, with books or at the museum, we would have to do something apparently rather cruel: we would have to ensure that this robot knew about suffering, that it was able to hate itself, to feel confused and frustrated, to ache and hope that it didn\u2019t have to ache. It is against this kind of background of pain and sober maturity that beautiful scenes in films or works of art become important rather than merely nice. Our tears tell us something key: that our lives are tougher than they were when we were little, and that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is correspondingly all the more intense.\n\nSee also: Jolliness.",

It has been dark and cramped in the corridors of culture and hardly anyone other than certain accredited experts has been tempted or allowed to visit. Their labours have had a lot of prestige, but in truth, the material has been like metal in ore: impractical in its raw state.\n\nFor culture to be of use to us, it needs to go through a process of refinement, which may involve radical, even drastic, editorial moves. Insights have to be forcefully separated from contexts and then twinned with real-world issues. They must be translated from an arcane language of the deep into a spoken language of the surface. Finally, as in gold mining, only a very small portion of what was originally dug out will ever be usable to make the finished precious item that is sought: in this case, a good idea.\n\nBy being treated with immense reverence, and refusing any quick extraction of their essential wisdom, works of culture risk becoming painfully inert in our world.

      "content": "### \u00b6 Culture Can Replace Scripture\n\nWhen religion began to go into decline in northwestern Europe in the second half of the 19th century, many thoughtful people wondered what would fill the enormous gap it left behind. Where would we derive the consolation and community that religions had once so persuasively offered? How would we learn forgiveness? How could gratitude be instilled? Where would awe come from?\n\nOne penetrating answer came from an influential group of intellectuals in France, England and Germany who proposed that there was a highly serviceable, ready-made replacement for Scripture to hand; something that could have all the profundity, utility and emotional reach of the old canon: Culture.\n\n\u2018Culture can replace Scripture\u2019 became the new rallying cry of secularising societies. In the novels of Jane Austen and Tolstoy, in the paintings of Chardin and Delacroix, in the music of Schubert and Chopin, it was alleged, there could be just the right material to make up for what humanity was losing through the decline of faith.\n\nIt was on this basis that a large number of cultural projects were undertaken with public money: enormous libraries were built, museums were put up that looked like temples (\u2018Museums will be our new cathedrals\u2019, was the rallying cry) and humanities departments were started in almost all national universities. Some of what we had once found in a Bible we were now to find in the best novels and epic poems.\n\nThe Reading Room of the British Library in London (now part of the British Museum) was built at huge government expense in the 1850s. Not coincidentally, the vast dome was precisely designed to be three feet wider than that of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome \u2013 for centuries the largest and most famous church in the world.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, opened in 1885, was designed by the foremost Dutch architect of churches, Pierre Cuypers, and looked (on purpose) almost exactly like a cathedral.\n\nThe idea that Culture might replace Scripture is a beautiful and highly valid one. But it is also an idea that, despite the hopes of its earliest proponents, has failed entirely. If one showed up at any museum in the world looking for redemption, solace and friendship (as one might in a religious building), one would become an instant object of suspicion. If one enrolled on a philosophy degree in any university with a view to learning \u2018how to live and die well\u2019 (as the temples once taught one to do), one would be quickly disappointed by the curriculum on offer and probably ejected from the course at an early juncture.\n\nThe British Library Reading Room (now part of the British Museum).\n\nThe architecture of this room deliberately recalls the awe-inspiring and noble spaces of the grandest churches.\n\nThe Great Hall, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\n\nCulture truly can deliver wisdom and emotional education, but the guardians of Culture \u2013 those who presently control the cultural machine, with its broadcasters, museums and universities \u2013 have no interest in honouring this potential. They care instead about the preservation of texts, the display of works, the cataloguing of dates, the analysis of linguistic tropes, and a range of comparable academic pieties. Wisdom, explicit guidance and emotional education are not on the agenda. In the real world, Culture has not replaced Scripture.\n\nMeanwhile, the emotional needs of a secular society remain as intense and as unattended as ever. We have been left to our own devices, without the support of the great public institutions that were originally intended to assist us. The promise of the domed reading rooms and cathedral-like museums remains to be adequately discovered and judiciously exploited.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Art, The Purpose of; Cultural Mining; Philosophy; Popularisation; Popularity; Secularisation; Self-Help Books.",

Our sorrow is accompanied by a certainty that if only the elusive being would return our smiles, come for dinner or marry us, we would know bliss. Epochal happiness seems tantalisingly close, wholly real and yet maddeningly out of reach.\n\nAt such moments, we are often counselled to try to forget the beloved. Given their lack of interest, we should try to think of something or someone else. Yet this kindness is deeply misguided. The cure for love does not lie in ceasing to think of the fugitive lover, but in learning to think more intensely and constructively about who they might really be.\n\nFrom close up, every human who has ever lived proves deeply challenging. At close quarters, we are all trying propositions. We are short-tempered, vain, deceitful, crass, sentimental, woolly, over- or under-emotional and chaotic. What prevents us from holding this in mind in relation to certain people is simply a lack of knowledge. On the basis of a few charming outside details, we assume that the target of our passion may miraculously have escaped the fundamentals of the human condition.\n\nThey haven\u2019t. We just haven\u2019t got to know them properly. This is what makes unrequited love so intense, so long-lasting and so vicious. By preventing us from properly growing close to them, the beloved also prevents us from tiring of them in the cathartic and liberating manner that is the gift of requited love. It isn\u2019t their charms that are keeping us magnetised; it is our lack of knowledge of their flaws.\n\nThe cure for unrequited love is, in structure, therefore very simple. We must get to know them better. The more we discovered of them, the less they would look like the solution to all our problems. We would discover the endless small ways in which they were irksome; we\u2019d get to know how stubborn, how critical, how cold and how hurt by things that strike us as meaningless they could be. If we got to know them better, we would realise how much they had in common with everyone else.\n\nPassion can never withstand too much exposure to the full reality of another person. The unbounded admiration on which it is founded is destroyed by the knowledge that a properly shared life inevitably brings.\n\nThe cruelty of unrequited love isn\u2019t really that we haven\u2019t been loved back; it\u2019s that our hopes have been aroused by someone who can never disappoint us, someone who we will have to keep believing in because we lack the knowledge that would set us free.\n\nIn the absence of a direct cure, we must undertake an imaginative one. Without quite knowing the details, we must accept that they would eventually prove decisively irritating. Everyone does. We have to believe this, not because we know it exactly of them, but because they are human, and we know this dark but deeply cheering fact about everyone who has ever lived.\n\nSee also: Crushes; Incumbent Problem, The.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Day of Judgement\n\nAcross time, various religions have come up with an idea that, today, can sound extremely odd: the Day of Judgement.\n\nThe suggestion has been that, after we die, the merit of our entire lives, with every relevant factor included, will be judged by an all-knowing, all-understanding and ultimately decisive judge: God, perhaps with the help of some angels, against a background of celestial music. Thereafter, the good people will be sent to heaven, the bad ones to hell.\n\nIt is a fanciful speculation, but it enforces some eminently sensible and highly important principles of how to live wisely and kindly among others. It operates as a reminder of the dangers of judging each other too readily and confidently, of quickly deciding who is valuable and who can be ignored, of too narrowly settling the question of who is guilty and who innocent.\n\nThe theory of the Day of Judgement proposes that the merits and demerits of other people are fundamentally mysterious: important factors about their situation will never be known to us, and we are likely to get things wrong if we rush to assess others\u2019 value on the basis of outward markers. It commands us to pause our judgemental proclivities and snobbery and to adopt instead a permanent attitude of modest and kindly neutrality. The Day of Judgement is useful not so much as a prediction about an event that will unfold on the other side of the grave; it matters as a warning to us not to foreclose on people whose true natures and situations we cannot possibly understand as we truly or fairly should.\n\nThe Day of Judgement is a strategic counter to the excesses of a meritocratic worldview. Faith in a meritocracy insinuates that we can, without excessive difficulty, judge one another now, almost at a glance, on the basis of what we have achieved, usually in our professional or personal lives. The divorcees and the sacked are the failures in this story; the sick as well.\n\nIn fact, where people end up is a desperately and soberingly random matter. Career, romantic and health success reflect only certain parts of who a person is. We might be very witty but not cut out for the top, or be truly extraordinary parents but not very focused on money, or highly imaginative but rather shy, or wise but gravely ill. We might have had a brilliant idea but lack the necessary powers of execution or been cursed by bad timing.\n\nIf we judge others too quickly on the outward signs, we may miss the best things about them; they in turn may make the same painful mistake with us. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t now have grand and powerful institutions continually reminding us \u2013 via magnificent works of art \u2013 of the need not to judge too soon, but we can look back at the Day of Judgement as a reminder of a cautious manner of assessing human achievement that, however eccentrically framed it might be, we continue to owe to ourselves and others.\n\nSee also: Luck; Meritocracy; Secularisation; Snobbery; Tragedy.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Domesticity\n\nWithout our quite noticing it, and to our immense misfortune, the value of domestic life has come to occupy a degraded position in our collective vision of importance.\n\nThe pleasures and challenges of managing a household can be made to seem almost comically trivial in comparison to making a great fortune in business, succeeding in sport or entertainment, or occupying a prominent place in the media.\n\nYet the small, bounded, repetitive issues of the domestic realm play a great part in the essential task of living and dying well. \u2018If we wish to be happy, we must learn to cultivate our garden\u2019 was Voltaire\u2019s legendary and deliberately unheroic advice on the matter.\n\nA consequence of our disregard for domesticity is that we often become enraged by what we consider \u2018small\u2019 irritants. Couples fall out spectacularly over whether it is necessary to use a chopping board when cutting bread, how clean the bathroom needs to be or whether it matters if a drawer is left slightly open. What fuels the conflict is a sense that these are trivial matters, unworthy of careful discussion, on which there may be varied and dignified schools of thought.\n\nThe fiendish irony is that we behave with exactly this respect around other details that matter much less in our lives. Art historians will hold an international conference on the pose of a hand in a painting by Picasso; huge corporations will devote immense efforts to finding just the right words to announce the merits of a chocolate bar to the world.\n\nWe don\u2019t always despise details; we are guided by the larger cultural picture of whether a detail deserves attention. Tragically, our culture currently assigns precious little importance to a great many details in the \u2018garden\u2019 of domesticity.\n\nSee also: Flowers; FOMO; Getting an Early Night; Glamour; Good Enough; Long-Term Love; Quiet Life, The; Small Pleasures.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Duty Trap, The\n\nWe start off in life being very interested in pleasure and fun. In our earliest years, we do little but hunt out situations that will amuse us, pursuing our hedonistic goals with the help of puddles, crayons, balls, teddies, computers and bits and pieces we find in the kitchen drawers. As soon as anything gets frustrating or boring, we simply give up and seek new sources of enjoyment \u2013 and no one appears to mind very much.\n\nThen, at around the age of five or six, we are introduced to a terrifying new reality: the Rule of Duty. This states that there are some things we must do, not because we like them or see the point of them, but because other people (intimidating, authoritative people who may be almost three times our size) expect us to do them \u2013 so, the big people sternly explain, we\u2019ll be able to earn money, buy a house and go on holiday about thirty years from now. It sounds pretty important \u2013 sort of.\n\nEven when we\u2019re back home and start crying and telling our parents that we don\u2019t want to do the essay for tomorrow, they may take the side of Duty and speak to us with anger and impatience \u2013 beneath which there is a lot of fear \u2013 about how people who can\u2019t complete a simple homework assignment on volcanoes (and want to build a treehouse instead) will never survive in the adult world.\n\nQuestions of what we actually enjoy doing, what gives us pleasure, still occasionally matter in later childhood, but only a bit. They become matters increasingly set aside from the day-today world of study, reserved for holidays and weekends. A basic distinction takes hold: pleasure is for hobbies, pain is for work.\n\nBy the time we finish university, this dichotomy is so entrenched that we usually can\u2019t conceive of asking ourselves too vigorously what we might really want to do with our lives: what it might be fun to do with the years that remain. It\u2019s not the way we\u2019ve learnt to think. The Rule of Duty has been the governing ideology for 80% of our time on earth \u2013 and it\u2019s become our second nature. We are convinced that a good job is meant to be substantially dull, irksome and annoying. Why else would someone pay us to do it?\n\nThe dutiful way of thinking has such high prestige because it sounds like a road to safety in a competitive and alarmingly expensive world. But the Rule of Duty is actually no guarantee of true security. Once we\u2019ve finished our education, it emerges as a sheer liability masquerading as a virtue. Duty grows positively dangerous. The reasons are two-fold.\n\nFirstly, it is because success in the modern economy will generally only go to those who can bring extraordinary dedication and imagination to their labours \u2013 which is only possible when one is, to a large extent, having fun (a state quite compatible with being exhausted and grumpy most of the time). Only when we are intrinsically motivated are we capable of generating the very high levels of energy and brainpower necessary to stand out from the competition. Work produced merely out of duty is limp and lacking next to that done out of love.\n\nSecondly, when our work is informed by our own sense of pleasure, we become more insightful about the pleasures of others \u2013 that is, of the clients and customers a business relies upon. We can best please our audiences when we have mobilised our own feelings of enjoyment.\n\nIn other words, pleasure is not the opposite of work; it is a key ingredient of successful work.\n\nYet we have to recognise that asking ourselves what we might really want to do \u2013 without any immediate or primary consideration for money or reputation \u2013 goes against our educationally embedded assumptions about what might keep us safe, and is therefore rather scary. It takes immense insight and maturity to stick with the truth: that we will best serve others \u2013 and can make our own greatest contribution to society \u2013 when we bring the most imaginative and most authentically personal sides of our nature into our work. Duty can guarantee us a basic income. Only sincere, pleasure-led work can generate sizeable success.\n\nWhen people are suffering under the Rule of Duty, it can be helpful to take a morbid turn and ask them to imagine what they might think of their lives from the vantage point of their deathbeds. The thought of death may usefully detach us from prevailing fears of what others think. The prospect of the end reminds us of an imperative higher still than a duty to society: a duty to ourselves, to our talents, to our interests and our passions. The deathbed point of view can spur us to perceive the hidden recklessness and danger within the dutiful path.\n\nSee also: Being \u2018Good\u2019; Meaningful Work; Vocation Myth.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Emotional Capitalism\n\nEmotional Capitalism refers to an economic system that is geared \u2013 far more than at present \u2013 towards the fulfilment of our higher needs; among these, the needs for emotional health, self-understanding, friendship, consolation and community.\n\nDespite all the factories, highways and logistics chains, the world economy is arguably as yet far too small and desperately undeveloped, for it is still not focused on addressing many of the issues that undermine our well-being. Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations, capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs, for sanitation, shelter, food supply and healthcare. The largest and most successful corporations have been those that have satisfied appetites that we would categorise as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow\u2019s famous pyramid of needs: oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, insurance and banking.\n\nA glance at the pyramid reveals a fascinating possibility: that the future growth of business may lie in meeting the higher needs further up the pyramid, in the areas of love and belonging, esteem and self-actualisation. Capitalists and companies are seemingly \u2013 semi-consciously \u2013 aware of this issue. The evidence lies in advertising. Advertising almost always tries to sell us goods by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfilment, authenticity, good relationships and a sense of true achievement.\n\nHowever, as yet, the corporations who pay for the advertisements are not devoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked. Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy; it already trades on all the right fantasies. It\u2019s just that there are, as yet, few of the truly right products and services to satisfy the appetites that have been aroused.\n\nAn organised response to our higher needs is not novel. Religions used to address them. Catholicism, if seen as a business, would be the second largest corporation in the world. Art galleries and museums have shared some of the character of religions and similarly have tried to address our higher needs, although their clients have tended to be governments and nations rather than individual customers.\n\nWhat we call \u2018a business idea\u2019 is at heart an as-yet- unexplored need. To trace the future shape of capitalism, we only have to think of all the needs we have that are poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world. We need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities. We need help in bringing up children. We need help in calming down at key moments (the cost of our high anxiety and rage is appalling in aggregate). We require assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace and understanding where we can best deploy them. We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires. Elegant town centres, charming high streets and sweet villages are in desperately short supply and are therefore absurdly expensive \u2013 just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed but were very rare and only for the very rich.\n\nThese higher needs are not trivial or minor wants \u2013 little things we could easily survive without. In many ways they are central to our lives. We have simply accepted, without really thinking about it, that there is nothing we can do to address them. Yet, to be able to structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb. We don\u2019t know what the businesses of the future will look like, just as no one in 1975 could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google. But we know the direction in which we need to head: we need the drive and inventiveness of capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life. This will offer an exit from the failings and misery that attend capitalism today. In a nutshell, the problem is that we waste resources on unimportant things. Ultimately, we are wasteful because we lack self-knowledge; we use consumption to divert or quieten anxieties or in a vain search for status and belonging. If we could address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained, our work more meaningful and our profits more honourable.\n\nSee Also: Good Business; Good Demand; Good Materialism; Higher Needs; Misemployment; Overeating; Secularisation.",

We invest hugely in ensuring that knowledge painfully built up in one generation can be reliably transferred to another.\n\nHowever, our Romantic culture places a curious limit around the idea of what can fairly be taught and transferred. We know that we can teach people how to fly a plane, perform brain surgery or analyse the tax returns of medium-sized businesses \u2013 and a host of institutions exist to carry out instruction in these fields.\n\nHowever, it would sound distinctly odd, even eerie, to imagine that we might learn, for example, how to love someone, how to become wise, how to grow less agitated, or how to die well. Our Romantic culture assumes that in these fields, what we call the area of Emotional Intelligence, we are simply more or less born knowing how to live, and that there is precious little that one human could ever systematically teach another.\n\nEmotional Education is the term given to the contrary belief that we can and must train ourselves in our emotional conduct. We should, its adherents propose, be schooled to respond in more equitable and intelligent ways to our impulses, desires and fears. Emotional Education proposes that emotions are not fixed, unchangeable or even reliable tendencies. We can learn how to be more forgiving; how to extend the range of our sympathies; how to grow more confident, accepting, patient and self-aware.\n\nIt is because we have \u2013 until now \u2013 not taken Emotional Education seriously enough that our species has grown ever more technically adept while retaining the level of wisdom of our earliest days, with catastrophic results. We are evolved monkeys with nuclear weapons. It appears that the fate of civilisation now depends on our capacity to master the mechanisms of Emotional Education before it is too late.\n\nEmotional Education extends far beyond formal education as we have conceived of it to date. Although it should ideally include specialised courses in every year of school or college, Emotional Education is more than something that should take place in classrooms at the hands of teachers and come to a halt around the age of twenty-one.\n\nThe central vehicle for the transfer of Emotional Intelligence is culture, from its highest to its most popular level. Culture is the field that can ritualise and consistently promote the absorption of wisdom. The \u2018lessons\u2019 of culture might be embedded in a tragedy or a TV series, a pop song or a novel, a work of architecture or a news bulletin. We can envisage the entire apparatus of culture as a subtle mechanism designed to point us towards greater wisdom.\n\nWe will never progress as a species, and will indeed grow into ever-greater technologically armed menaces to ourselves, until we have accepted the challenges and opportunities of Emotional Education.\n\nSee also: Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Scepticism; Faulty Walnut, The; Secularisation; Self-Help Books; Transference; Wisdom.",

We are used to referring to intelligence as a general quality, without unpicking a particular variety that a person might possess; therefore, we do not tend to highlight the value of a distinctive sort of intelligence that currently does not enjoy the prestige it should.\n\nEvery sort of intelligence signals an ability to navigate well around a particular set of challenges: mathematical, linguistic, technical, commercial. When we say that someone is clever but has messed up their personal life, or that they have acquired a fortune but are restless and sad, or that they are powerful but intolerant and unimaginative, we are pointing to a deficit in what deserves to be called Emotional Intelligence.\n\nIn social life, we can feel the presence of Emotional Intelligence in a sensitivity to the moods of others and in a readiness to grasp the surprising things that may be going on for them beneath the surface. Emotional Intelligence recognises a role for interpretation and knows that a fiery outburst might be a disguised plea for help; that a political rant may be provoked by hunger; or that concealed within a forceful jolliness may be a sorrow that has been sentimentally disavowed.\n\nIn relation to ourselves, Emotional Intelligence shows up in a scepticism around our emotions, especially those of love, desire, anger, envy, anxiety and professional ambition. The Emotionally Intelligent refuse to trust their first impulses or the wisdom of their feelings. They know that hatred may mask love, that anger may be a cover for sadness, and that we are prone to huge and costly inaccuracies in whom we desire and what we seek.\n\nEmotional Intelligence is also what distinguishes those who are crushed by failure from those who can greet the troubles of existence with a melancholy and at points darkly humorous resilience. The Emotionally Intelligent appreciate the role of well-handled pessimism within the overall economy of a good life.\n\nEmotional Intelligence is not an inborn talent. It is the result of education \u2013 specifically in how to interpret ourselves, where our emotions arise from, how our childhoods influence us and how we might best navigate our fears and wishes. In the Utopia, it would be routine to be taught Emotional Intelligence from the youngest age, before we have the opportunity to make too many mistakes.\n\nOur Technical Intelligence has led us to tame nature and conquer the planet. A wiser, saner future for the race will depend on our capacity to master and then seductively teach the rudiments of Emotional Intelligence \u2013 while there is still time.\n\nSee also: Emotional Education; Emotional Scepticism; Inner Voices; Philosophical Meditation; Success at School vs. Success in Life; Wisdom.",

Such a pronouncement is psychologically impossible. Envy is a fundamental fact for all of us. The trick isn\u2019t simply to suffer from it, but to learn from it.\n\nEnvy matters because it can provide us with a host of insights into our potential, our passions and our interests. Every time we envy someone, we are encountering a clue as to who we want to be deep down \u2013 and in part probably could be. We don\u2019t envy everyone. We envy those who we feel have what we deserve, what we are interested in, and what we could perhaps attain one day. Every person we envy contains suggestions as to our future possible selves.\n\nThe real problem isn\u2019t that we feel envy, but that we envy in such unexamined and fruitless ways. Firstly, we feel deeply embarrassed by our envy, and so tend to hide the emotion from our conscious selves. Secondly, we don\u2019t have faith that there is anything to be learnt from envy, and so we hope the mood will pass, like a vicious fever.\n\nThirdly, we start to envy certain individuals in their entirety, when, if we took a moment to analyse their lives calmly, we would realise that it was only a small part of what they had done that really resonated with, and could guide, our own next steps. It might not be the whole of the restaurant entrepreneur\u2019s life we wanted, but really just their skill at building up institutions. We might not truly want to be a potter, yet we might need a little more of the playfulness on display in the work of one example we read about in a supplement.\n\nThe more we drill into our envy, the less attached we need to be to the actual lives of the people who triggered it.\n\nThe qualities we admire don\u2019t just belong to the very specific, very attractive locations in which we discovered them. These qualities can be pursued in lesser, weaker (but still real) doses in countless other places, opening up the possibility of creating many smaller, more manageable and more realistic versions of the lives we admire.\n\nSee also: Job Fixation.",

Their lives might have been destroyed by an illness that can now be prevented by a shot of the cheapest vaccine; they laboured under terrifying convictions we now regard as baseless illusions. A child might die of hunger on the very land now occupied by a bountiful supermarket. Their misery was so profound, and yet, from where we stand, so preventable. They would have envied us, if they could have realised what we have.\n\nBut there is another thought that might emerge: that at some point a future society might look back on our mode of life with similar feelings of pity. They might hear stories of our fractious relationships, which so often end in divorce, and feel immense tenderness for our unnecessary suffering \u2013 avoided by them via careful counselling, digital head implants and inter-cranial education from birth about how to manage the complexities of life with another person. They may look sorrowfully on our working lives, in which we so rarely feel that what we are doing is truly important; or at the difficulty we have in finding and keeping true friendships; or at the regularity with which families prove disappointing.\n\nWhen we think of envying the future, we are primed to do so in terms of technology. Future humans might be able to vacation on Mars or look youthful when they are two hundred and three. But the real poignancy may turn out to be psychological. Our successors may master the art of being somewhat less dissatisfied, angry, confused, bored and vengeful.\n\nThe pity we imagine they might experience for us is really an echo of the pity we should legitimately feel for ourselves. We are registering ways in which our lives are genuinely sorrowful in comparison with what they might be.\n\nBut the good news is that the future does not really depend on technological breakthroughs; it could, curiously and tantalisingly, start to be available now, if only we could learn to act upon the vast reserves of wisdom our species has already so carefully and so painfully accumulated.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Cultural Mining; Utopia.",

The reality is that we are equal before the law, equal in rights, but we are definitely not equal in our circumstances. The modern age combines an ideology of equality with radical material inequality.\n\nThis has led to a proliferation of envy. Envy is a curious emotion in that we don\u2019t feel it in relation to everyone who has more than us. We envy those who have more than us and to whom we feel equal. Nowadays we would be unlikely to feel envious of a member of the British monarchy. Their world is too remote from our own, their accents too odd, their characters alien. Despite them having much more than us, despite their palaces, carriages and art works, we can consider their lives without the slightest distress. However, when we hear of someone our age, with a slightly larger apartment than ours, a somewhat more dynamic career and an ability to send their children to a slightly better school, our envy may grow boundless and quasi-obsessive.\n\nIt is the feeling of equality, and not just differences in wealth and achievement, that drives envy. The closer two people feel, the more equal they are in each other\u2019s eyes, and the more any divergence of success will have the power to dispirit and enrage them. And the problem with the modern world is that it constantly informs us that we are all equal deep down, while simultaneously holding up for our torture examples of people who have secured uncommon degrees of fame and wealth for themselves.\n\nIn the old world, it would not have occurred to any ordinary person to envy an aristocrat or monarch. These exalted characters lived in separate realms and went to great lengths to show the rest of the world how different they were, and how inconceivable it was that one could ever get to be like them. Their clothes, habits and ways of life made it clear that one should never assume they were normal in any way.\n\nLouis XIV of France liked to wander about in ermine cloaks and gold brocade coats. He carried a golden stick. He sometimes donned a suit of armour. It was extremely haughty and unfair, of course, but it did have one great advantage. You could not possibly believe that you, in all your profane ordinariness, would ever reach the summit. You couldn\u2019t possibly envy the mighty, because envy only begins with the theoretical possibility that one might be rightfully owed what the envied person already has.\n\nBy contrast, modernity was founded on an apparently generous sense that everyone is owed the same things. Not in terms of current possessions and status, but in terms of potential. Yet it then performed a particularly challenging move: it made sure that we don\u2019t all end up having the same things.

      "content": "### \u00b6 Eudaimonia\n\nEudaimonia is an Ancient Greek word, particularly emphasised by the philosophers Plato and Aristotle, that deserves wider currency. It corrects the shortfalls in one of the most central, governing but insufficient terms in our contemporary idiom: happiness.\n\nWhen we nowadays try to articulate the purpose of our lives, it is to the word \u2018happiness\u2019 that we commonly have recourse. We tell ourselves and others that the ultimate rationale for our jobs, our relationships and the conduct of our day-to-day lives is the pursuit of happiness. It sounds like an innocent enough idea, but excessive reliance on the term means that we are frequently unfairly tempted to exit or at least heavily question a great many testing but worthwhile situations.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks resolutely did not believe that the purpose of life was to be happy; they proposed that it was to achieve eudaimonia, a word that has been best translated as \u2018fulfilment\u2019.\n\nWhat distinguishes happiness from fulfilment is pain. It is eminently possible to be fulfilled and, at the same time, under pressure, suffering physically or mentally, overburdened and frequently tetchy. This is a psychological nuance that the word \u2018happiness\u2019 makes it hard to capture, for it is tricky to speak of being happy yet unhappy or happy yet suffering. However, such a combination is readily accommodated within the dignified and noble-sounding letters of eudaimonia.\n\nThe word encourages us to trust that many of life\u2019s most worthwhile projects will at points be quite at odds with contentment and yet are worth pursuing nevertheless. Properly exploring our professional talents, managing a household, keeping a relationship going, creating a new business venture or engaging in politics \u2013 none of these goals is likely to leave us cheerful and grinning on a quotidian basis. They will involve us in all manner of challenges that will exhaust and enervate us, provoke and wound us. Yet we will, perhaps, at the end of our lives, still feel that the tasks were worth undertaking. Through them, we will have accessed something grander and more interesting than happiness: we will have made a difference.\n\nWith the word eudaimonia in mind, we can stop imagining that we should aim for a pain-free existence, and then berate ourselves unfairly for being in a bad mood. We will know that we are trying to do something far more important than smile: we are striving to do justice to our full human potential and to work in some small but key way towards the improvement of our species.\n\nSee also: Artistic Consolation; Meaning of Life, The; Pessimism; Resilience; Self-Help Books.",

We are in a state of what is known as Existential Angst.\n\nAt such moments, it pays to remember that the real choice is almost never between error and happiness but between varieties of suffering. This is the wisdom of the early 19th-century Danish Existential philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, summed up in a playful, but bleakly realistic and exasperated, outburst in his masterpiece, Either/Or:\n\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it \u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\n\nWe deserve pity \u2013 as does everyone else. We will make disastrous decisions, we will form mistaken relationships, we will embark on misguided careers, we will invest our savings foolishly and spend years on friendships with unreliable and disappointing knaves. But we can be consoled by a bitter truth: we have no better options, for the conditions of existence are intrinsically rather than accidentally frustrating.\n\nThere is, curiously, a persistent relief to be found in the knowledge of the inevitability of suffering. In the end, it is not darkness that dooms us, but the wrong sort of hope.\n\nSee also: Pessimism; Resilience.",

We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are only humiliated if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it. Our expectations determine what we will interpret as a triumph and what must count as a failure. \u2018With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,\u2019 wrote the psychologist William James; \u2018it is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities.

      "content": "### \u00b6 Fame\n\nFame seems to offer very significant benefits. The fantasies go like this: when you are famous, wherever you go, your good reputation will precede you. People will think well of you, because your merits have been impressively explained in advance. You will get warm smiles from admiring strangers. You won\u2019t need to make your own case laboriously on each occasion. When you are famous, you will be safe from rejection. You won\u2019t have to win over every new person. Fame will mean that other people will be flattered and delighted even if you are only slightly interested in them. They will be amazed to see you in the flesh. They will ask to take a photo with you. They will sometimes laugh nervously with excitement. Furthermore, no one will be able to afford to upset you. When you\u2019re not pleased with something, it will become a big problem for others. If you say your hotel room isn\u2019t up to scratch, the management will panic. Your complaints will be taken very seriously. Your happiness will become the focus of everyone\u2019s efforts. You will make or break other people\u2019s reputations. You\u2019ll be the boss.\n\nThe desire for fame has its roots in the experience of neglect and injury. No one would want to be famous who hadn\u2019t also, somewhere in the past, been made to feel insignificant. We sense the need for a great deal of admiring attention when we have been painfully exposed to earlier deprivation. Perhaps one\u2019s parents were hard to impress. They never noticed one much, they were so busy on other things, focusing on other famous people, unable to have or express kind feelings, or just working too hard. There were no bedtime stories and one\u2019s school reports weren\u2019t the subject of praise and admiration. That\u2019s why one dreams that one day the world will pay attention. When we\u2019re famous, our parents will have to admire us too (this throws up an insight into one of the great signs of good parenting: that your child has no desire to be famous).\n\nBut even if our parents were warm and full of praise, there might still be a problem. It might be that it was the buffeting and indifference of the wider world (starting with the schoolyard) that was intolerable after the early years of adulation at home. One might have emerged from familial warmth and been mortally hurt that strangers were not as kind and understanding as one had come to expect. The crushing experience of humiliation might even have been vicarious: one\u2019s mother being rudely dismissed by a waiter; one\u2019s father standing awkwardly alone.\n\nWhat is common to all dreams of fame is that being known to strangers emerges as a solution to a hurt. It presents itself as the answer to a deep need to be appreciated and treated decently by other people.\n\nYet fame cannot accomplish what is asked of it. It does have advantages, which are evident. But it also introduces a new set of very serious disadvantages, which the modern world refuses to view as structural rather than incidental. Every new famous person who disintegrates, breaks down in public or loses their mind is judged in isolation, rather than being interpreted as a victim of an inevitable pattern within the pathology of fame.\n\nOne wants to be famous out of a desire for kindness. But the world isn\u2019t generally kind to the famous for very long. The reason is basic: the success of any one person involves humiliation for lots of others. The celebrity of a few people will always contrast painfully with the obscurity of many. Being famous upsets people. For a time, the resentment can be kept under control, but it is never somnolent for long. When we imagine fame, we forget that it is inextricably connected to being too visible in the eyes of some, to bugging them unduly, to coming to be seen as the plausible cause of their humiliation: a symbol of how the world has treated them unfairly.\n\nSoon enough, the world will start to go through the rubbish bags of the famous; it will comment negatively on their appearance; it will pore over their setbacks; it will judge their relationships; it will mock their new movies.\n\nFame makes people more, not less, vulnerable, because it throws them open to unlimited judgement. Everyone is wounded by a cruel assessment of their character or merit. But the famous have an added challenge in store. The assessments will come from legions of people who would never dare to say to their faces what they can express from the safety of the newspaper office or screen. We know from our own lives that a nasty remark can take a day or two to process.\n\nPsychologically, the famous are the last people on earth to be well equipped to deal with what they\u2019re going through. After all, they only became famous because they were wounded, because they had thin skin; because they were in some respects a bit ill. Now, far from compensating them adequately for their disease, fame aggravates it exponentially. Strangers will voice their negative opinions in detail, unable or unwilling to imagine that famous people bleed far more quickly than anyone else. They might even think that the famous aren\u2019t listening (although one wouldn\u2019t become famous if one didn\u2019t suffer from a compulsion to listen too much).\n\nEvery worst fear about oneself (that one is stupid, ugly, not worthy of existence) will daily be confirmed by strangers. One will be exposed to the fact that people one has never met, about whom one would have only goodwill, actively loathe one. One will learn that detestation of one\u2019s personality is a badge of honour in some quarters. Sometimes the attacks will be horribly insightful. At other times, they\u2019ll make no sense to anyone who really knows one. But the criticisms will lodge in people\u2019s minds nevertheless \u2013 and no lawyer, court case or magician can ever delete them.\n\nNeedless to say, as a hurt celebrity, one won\u2019t be eligible for sympathy. The very concept of a hurt celebrity is a joke, about as moving for the average person as the sadness of a tyrant.\n\nTo sum up: fame really just means you get noticed a great deal, not that you are understood, appreciated or loved.\n\nAt an individual level, the only mature strategy is to give up on fame. The aim that lay behind the desire for fame remains important. One still wants to be appreciated and understood, but the wise person accepts that celebrity does not actually provide these things. Appreciation and understanding are only available through individuals one knows and cares about, not via groups of a thousand or a million strangers. There is no shortcut to friendship, which is what the famous person is in effect seeking.\n\nFor those who are already famous, the only way to stay sane is to stop listening to what the wider world is saying. This applies to the good things as much as to the bad. It is best not to know. The wise person knows that their products need attention. But they make a clear distinction between the purely practical needs of marketing and advocacy and the intimate desire to be liked and treated with justice and kindness by people they don\u2019t know.\n\nAt a collective, political level we should pay great attention to the fact that, today, so many people (particularly young ones) want to be famous \u2013 and even see fame as a necessary condition for a successful life. Rather than dismiss this wish, we should grasp its underlying worrying meaning: they want to be famous because they are not being respected, because citizens have forgotten how to accord one another the degree of civility, appreciation and decency that everyone craves and deserves. The desire for fame is a sign that an ordinary life has ceased to be good enough.\n\nThe solution is not to encourage ever more people to become famous, but to put massive efforts into encouraging a greater level of politeness and consideration for everyone, in families and communities, in workplaces, in politics, in the media, and at all income levels, especially modest ones. A healthy society will give up on the understandable but erroneous belief that fame might guarantee the kindness of strangers.\n\nSee also: Love as Generosity.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Fashion\n\nOnce, we were all dressed by someone else. Parents picked out a T-shirt; the school dictated what colour our trousers should be. But at some point, we were granted the opportunity to discover who we might be in the world of clothes. We had to decide for ourselves about collars and necklines, fit, colours, patterns, textures and what goes (or doesn\u2019t go) with what. We learnt to speak about ourselves in the language of garments. Despite the potential silliness and exaggeration of sections of the fashion industry, assembling a wardrobe is a serious and meaningful exercise.\n\nBased on our looks, background, job or certain tendencies in our behaviour, others are liable to come to quick and not very rounded decisions about who we are. Only too often, their judgement doesn\u2019t get us right. They might assume that, because of where we come from, we must be quite snobbish or resentful; based on our work we might get typecast as dour or superficial; the fact that we\u2019re sporty might lead people to see us as not terribly cerebral; an attachment to a particular political outlook might be associated with being unnervingly earnest or cruel.\n\nClothes provide us with an opportunity to correct some of these assumptions. When we get dressed, we are, in effect, operating as a tour guide, offering to show people around ourselves. We\u2019re highlighting interesting or attractive things about who we are \u2013 and we\u2019re clearing up misconceptions in the process.\n\nWe\u2019re acting like artists painting a self-portrait: deliberately guiding the viewer\u2019s perception of who we might be. Clothes are a way of making a crucial introduction to the self. This explains the curious phenomenon whereby, if we\u2019re staying with good friends, we can spend a lot less time thinking about our clothes, compared with the anxiety about what to wear that can grip us at other times. We might sit around in a dressing gown. They already know who we are; they\u2019re not relying on our clothes for clues.\n\nBy choosing particular sorts of clothes, we are shoring up our more fragile or tentative characteristics. We\u2019re communicating to others who we are and strategically reminding ourselves. Our wardrobes contain some of our most carefully written lines of autobiography.\n\nSee also: Architecture; Good Materialism.",

Paradoxically, the way to greater lucidity is not to place ever deeper faith in our walnuts; it is to keep their misleading, exaggerated and deceptive nature constantly at the forefront of our thoughts. Wisdom begins with a recognition of certain of our fundamental inclinations to folly and blindness.\n\nThe walnut is marked by a range of stubborn defects that are dangerously hard to extirpate, let alone recognise in good time. It is prone to desiring and fearing without properly assessing reality. It doesn\u2019t understand its own motives or pleasures. It quickly locks onto answers and is vain and squeamish around the arduous business of self-examination. When pressed for clarification, it typically grows blank or aggressive. It is slyly expedient, preferring short-term sentimental peace to hard long-term truths. It is constantly derailed \u2013 in ways it haughtily refuses to recognise \u2013 by hormones, low sugar levels and tiredness. It doesn\u2019t readily accept its physical nature, and often petulantly resists an imperative to get an early night. It is deeply marked by its early childhood experiences in ways it can\u2019t fathom without many hours of adult introspection (which it is generally disinclined to invest in). It repeatedly transfers emotions from the past onto the present, where they don\u2019t quite belong, and thereby over- or under-reacts to situations in the here and now. It is structurally unable to count its own blessings and is overwhelmingly focused on the future. It is wired for perpetual anxiety and nagging dissatisfaction.\n\nAll the more pity then, that we inhabit an essentially Romantic culture that proclaims its awe of the power of our brains and is reverent towards their first verdicts and schemes \u2013 what we call our \u2018instincts\u2019. We hear that it is good to \u2018trust our feelings\u2019, that reason is \u2018cold\u2019 and that there are dangers we might end up \u2018thinking too much\u2019 (rather than, as is always the case, merely thinking very badly, which is a different thing).\n\nWhen we follow our walnuts\u2019 instinctive promptings, our lives threaten rapidly to come undone: we don\u2019t pay sufficient attention to our biases and blindspots; we become entangled in relationships that repeat harmful childhood patterns; we pursue careers unsuited to our true yet unknown natures; we waste a lot of time on things that don\u2019t properly satisfy us \u2026\n\nCompensation for the flaws of our minds is the task of Culture. Culture, which includes the arts, education and politics, can be in a position to counter-balance the eccentricities and foolishness of our walnuts. Culture can alert us to our flaws, make us cautious around our instincts and instil better habits of thinking and feeling. It should endlessly, and with great charm, tug us away from our first, emotional responses and guide us seductively towards wiser, more patient, attitudes.\n\nThe art of living lies in knowing how, at an individual and societal level, to manage the melodramas and whims of the Faulty Walnuts through which we wonkily apprehend reality.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Censorship; Emotional Education; Emotional Scepticism; Genius; Monasteries; Philosophical Meditation; Resilience; Romantic Instinct; Transference; Wisdom.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)\n\nFOMO is the strong sense that life is elsewhere, leading to restlessness with one\u2019s condition and a sense of ingratitude towards everything one is and has.\n\nThe catalysts of FOMO are everywhere. We are continually bombarded with suggestions about what we might do (go jet skiing, study in Colorado, visit the Maldives or see the Pyramids) or where the really extraordinary parties, cities and jobs might be. The modern world makes sure we know at all times just how much we\u2019re missing. It is a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO are almost inevitable.\n\nThere are, fundamentally, two ways in which the brute facts of missing out can be viewed: one can take a Romantic or a Classical approach.\n\nTo the Romantic temperament, missing out causes agony. Somewhere else, noble, interesting and attractive people are living exactly the life that should be ours. We would be so happy if only we could be over there, at that party, with those people, or working in that agency off Washington Square, or holidaying in that shack in Jutland. Sometimes it may make us want to burst into tears.\n\nThe Romantic believes in the idea of a defined centre where the most exciting things are happening. At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin, then London. Now, it\u2019s probably San Francisco; in five years it may be Auckland or Rio.\n\nFor the Romantic, humanity is divided into a large group of the mediocre and a tribe of the elect: artists, entrepreneurs, the edgy part of the fashion world and the people doing creative things with tech. As a Romantic, it can be exhausting inside our soul. Our mother sometimes drives us to fury: her life is utterly dull. How can she accept it? Why isn\u2019t she itching to move to the Bay area? She\u2019s always suggesting we take a job in Birmingham or inviting us on walking holidays in the Lake District. Sometimes we are quite rude to her. We avoid certain people like the plague: the shy friend from school who struggles with their weight; the flatmate who is a telecoms engineer and wants to go into local politics. Being around individuals who are so unglamorous and lacking in ambition can feel fatal.\n\nFor their part, Classically minded people acknowledge that there are, of course, some genuinely marvellous things going on in the world, but they doubt that the obvious signs of glamour are a good guide to finding them. The best novel in the world, they like to think, is probably not currently winning prizes or storming up the bestseller lists. It may be being written at this moment by an arthritic woman living in the otherwise unremarkable Latvian town of Liep ja.\n\nClassical people are intensely aware that good qualities coexist with some extremely ordinary ones. Everything is jumbled up. Lamentable taste in jumpers is compatible with extraordinary insight. Academic qualifications can give no indication of true intelligence. Famous people can be dull. Obscure ones can be remarkable. At a perfect launch party, drinking sandalwood cocktails at the coolest bar in the world, one could feel sad and anxious. One might have the deepest conversations of one\u2019s life with an aunt \u2013 even though she likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dyeing her hair.\n\nThe Classical temperament also fears missing out, but has a rather different list of things they are afraid of not enjoying: getting to truly know one\u2019s parents; learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; discovering what their favourite pieces of music really mean to them; chatting to a seven-year-old child \u2026 As these wise souls know, one can indeed miss out on some extremely important things if one is always rushing to find excitement elsewhere.\n\nSee also: Classical; Domesticity; Romantic.",

We are taught to admire the minds of those infinite, baffling but astonishing geniuses such as Einstein, Tolstoy or Picasso.\n\nBut what genius might actually be is left a little vague. It is a code word for \u2018brilliant but perhaps too other-worldly ever really to fathom\u2019. We are invited to stand in awe at the achievements of geniuses but also to feel that their thought processes might be quasi-magical and that it is simply mysterious how they were able to come up with the ideas they had.\n\nBut there is a radically different view, suggested by a hugely prescient quote from the 19th-century American genius Ralph Waldo Emerson: \u2018In the minds of geniuses, we find \u2013 once more \u2013 our own neglected thoughts.\u2019\n\nWhat this tells us is that the genius doesn\u2019t have different kinds of thoughts from the rest of us. They simply take them more seriously. We ourselves will often have had our own sketchy, hesitant version of their ideas, which is why their works can make such a distinctive impression on us. What they present feels surprising and impressive, yet also obvious and right once it has been pointed out. They are giving clear and powerful articulation to notions that are already familiar because we\u2019ve been circling them ourselves, possibly for years, without being able to close in on them properly.\n\nIn this sense, genius can be defined as paying closer attention to our real thoughts and feelings and being brave and tenacious enough to hold onto them even when they find no immediate echo in the world beyond. The reason why we disavow so much of what passes through our minds is in essence anxiety. We kill off our most promising thoughts for fear of seeming strange to ourselves and others. This explains why small children are, in their own way, so much more interesting than the average adult: they have not yet become experts in what not to say or think.\n\nBut when we censor and close down, when we take fright and try not to think, is exactly the moment when the so-called genius starts to take note of what is happening within them.\n\nWe operate with a false picture of genius when we identify it too strongly with what is exotic and utterly beyond us. It is something far more provocative than this. Genius is what we all can be when we pay careful attention to what is passing through our consciousness. We all have very similar and very able minds; where geniuses differ is in their more robust inclinations to study them properly and hold on more bravely to their contents.\n\nSee also: Faulty Walnut, The; Romantic.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Getting an Early Night\n\nTo a surprising, and almost humiliating, extent some of the gravest problems we face during a day can be traced back to a brutally simple fact: that we have not had enough sleep the night before.\n\nThe idea sounds profoundly offensive. There are surely greater issues than tiredness. We are likely to be up against genuine hurdles: the economic situation, politics, problems at work, tensions in our relationship, the family \u2026\n\nThese are true difficulties. But what we often fail to appreciate is the extent to which our ability to confront them with courage and resilience is dependent on a range of distinctly \u2018small\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 factors: what our blood sugar level is like, when we last had a proper hug from someone, how much water we\u2019ve drunk \u2013 and how many hours we\u2019ve rested.\n\nWe tend to resist such analyses of our troubles. It can feel like an insult to our rational, adult dignity to think that our sense of gloom might stem from exhaustion. We would sooner identify ourselves as up against an existential crisis than see ourselves as sleep-deprived.\n\nWe should be careful of under- but also of over- intellectualising. To be happy, we require large serious things (money, freedom, love), but we need a lot of semi-insultingly little things too (a good diet, hugs, rest).\n\nAnyone who has ever looked after babies knows this well. When life becomes too much for them, it is almost always because they are tired, thirsty or hungry. With this in mind, it should be no insult to insist that we never allow ourselves to adopt a truly tragic stance until we have first investigated whether we need to have some orange juice or lie down for a while.\n\nProbably as a hangover from childhood, \u2018staying up late\u2019 feels a little glamorous and even exciting; late at night is when (in theory) the most fascinating things happen. But in a wiser culture than our own, some of the most revered people in the land would, on a regular basis, be shown taking to bed early. There would be competitions highlighting sensible bedtimes. We would be reminded of the pleasures of already being in bed when the last of the evening light still lingers in the sky. Our problems would not thereby disappear, but our strength to confront them would at points critically increase.\n\nSee also: Domesticity; Glamour; Small Pleasures; Warmth.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Glamour\n\nGlamour is the reflexive sheen afforded to people and things by the approval of the most prestigious sectors of society. What we like is not as spontaneous as we think. Our sense that something is exciting or admirable is intimately tied to the degree of glamour it is able to lay claim to. To put it another way: it is immensely hard for us to dare to like things that lack glamour.\n\nSir David Wilkie, George IV, 1829.\n\nThe novelist Sir Walter Scott was so able to imbue the kilt with glamour that King George IV had his portrait painted while wearing one.\n\nGlamour, flowing from the endorsement of high-status figures, is conveyed along the most prestigious avenues of fashion, literature and the arts. A TV series can bestow glamour on a whole region of the planet, such as the uplands of Patagonia, or on a whole era of history, such as the 1960s. The most popular novelist of the early 19th century, Sir Walter Scott, briefly made kilts glamorous; his sovereign, King George IV, even wore one in an official portrait.\n\nThings are constantly gaining or losing glamour. Many not especially helpful things can end up glamorous: founding a tech company, being very slim, being very angry, always saying what you think immediately, family skiing holidays \u2026 And many very helpful things are not glamorous at all: small gestures of kindness, learning poems by heart, coping with having the wrong sort of nose, being polite, doing the laundry \u2026 The lack of glamour makes it harder for us to get enthusiastic about these moves or devote ourselves to them with a modicum of grace.\n\nRather than reject glamour, the priority is to redirect it more accurately. In the Utopia, the following things would be glamorous: forgiveness, depressive realism, the acceptance of imperfection, humility and gratitude. In other words, glamour would support, rather than undermine, the pursuit of a good life.\n\nFortunately, it has always been possible to raise the esteem of hitherto disregarded things. With effort, the light of glamour can be redirected. Even an examined life might, one day, be artfully rendered glamorous.\n\nSee also: Advertising; Domesticity; Getting an Early Night; Normality; Seduction; Wisdom.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Good Brands\n\nThe word \u2018brand\u2019 brings with it disturbing associations: heartless commercialism, crushing uniformity, blandness, a dumbed-down experience. A brand can be seen as a cynical way of cashing in on what might once have been a good idea by stripping away whatever was originally quirky, authentic and brave and churning out a standardised product. It is the corporate antithesis of art. When anyone sells out, it\u2019s a brand that buys their soul.\n\nThere are plenty of bad brands around, so it\u2019s understandable that blame gets attached to the underlying notion of the brand itself. It becomes tempting to suppose that, ideally, we would live in an unbranded world. In fact, the idea of a brand is a really significant one. A good economy needs good brands.\n\nEssentially, a brand is a constellation of qualities; it is a personality in the material realm. It presents a vision of life in a hugely condensed manner. But a brand doesn\u2019t only symbolise a set of ideas. It makes these ideas reproducible and universal. Brands allow particular qualities to multiply across the world. We tend to be alive to the negative possibilities, but the true culprit is never the pure idea of repetition. What we tend really to be objecting to is what is being repeated.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Italian architect Andrea Palladio worked out some basic designs for villas, churches and public buildings in the Classical style. He built the first version in the little town of Vicenza. But his ideas spread; they were branded and universalised. Over the centuries, they were taken up in France, the UK, Poland, Russia and especially in the US. Thomas Jefferson in particular bought into the Palladian brand: his own house, Monticello, and the University of Virginia are key examples of franchise architecture, just as much as is the design for a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. The key issue isn\u2019t free creativity versus the cold hand of the brand. Rather, it\u2019s between the good, noble brand (like Palladio) and the less impressive versions that tend to be much more familiar.\n\nBrands invite the recognition that great things are rarely done by individuals acting in heroic isolation. At some point, every good idea, every important insight should go through the process of becoming a brand, so as to widen its power. The world is in great need of better brands.\n\nSee also: Good Business; Good Demand; Good Materialism.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Good Demand\n\nThe sort of work that is available to us and the societies we live in are largely the result of an issue that is humblingly small and close to home: what we decide to spend our money on. The combined purchasing choices of millions of people profoundly shape the nature of employment, the structure of remuneration and the distribution of prestige. The term \u2018consumer\u2019 capitalism acknowledges that we live in economies substantially defined by what we want to buy.\n\nGovernments are used to carefully tracking demand, and panic at signs of its decline. When there is a sharp shortfall, they will move to stimulate consumption so as to ward off dire consequences for employment, tax revenue and investment confidence.\n\nBut we should note the extent to which government focus is always on the quantity of demand, not its quality. It is considered more or less irrelevant what people are spending money on, so long as they are spending. They might be buying doughnuts or taking French conversation classes, seeing a psychotherapist or purchasing sports cars. In terms of GDP, unemployment and the stock market, the nature of demand doesn\u2019t matter, so long as the total spend is high.\n\nYet, in other ways, it matters immensely what we spend our money on, because what we buy determines what kinds of lives we will end up leading and, most importantly, what sorts of jobs there will be; whether they will be degrading or noble, useful to others or noxious. This is where a major statement of value can come in: there is better and worse demand. Demand for guns is less \u2018good\u2019 than demand for education. Demand for healthy food is better than demand for its junk alternative. Good Demand might be defined as an aggregate of consumer choices in line with a generous, fruitful understanding of higher human needs.\n\nGood Demand has been elusive because it is so hard for us to identify our higher needs. We are prone to grasping at whatever is blinking most intensely and attractively at us. We are creatures of the herd and will buy what others are buying. We are also surrounded by a hugely active industry that artfully encourages us to want things for its benefit rather than our own. Advertising is founded on our inability to hold on to an accurate picture of our true needs.\n\nOur failures mean that, individually, we may not get the happiness we seek. Collectively, we will end up with a profoundly dysfunctional economy. Raising the quality of demand doesn\u2019t imply a draconian government imposing a high-minded agenda on a reluctant public. In a market-oriented democratic society, change can only ever be voluntary. Altering demand can\u2019t be a matter of forcing anyone to do anything. What we need is the more important, more humane, task of encouraging ourselves to live up to our own highest aspirations in our purchasing choices. The result will be nobler kinds of profit, and fewer dissatisfied and meaning-poor working lives.\n\nSee also: Advertising; Emotional Capitalism; Good Brands; Good Business; Good Materialism; Higher Needs; Misemployment; Utopia.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Good Enough\n\nThe mid-20th-century English psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott, who specialised in working with parents and children, was disturbed by how often he encountered in his consulting rooms parents who were deeply disappointed with themselves. They felt they were failing as parents and hated themselves intensely as a result. They were ashamed of their occasional rows, their bursts of short temper, their times of boredom around their own children and their many mistakes. They were haunted by a range of anxious questions: are we too strict, too lenient, too protective, not protective enough? What struck Winnicott, however, was that these people were almost always not at all bad parents. They were loving, often very kind, and very interested in their children; they tried hard to meet their needs and to understand their problems as best they could. As parents they were \u2013 as he came to put it in a hugely memorable and important phrase \u2013 \u2018good enough\u2019.\n\nWinnicott identified a crucial issue. We often torment ourselves because we have in our minds a very demanding, and in fact impossible, vision of what we\u2019re supposed to be like across a range of areas of our lives. This vision doesn\u2019t emerge from a careful study of what actual people are like; it\u2019s a fantasy, a punitive perfectionism, drawn from the cultural ether.\n\nWhen it comes to parenting, we imagine a fantasy of parents who are always calm, always perfectly wise, always there when their child needs them. There are no parents like this. But a Romantic conception of the perfect parent can fill our minds and make us deeply anxious and fretful, because our own family life inevitably looks so messy and muddled by comparison. Astonishingly and unreasonably inflated expectations leave us only able to perceive where we have fallen short.\n\nWith the phrase \u2018good enough\u2019, Winnicott was initiating a hugely important project. He wanted to move us away from idealisation. Ideals may sound nice, but they bring a terrible problem in their wake: they can make us despair of the merely quite good things we already do and have. \u2018Good enough\u2019 is a cure for the sickness of idealisation.\n\nWinnicott introduced the idea of \u2018good enough\u2019 around parenting. But it applies widely across our lives, because we idealise around a great many different things. For example, we might refer to the \u2018good enough\u2019 job. It may not meet our fantasy demands: creative yet secure; fascinating yet unstressful; morally uplifting yet highly paid. But by the standards of what real jobs are like, it might be OK and worth taking pride in. Or we could speak of the \u2018good enough\u2019 marriage. It might not be the perfect union of two souls, sex may be intermittent, there may be regular frustrations and misunderstandings and a fair number of flare-ups. But by the standards of actual long-term relationships, that might be genuine success.\n\nBy dialling down our expectations, the idea of \u2018good enough\u2019 resensitises us to the lesser, but very real, virtues we already possess, but that our unreal hopes have made us overlook.\n\nA \u2018good enough\u2019 life is not a bad life. It\u2019s the best existence that actual humans are ever likely to lead.\n\nSee also: Domesticity; Expectations; Jolliness; Normality; Perfectionism; Procrastination; Splitting and Integration; Wisdom; Work/Life Balance.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Good Materialism\n\nWhen people seek to pinpoint the root cause of corruption in our age, they generally need only to point to our attachment to material things. We are sick because we are so profoundly materialistic.\n\nIt can seem as if we\u2019re faced with a stark choice: to be materialistic \u2013 obsessed with money and possessions, shallow and selfish \u2013 or to reject materialism, be good and focus on more important matters of the spirit.\n\nMost of us are stuck somewhere between these two choices. We are still enmeshed in the desire to possess while hating ourselves for being so.\n\nCrucially, it\u2019s not actually materialism \u2013 the pure fact of buying things and getting excited by possessions \u2013 that is really the problem. We\u2019re failing to make a clear distinction between good and bad versions of materialism.\n\nLet\u2019s try to understand good materialism through a slightly unusual route: religion. Because we see religions as focused exclusively on spiritual things, it can be surprising to note how much use they have made of material things. They have spent a lot time making and thinking about shrines, temples, monasteries, art works, scrolls to hang in houses, clothes and ceremonies.\n\nHowever, they have wanted material things to serve the highest and noblest purpose: the development of our souls. It is just that they have recognised that we are incarnate, sensory, bodily beings, and that the way to get through to our souls must be through our bodies rather than merely through the intellect.\n\nFor centuries, the importance of material things was at the core of Christianity, which proposed that Jesus was both the highest spiritual being, and a flesh and blood person. He was the spirit incarnate; holiness embodied.\n\nIn the Catholic Mass, great significance is accorded to bread and wine, which are believed to be transubstantiations of Christ: that is, material objects that simultaneously have a spiritual identity, just as Jesus himself combined the spiritual and the bodily while on earth.\n\nThis can sound like an arcane point entirely removed from the local shopping mall, but exactly the same concept applies outside of religions. Many good material possessions can be said to involve a kind of \u2018transubstantiation\u2019, whereby they are both practical and physical and also embody or allude to a positive personality or spirit.\n\nOne can imagine a handsome wooden chair that \u2018tran-substantiates\u2019 a set of important values: straightforwardness, strength, honesty and elegance. By getting closer to the chair, we could become a little more like it.\n\nMaterial objects can be said to play a positive psychological (or spiritual) role in our lives when higher, more positive, ideals are \u2018materialised\u2019 in them. Therefore, buying them and using them daily gives us a chance to get closer to our better selves. When they are contained in physical things, valuable psychological qualities that are otherwise often intermittent in our thoughts and conduct can become more stable and resilient.\n\nThis is not to say that all consumerism is unproblematic; it depends on what a given material object stands for. An object can transubstantiate the very worst sides of human nature \u2013 greed, callousness, the desire to triumph \u2013 as much as it can the best. So we must be careful not to decry or celebrate all material consumption: we have to ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by making, are those that lend encouragement to the best sides of our natures.\n\nSee also: Emotional Capitalism; Fashion; Good Brands; Good Business; Good Demand; Home.",

But the desire to feel proud of one\u2019s community is a natural and noble impulse. We just need sophisticated ways of directing our urge for pride.\n\nCollective pride is important because there is never enough to be proud of in a single life. Nationalism takes the pressure off us to be individually accomplished and admirable. It lightens the oppressive responsibility we might otherwise feel to ensure that our own lives could always be stellar and heroic; that\u2019s why patriotism often appeals to those who have the narrowest opportunities.\n\nIn an ideal, utopian society, nationalism would be a powerful sentiment, but it would be focused on things that don\u2019t normally figure in national anthems or patriotic speeches. In the future, the nationalist might love their country for things such as: the general elegance and harmony of cities; the way you don\u2019t have to be rich to live in a gracious neighbourhood; the low divorce rate brought about not by sullen resignation but because of the collective investment in the stages leading up to marriage, and the sophisticated support provided by the state when things get tricky in families. People would be proud that, in their nation, they consume a lot of elderflower cordial rather than alcohol; have a public honours system that rewards displays of wisdom; that the richest person in the country is a psychoanalyst; and that they have a global reputation for being tactful.\n\nWhat we worry about isn\u2019t, in truth, pride in a country but vanity about things that aren\u2019t truly admirable. The solution to nationalism isn\u2019t to abolish it (which isn\u2019t viable anyway), but to create in a society things in which wise people could rightly take pride.\n\nSee also: Saints; State Broadcasting.",

But if we analyse economic activity, we find that the overwhelming proportion of it lies clustered around the satisfaction of our lower needs. The large enterprises focus nearly exclusively on catering to such needs as those for transport and nutrition, housing and heating, communication and logistics. Meanwhile, our higher needs lie in a pre-industrial disorganised condition, in the hands of gurus and inspirational teachers, outside the mechanisms and useful disciplines of the market.\n\nThis presents a vast economic opportunity for the future. We will in time learn to commercialise all our more complicated needs, which will result in a more honourable and meaningful form of capitalism. Although it might look as if the economy as it stands is well developed, when measured against our real requirements for happiness, we have barely scratched the surface, and an enormous expansion of capitalism is at hand. We plainly need not only food and shelter but, among many other things, to live in beautiful cities; to have good advice and psychological support; to manage our emotions; to sustain strong families across generations; to cultivate our minds; to be wise, kind and self-possessed; and to be the recipients of news and entertainment that are reliably well targeted to our requirements for inner growth and dignity.\n\nEach of these presents immense targets for the businesses of the future to aim for. The fact that these needs don\u2019t look the same as those that led to the construction of highways or pipelines doesn\u2019t make them illegitimate or unviable. It is no corruption of higher needs to ask that commerce begins to address them; rather, it is an attempt to make capitalism as meaningful as it can be.\n\nSee also: Advertising; Emotional Capitalism; Good Business; Good Demand; Misemployment.",

We feel we are living in terrible times.\n\nBut \u2018terrible\u2019 in comparison to what? The media constantly invites us to view how things are today against a very narrow slice of time. Things feels worse than they were yesterday or last week or two years ago, before the most recent atrocity, economic downturn or security crisis.\n\nBy contrast, what we call History offers us a much bigger, fairer and more consoling comparison across large slices of time. It frames what is happening now against the perspective of how things normally tend to go over decades and centuries.\n\nIt teaches us some usefully dark lessons. We learn that societies are almost never very admirable; there are always crises; economies pretty much always fluctuate; manners and morals are always shifting and in some ways getting worse; almost no human communities have ever been remarkably just or equal; progressive moments never quite achieve what was hoped of them and are almost always followed by periods of reaction.\n\nNevertheless, History also reminds us that things have seemed close to outright collapse many times before but that eventually humanity has more or less pulled through. The Roman Empire was governed for many years by a string of horrendous emperors such as Nero and Caligula. But this didn\u2019t signal the end of everything, although sometimes it must have seemed as if it would. The chaotic years were followed a bit later by a succession of able and honourable governments (including that of the philosopher Marcus Aurelius) and long periods of civilised prosperity. The troubles of our own times are \u2013 much more than we tend to suppose \u2013 at once very normal and much less fatal than we are inclined to imagine.\n\nLudolf Bakhuizen, Warships in a Heavy Storm, c. 1695.\n\nLike this ship weathering rough seas, civilisations almost always survive turbulent times.\n\nA society at any time can be likened to a ship in a storm. A striking thing about the painting by the 17th-century Dutch artist Ludolf Bakhuizen is that it doesn\u2019t show a ship sinking. It is a painting of a ship managing to hold its own in frightening circumstances that it has been adroitly designed to withstand. It\u2019s a distinction we easily miss. To a sailor on a first voyage, it would, understandably, have felt as if violent death were imminent. But as the older crew would know, the ships of the Dutch navy had survived many far worse storms already.\n\nIn effect, the news is always trying to place us in the position of the first-time voyager. It is always stoking our natural panic for its own commercial ends (there is no money to be made from reassuring audiences that things will be OK). By contrast, History is like the person who has been on the seas for many years and can therefore compare any one storm with many others.\n\nHistory is an artificial, laboriously constructed, beautiful corrective to the natural short-term perspectives of our timid and alarmed minds.\n\nSee also: News.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 History is Now\n\nIt can be hard to imagine how we might change the status quo. Much that is around us conspires to give off a sense of fixity. We are surrounded by institutions and habits that have lasted for centuries. We trust that the human beings who came before us have fully mapped the range of the possible. If something hasn\u2019t happened, it\u2019s either because it can\u2019t happen or it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nWhen we study History, however, the picture changes sharply. Once time is speeded up and we climb up a mountain of minutes to survey the centuries, change appears constant. New continents are discovered; alternative ways of governing nations are pioneered; ideas of how to dress and whom to worship are transformed. Once people wore strange cloaks and tilled the land with clumsy instruments. A long time ago, they chopped a king\u2019s head off. Way back, people got around in fragile ships, ate the eyeballs of sheep, used chamber pots and didn\u2019t know how to fix teeth.\n\nWe come away from all this knowing, in theory at least, that things do change. However, in practice, and almost without noticing, we tend to distance ourselves and our own societies from a day-to-day belief that we belong to the same ongoing turbulent narrative and are, at present, its central actors. History, we feel, is what used to happen; it can\u2019t really be what is happening around us in the here and now. In our vicinity at least, things have settled down.\n\nTo attenuate this insensitivity to the omnipresence of change and, by extension, the passivity it breeds, we might turn to some striking lines in T.S. Eliot\u2019s cycle of poems, Four Quartets (1943):\n\nSo, while the light fails\n\nOn a winter\u2019s afternoon, in a secluded chapel\n\nHistory is now and England.\n\nWinter afternoons, around 4pm, have a habit of feeling particularly resolved and established, especially in quiet English country chapels, many of which date back to the Middle Ages. Hence the surprise of Eliot\u2019s third line, his resonant: \u2018History is now and England\u2019. In other words, everything that we associate with history \u2013 the impetuous daring of great people, the dramatic alterations in values, the revolutionary questioning of long-held beliefs, the upturning of the old order \u2013 is still going on, even at this very moment, in outwardly peaceful, apparently unchanging places like the countryside near Shamley Green in Surrey, where Eliot wrote the poem. We don\u2019t see it only because we are standing far too close to it. The world is being made and remade at every instant. Any one of us has a theoretical chance of being an agent in history, on a big or small scale. It is open to our own times to build a new city as beautiful as Venice, to change ideas as radically as the Renaissance, to start an intellectual movement as resounding as Buddhism.\n\nThe present has all the contingency of the past \u2013 and is every bit as malleable. It should not intimidate us. How we love, travel, approach the arts, govern, educate ourselves, run businesses, age and die are all up for further development. Current views may appear firm, but only because we exaggerate their fixity. The majority of what exists is arbitrary, neither inevitable nor right, simply the result of muddle and happenstance. We should be confident, even at sunset on winter afternoons, of our power to join the stream of history \u2013 and, however modestly, change its course.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Home\n\nOne of the most meaningful activities we are ever engaged in is the creation of a home. Over a number of years, typically with a lot of thought and considerable dedication, we assemble furniture, crockery, pictures, rugs, cushions, vases, sideboards, taps, door handles and so on into a distinctive constellation that we anoint with the word \u2018home\u2019. As we create our rooms, we engage passionately with culture in a way we seldom do in the supposedly higher realms of museums or galleries. We reflect profoundly on the atmosphere of a picture; we ponder the relationship between colours on a wall; we notice how consequential the angle of the back of a sofa can be, and ask carefully what books truly deserve our ongoing attention.\n\nOur homes will not necessarily be the most attractive or sumptuous environments we could spend time in. There are always hotels or public spaces that would be a good deal more impressive. But after we have been travelling a long while, after too many nights in hotel rooms or in the spare rooms of friends, we typically feel a powerful ache to return to our own furnishings \u2013 an ache that has little to do with material comfort per se. We need to get home to remember who we are.\n\nCreating a home is frequently such a demanding process because it requires us to find our way to objects that can correctly convey our identities. We may have to go to enormous efforts to track down what we deem to be the \u2018right\u2019 objects for particular functions, rejecting hundreds of alternatives that would, in a material sense, have been perfectly serviceable, in the name of those we believe can faithfully communicate the right messages about who we are.\n\nWe get fussy because objects are, in their own ways, hugely eloquent. Two chairs that perform much the same physical role can articulate entirely different visions of life. An object feels \u2018right\u2019 when it speaks attractively about qualities that we are drawn to, but don\u2019t possess strong enough doses of in our day-to-day lives. The desirable object gives us a more secure hold on values that are present yet fragile in ourselves; it endorses and encourages important themes in us. The smallest things in our homes whisper to us; they offer us encouragement, reminders, consoling thoughts, warnings or correctives, as we make breakfast or do the accounts in the evening.\n\nThe quest to build a home is connected with a need to stabilise and organise our complex selves. It\u2019s not enough to know who we are in our own minds. We need something more tangible, material and sensuous to pin down the diverse and intermittent aspects of our identities. We need to rely on certain kinds of cutlery, bookshelves, laundry cupboards and armchairs to align us with who we are and seek to be. We are not vaunting ourselves; we\u2019re trying to gather our identities in one receptacle, preserving ourselves from erosion and dispersal. Home means the place where our soul feels that it has found its proper physical container, where, every day, the objects we live among quietly remind us of our most authentic commitments and loves.\n\nSee also: Architecture; Good Materialism.",

We leave the possibility of success to others, because we don\u2019t seem to ourselves to be anything like the sort of people we see lauded around us.\n\nThe root cause of Impostor Syndrome is a hugely unhelpful picture of what other people are really like. We feel like impostors not because we are uniquely flawed, but because we fail to imagine how deeply flawed everyone else is beneath a more or less polished surface.\n\nThe Impostor Syndrome has its roots in a basic feature of the human condition. We know ourselves from the inside, but others only from the outside. We are aware of all our anxieties, doubts and idiocies from within. Yet all we know of others is what they happen to do and tell us \u2013 a far narrower and more edited source of information.\n\nThe solution to Impostor Syndrome lies in making a crucial leap of faith: that, despite a lack of reliable evidence, everyone else must be as anxious, uncertain and wayward as we are. The leap means that whenever we encounter a stranger, we are not really encountering a stranger, we are encountering someone who is \u2013 despite the surface evidence to the contrary \u2013 very much like us. Therefore, nothing fundamental stands between us and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfilment.\n\nSee also: Psychological Asymmetry.",

The beautiful person glimpsed briefly in the street as we step off the bus; the city visited for a few days on holiday; the job we read about in a few tantalising paragraphs of a magazine \u2013 these have unwise tendencies to seem immediately and definitively superior to our current partner, our long-established home and our committed workplace and can inspire us to sudden and sometimes regrettable divorces, relocations and resignations.\n\nWhen we spot apparent perfection, we tend to blame our spectacular bad luck for the mediocrity of our lives, without realising that we are mistaking an asymmetry of knowledge for an asymmetry of quality; we are failing to see not that our partner, home and job are especially awful, but that we know them especially well.\n\nIncumbents are the victims of disproportionate knowledge. They are generally no worse than anyone or anything else, but as they are familiar, their every failing has had a chance to be minutely charted.\n\nThe corrective to disproportionate knowledge is experience. We need to mine the secret reality of other people and places and so learn that, beneath their charms, they will almost invariably be essentially \u2018normal\u2019 in nature: that is, no worse yet no better than the incumbents we already understand.\n\nThe solution to the Incumbent Problem is to extrapolate from what we already know and apply it to what we don\u2019t yet know. The most plausible generalisation we can make about unknown things is that they are likely to be closer to what we\u2019ve already experienced than they are to being completely and bountifully different.\n\nWe should beware of the injustices we unthinkingly visit upon all the incumbent features of, and relationships in, our lives.\n\nSee also: Crushes; Cure for Unrequited Love.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Infidelity\n\nInfidelity is commonly interpreted as close to the greatest tragedy that could befall any relationship, and as the natural, inevitable prelude to the break-up of a union.\n\nIt is viewed in such dark terms because, under the philosophy of Romanticism, which has dominated our understanding of love since the middle of the 18th century, sex is understood to be not principally a physical act but the summation and central symbol of love. Before Romanticism, people had sex and fell in love, but they did not always see these two acts as inextricably linked: one might love someone and not sleep with them, or sleep with them and not love them. It was this dislocation that Romanticism refused to countenance. Sex was simply the crowning moment of love, the superlative way of expressing one\u2019s devotion to someone, the ultimate proof of one\u2019s sincerity.\n\nWhat this philosophy unwittingly accomplished was to turn infidelity from a problem into a catastrophe. Never again could sex be viewed as being divorced from intense emotion and a profound desire for commitment. It was no longer possible to say that sex meant \u2018nothing\u2019, in the sense of being a joyful, kind but emotionally empty act devoid of any desire to care for or live with a new person in the long term and in no way indicative of any drop in affection for the established partner.\n\nThere are, of course, many cases where infidelity means exactly what Romanticism takes it to mean: contempt for one\u2019s relationship. But in many other cases, it may mean something rather different: a passing, surface desire for erotic excitement that coexists with an ongoing, sincere commitment to one\u2019s life partner.\n\nOur culture makes this thought close to impossible, so \u2018getting over\u2019 an infidelity \u2013 by which is meant, learning to see that the unfaithful act might not mean what Romanticism tells us it means \u2013 has become a challenge of heroic proportions and, most of the time, a brute impossibility. However much an unfaithful partner may patiently explain that it meant nothing, the idea seems entirely implausible. How could sex, the summation of love, ever mean anything less than pretty much everything?\n\nThere may be one potential way out of the impasse: a frank examination of the recesses of one\u2019s own mind and, perhaps, an honest recall of certain moments of past personal experience. What this brave investigation is likely to throw up is evidence that one is strangely capable of something rather surprising: caring deeply for someone and yet entertaining, or masterminding, a sexual scenario involving somebody else. However much the thought seems unbelievable when we hear it from the mouth of a straying partner, in some ways it seems quite possible to think of screwing one person and loving another.\n\nThe best way to recover after an infidelity may therefore be to ignore what Romanticism tells us that infidelity has to mean, and to consult a more reliable source of information: what we ourselves took infidelity to mean the last time the idea crossed through our minds or our lives. It is on this basis that we may \u2013 with considerable pain, of course \u2013 come to be able to forgive and even in a way understand and accept the apologies of a repentant partner. It is on the basis of subjective experience of unfaithful thoughts that we may redemptively enrich, complicate and soften what happens when we end up as their victims.\n\nSee also: Secrets in Love; Sex and Love.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Inner Idiot, The\n\nThe \u2018Inner Idiot\u2019 is a bracing term used to describe a substantial, hugely influential and strenuously concealed part of everyone. An Idiot is what we deeply fear being; it is what we suspect in our darkest hours that we might be; and it is what we should simply accept, with humour and good grace, that we often truly are. A decent life isn\u2019t one in which we foolishly believe we can slay or evade the Inner Idiot; it\u2019s one in which we practise the only art available to us: sensible cohabitation.\n\nThe Inner Idiot makes itself felt at moments small and large. The Idiot is clumsy: it forgets names, loses important documents, spills food down its front and gets air kisses wrong. It speaks out of turn, thrusts itself forward at inopportune moments, both babbles and blushes. The Idiot is prickly, it gets into a rage because it was momentarily ignored, it sees plots against it where there was only accident, it shouts when a drawer won\u2019t open properly and is immediately self-righteous when faced with the most minor criticism. It is, for the Idiot, always someone else\u2019s fault. The Inner Idiot is a child on a bad day.\n\nWe know our own Inner Idiot from the inside and might suppose it is unique to us. In fact, it represents what might be called the \u2018lower\u2019 self of all of humanity. It is only residual good manners that has made the Inner Idiot of others less obvious to us \u2013 and hence made our own seem like a freakish exception.\n\nMuch of wisdom consists in accepting that the Inner Idiot will never go away and that we should therefore endeavour to form a good working relationship with it.\n\nTrying to prevent the emergence of the Inner Idiot otherwise inspires a range of unfortunate traits. For example, we may lose confidence and grow unnecessarily meek and cautious in a bid to appear dignified and serious in front of others. We may refuse ever to ask someone for a date or for a pay rise; we might never go travelling on our own or give a speech in public, as all of these moves require a calculated risk of being hijacked by the Idiot.\n\nBy denying our Idiot, we may grow unfeasibly pompous and stiff. Nothing makes us seem absurd faster than insisting on our own seriousness. We are always better off confessing to idiocy in good time, rather than letting it emerge from behind our carefully constructed pretensions.\n\nIn relationships, there can be no greater generosity than to tell a partner, early on, what our Inner Idiot is like, to give them a road map to its antics, and to apologise promptly and warmly when it has overwhelmed us. None of us should try to find a partner who lacks an Inner Idiot (it\u2019s impossible); we should just find out more about the particular kind of Idiot they have. In a wiser world, an entirely standard and wholly inoffensive question on an early dinner date would be: \u2018And what is your Inner Idiot like?\u2019\n\nBy squaring up to the existence of the Inner Idiot, we may come to feel a useful compassion for ourselves. Of course we made a mess of certain things; of course we made some bad decisions; of course we said the wrong things. What else could we have done, given that we are hosting a powerfully idiotic being in our minds and that our rational cleverness and goodness sit precariously on top of its many deeply unintelligent impulses?\n\nWe may spread our compassion to others as well. They were not necessarily evil when they hurt us; they merely possess a domineering Idiot of their own.\n\nThe best school for learning about the Inner Idiot is comedy. The essence of comedy is to expose the workings of the Idiot in a way that invites sympathetic laughter rather than harsh criticism. The stand-up artist is a sage who knows how to redescribe their Idiot with accurate benevolence, and teaches us to do the same.\n\nLove is another solution to the problems of the Inner Idiot. In its most mature and desired sense, love means encountering and embracing the Idiot of another, regarding it not with horror or as an affront, but with all the imagination and generosity with which a parent might look upon their beloved red-faced two-year-old in a tantrum.\n\nIt\u2019s not very nice that we have an Inner Idiot. In fact, it\u2019s an immense inconvenience. But we cannot wish the issue away. A wise society would be ambitious about understanding, accommodating and forgiving the Inner Idiot in everyone, and would be devoted to finding ways to soothe it and limit its influence. In the Utopia, there would be classes in schools and headline government policies focused entirely on helping us admit \u2013 without too much shame \u2013 the presence of our and others\u2019 Inner Idiots and then instructing us with patient determination how to work around their flaws as best we can.\n\nIt is one of the greatest of all human achievements when we can finally move from seeing someone as an \u2018Idiot\u2019 to being able to consider them as that far less offensive and more morally hybrid creature: a \u2018Loveable Idiot\u2019.\n\nSee also: Clumsiness; Confidence; Normality; Other-as-Child; Universal Love; Vulnerability.",

Sometimes they are kind, but often they are punitive, telling us we\u2019re stupid or worthless or that we deserve every misfortune that comes our way.\n\nAn Inner Voice was always once an outer voice that we have imperceptibly made our own. Perhaps we have absorbed the tone of a harassed or angry parent; the menacing threats of an elder sibling keen to put us down; the contempt of a schoolyard bully, or the words of a teacher who seemed impossible to please. We take in these voices because, at certain key moments in the past, they sounded compelling and irresistible. The dominant figures of our individual histories repeated their messages over and over until they became lodged in our own way of thinking \u2013 sometimes to our great cost.\n\nThe ideal Inner Voice doesn\u2019t pretend that everything we do is wonderful. Rather, it is like the voice of an ideal friend. These figures can recognise when we have done something unwise, but they are merciful, fair, accurate in understanding what\u2019s going on and interested in helping us deal with our problems. It\u2019s not that we should stop judging ourselves; the hope is that we can learn to be better judges of ourselves.\n\nInstead of promoting a self-flagellating critical internal commentary, a good friend represents a calm, constructive way of addressing failings.\n\nCulture has a role to play here. If our surrounding culture is broadcasting voices that are at once realistic and supportive, complex and morally perceptive, it will be much easier for us to adopt this manner internally as we comment on the trickier parts of our own lives. External generous wisdom can take up residence in the place it is most needed: our private running conversation with ourselves.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Clumsiness; Emotional Intelligence; Self-Sabotage; Tragedy; Transitional Object.",

It may be that the job is difficult to attain, it may require long years of preparation, or it might be in an industry that has become precarious and therefore denies us good long-term prospects.\n\nWe call it a fixation \u2013 rather than simply an interest \u2013 to signal that the focus on the job is problematic because we have an overwhelming sense that our future lies with this one occupation and this occupation alone, while facing a major obstacle in turning our idea into a reality.

However, with its remorseless and insistent upbeat quality, it has little in common with what is really required for a well-lived life.\n\nNormality includes a lot of sorrows. Many genuinely sad things occur in every existence, pretty much every day. In the background of most of our lives, there is likely to be a powerful sadness. It\u2019s natural to want to skirt contact with it, but such avoidance comes at a high price. Honesty about the darkness inside ourselves and the strangeness and cruelty of life more generally are crucial components in engaging with our own ambitions and achieving intimacy with others.\n\nIn a discussion of parenting styles, the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott once identified a particularly problematic kind of child carer: the person who wants to \u2018jolly\u2019 babies and small children along, always picking them up with cheer, bouncing them up and down and pulling exaggerated funny faces, perhaps shouting \u2018peekaboo\u2019 repeatedly.

Yet Winnicott was worried by what effect this would have on a child \u2013 the way it was subtly not giving the child a chance to acknowledge its own sadness, or more broadly, its own feelings.\n\nThe jollier doesn\u2019t just want the child to be happy; more alarmingly, it can\u2019t tolerate the idea that it might be sad, so unexplored and potentially overwhelming are his or her own background feelings of disappointment and grief.\n\nChildhood is necessarily full of sadness (as is adulthood), insisted Winnicott, and we must perpetually be granted the possibility of periods of mourning: for a broken toy, the grey sky on a Sunday afternoon, or the lingering sadness we can see in our parents\u2019 eyes.\n\nWe need a public culture that remembers how much of life deserves to have solemn and mournful moments and that isn\u2019t tempted \u2013 normally in the name of selling us things \u2013 aggressively to deny the legitimate place of melancholy.\n\nSee also: Artistic Consolation; Cheerful Despair; Consolation; Crying with Art; Good Enough; Kintsugi; Melancholy; Normality; Sentimentality; Unprocessed Emotion; Vulnerability.",

Distraught, he sent it to be repaired in China. On its return, he was horrified by the ugly metal staples that had been used to join the broken pieces, and charged his craftsmen with devising a more appropriate solution. What they came up with was a method that didn\u2019t disguise the damage, but made something honestly artful out of it.\n\nKintsugi belongs to the Zen ideals of wabi-sabi, which cherishes what is simple, unpretentious and aged \u2013 especially if it has a rustic or weathered quality. A story is told of one of the great proponents of wabi-sabi, Sen no Riky (1522\u20131599). On a journey through southern Japan, he was invited to a dinner by a host who thought he would be impressed by an elaborate and expensive antique tea jar that he had bought from China. But Riky didn\u2019t even seem to notice this item and instead spent his time chatting and admiring a branch swaying in the breeze outside. In despair at this lack of interest, once Riky had left, the devastated host smashed the jar to pieces and retired to his room. But the other guests more wisely gathered the fragments and stuck them together through kintsugi. When Riky next came to visit, the philosopher turned to the repaired jar and, with a knowing smile, exclaimed: \u2018Now it is magnificent\u2019.\n\nTea bowl, porcelain with gold lacquer repairs, early 17th century.\n\nThe aesthetic of Kintsugi lends reverence to the damaged and imperfect \u2013 a principle we could usefully employ in our own lives.\n\nIn an age that worships youth, perfection and the new, the art of kintsugi retains a particular wisdom \u2013 as applicable to our own lives as to a broken teacup. The care and love expended on the shattered pots should lend us the confidence to respect what is damaged and scarred, vulnerable and imperfect \u2013 starting with ourselves and those around us.\n\nSee also: Appreciation; Jolliness; Love as Generosity; Splitting and Integration.",

But good listening doesn\u2019t just involve paying attention to what someone is saying. There\u2019s a far more active side to the listening process that could properly be described as \u2018editing\u2019; in key ways, it is similar to the work done for an author by an ideal literary editor.\n\nClassically, a good editor doesn\u2019t merely accept a manuscript as it is first presented. They set about interrogating, cutting, expanding and focusing the text \u2013 not in the name of changing the fundamentals of what the author is saying, but of bringing out a range of underlying intentions that have been threatened by digressions, hesitations, losses of confidence and lapses of attention. The editor doesn\u2019t change the author into someone else; they help them to become who they really are.\n\nThe same process is at work with a good listener. They too know that some of what a speaker is saying doesn\u2019t accurately reflect what they truly mean. Perhaps they want to touch on a sensitive, sad point, but are frightened of being too heavy or of imposing. Maybe the speaker wants to pin down why something was beautiful or exciting, but get bogged down in details, repetitions or subplots. There might be an emotional truth they are trying to express, but the quality of their insight is undermined by the feeling that it would be more normal and safer to stick to factual details.\n\nA good editorially minded listener knows how gently to correct these tendencies. They will in the kindest way possible ask the speaker to unpack their feelings more intensely and elaborate upon emotions with a sense that these will prove hugely interesting rather than boring or alarming to the audience. They help the speaker to close down stray subplots, and nudge them back to the central story, which has been lost in details. When the speaker gets tongue-tied from fear, the good editor-listener is on hand with reassurance and encouragement. They know how to signal an open mind and hint at a welcome berth for all manner of unusual-sounding but important confessions.\n\nThe good editor-listener will be responsible for a lot of changes in a conversation. Were it to be transcribed and manually edited, there would be red pencil marks everywhere across the text. But the result of such deft interventions is never a sense of violation, but an impression of having been brought closer to one\u2019s real intentions.\n\nAn ideal editor-listener helps us to be more ourselves than we know how to be by ourselves.\n\nSee also: Love as Generosity; Warmth.",

This fact is heavily denied by Romantic culture, which promises us that there are in fact a few people who will be able to understand us fully \u2013 a fairy tale that causes us untold difficulty.\n\nA high degree of loneliness is an inexorable part of being a sensitive, intelligent human. It is a built-in feature of a complex existence. We must all die alone, which really means that our pain is for us alone to endure. Others can throw us words of encouragement, but in every life we are out on the ocean drowning in the swell while others, even the nice ones, stand on the shore, waving good-naturedly.\n\nIt is unlikely that we will ever find someone on exactly the same page of the soul as us: we will long for utter congruity, but there will be constant dissonance because we appeared on the earth at different times, are the product of different experiences, and are not made of quite the same fabric.\n\nThe problem is sure to get worse the more thoughtful and perceptive we are. There will simply be fewer people like us around. Acute loneliness is a specially punitive tax we have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind.\n\nAt an exasperated moment, near the end of his life, the German writer Goethe, who appeared to have had a lot of friends, exploded bitterly: \u2018No one has ever properly understood me, I have never fully understood anyone; and no one understands anyone else.\u2019\n\nIt was a helpful outburst from a great man. It isn\u2019t our fault: a degree of distance and mutual incomprehension is not a sign that life has gone wrong; it\u2019s what we should expect from the very start. And when we do, benefits may flow. The history of art is the record of people who couldn\u2019t find anyone in the vicinity to talk to. We can take up the coded offer of intimacy in the words of a Roman poet who died in 10 BCE or the lyrics of a singer who described just our blues in a recording from Nashville in 1963.\n\nLoneliness makes us more capable of true intimacy if better opportunities ever come along. It heightens the conversations we have with ourselves; it gives us a character. We don\u2019t repeat what everyone else thinks. We develop a point of view. We might be isolated for now, but we\u2019ll be capable of far closer, more interesting bonds with anyone we do eventually locate.\n\nLoneliness renders us elegant and strangely alluring. It suggests there is more about us to understand than the normal patterns of social intercourse can accommodate \u2013 which is something to take pride in. A sense of isolation truly is \u2013 as we suspect but usually prevent ourselves from feeling from fear of arrogance \u2013 a sign of depth. When we admit our loneliness, we are signing up to a club that includes the people we know from the paintings of Edward Hopper, the poems of Baudelaire and the songs of Leonard Cohen.\n\nLonely, we enter a long and grand tradition; we find ourselves (surprisingly) in great company.\n\nSee also: Normality; Oral Sex; Psychological Asymmetry; Sane Insanity; Warmth.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Long-Term Love\n\nMuch of our collective thinking about love targets the problems we face around starting a relationship. To the Romantic, love essentially means \u2018finding love\u2019. What we blithely call a love story is mostly in fact the start of a love story.\n\nYet the true, heroic challenges of love are concerned with how to keep love going over the long term, in the face of hurdles not generally discussed in art and, as a result, lacking glamour: incompatible work schedules, differing ideas about bathroom etiquette, phone calls with ex-partners, waning lust, the demands of household management, business trips that clash with anniversaries, the question of whether and when to have children, divergent parenting styles, problematic in-laws and economic stresses.\n\nTo negotiate these challenges, long-term love requires us to develop a host of skills that our societies tend to stay quiet about: forgiveness, charity, humour, imagination and seeing the other as a loveable idiot (rather than simply a disappointment). To love over time involves striving to understand what another person is really trying to say when they are upset, even if what they are uttering is on the surface shockingly disdainful. It might involve discovering the dignity of domestic chores or a melancholy acceptance that a good relationship might require the sacrifice of certain dreams of sexual fulfilment. We\u2019ll have to say sorry even if we are not really at fault; we\u2019ll have to tell many little white lies and occasionally rather large ones; we\u2019ll have to face the fact that we\u2019ll discover some grim shortcomings in the other person, and they in us.\n\nRealistic, scratchy, long-term love is diametrically at odds with the Romantic vision of being in love. Therefore, by the standards of Romantic love, it has to look like an unfolding catastrophe. Far from it: it is what naturally happens when love is reciprocated and when decent, normal people live side by side for a long time. It is part of what good ordinary relationships look like over the years. It is what happens when love succeeds.\n\nSee also: Crushes; Domesticity; Loving and Being Loved; Romantic Instinct; Sex and Love.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Lottery of Life\n\nIn the modern world, many countries have lotteries in which millions of people participate every week in the hope of suddenly acquiring a substantial fortune. A striking thing is that it\u2019s often quite disadvantaged and uneducated people who are most enthusiastic about lotteries. We might smile at their folly in getting statistics quite so wrong; if they had the wisdom and mathematical intelligence to understand how slim their chances were, they\u2019d surely never bother. The chances of winning the largest payout is around one in fourteen million. We naturally feel a bit sorry for people investing in such slender hopes; they are taking aim at an impossibly small target.\n\nBut we\u2019re probably no better. We may not have a sense that we\u2019re playing any kind of lottery, and yet we are: the Lottery of Life. We too are clutching tickets of various kinds and setting our sights on statistical near-miracles \u2013 even while we think we\u2019re being utterly sober, rational and level-headed. The crucial place where this lottery-like behaviour happens is in relation to our hopes of happiness in two areas in particular: love and work.\n\nIf we were forced to spell out a picture of an ideally successful life, it might go something like this. We early on pick just the right area of work to apply ourselves to, swerve neatly into new fields at the ideal moment, and receive public recognition, money and honour for our efforts. Work is fun, creative and utterly in line with our talents.\n\nThere are similar satisfactions to be had around love. After a spate of compelling and passionate relationships, we meet one very special, beautiful, kind and devoted person who understands us completely \u2013 often without us needing to communicate with words. Sex is extraordinary and children and domesticity never grind us down. We enjoy perfect health and retire with the feeling of having accomplished what we set out to do. We experience a dignified, respected old age, admired by our descendants and occasionally exercising a deft guiding touch behind the scenes as an \u00e9minence grise. We die gently in our late nineties of a non-painful illness in a tranquil, flower-filled room, having written a wise and generous will.\n\nSuch scenarios occur about as often as a payout on the lottery. But (to our surprise, despite our education and apparently realistic and practical natures), we may have strongly invested in some modified version of just this form of phantasm. We don\u2019t grasp just how rare and strange ninety years on earth without calamities in love and work might actually be.\n\nIf we could see what love and work were really like for most other people, we\u2019d be much less sad about our own situation and attainments. If we could fly across the world and peer into everyone\u2019s lives and minds like an all-seeing angel, we\u2019d perceive how very frequent disappointment is, how much unfulfilled ambition is circulating, how much confusion and uncertainty is played out in private, and how many breakdowns and intemperate arguments unfold with every new day. Then we would realise just how abnormal \u2013 statistically speaking \u2013 and therefore cruel the goals we have set ourselves really are.\n\nIt would be a painful lesson in some ways. We might be shocked and saddened by what we saw. We would be disappointed, of course, to conclude that, in all probability, we wouldn\u2019t achieve what we\u2019d hoped for. But in another way it would be a comforting and deeply reassuring experience. We\u2019d feel a little more tenderness towards ourselves for not having \u2013 in effect \u2013 won the Lottery of Life.\n\nWithout being overtly naive, most of us are holding out hopes equivalent to thinking we might win a major lottery. We don\u2019t deserve criticism. We need to pity ourselves for the formidable obstacles that stand in the way of the kind of success that it is so normal to want, yet so rare to have.\n\nSee also: Expectations; Luck; Meritocracy; Normality.",

To seek to change one\u2019s lover feels like a profound offence against the whole idea of love.\n\nThis way of thinking about and experiencing love can feel entirely natural, but it is a relatively recent historical invention. It stands in sharp contrast to a much older and in certain ways wiser view: the Classical idea that love is an arena of growth and change. This view of love was developed in Ancient Greece, prompted particularly by the philosophical ideas of Socrates and Plato. As they saw it, the task of love is first and foremost to educate one\u2019s lover. We don\u2019t love someone because we think they are perfect already, but because we can see what they could be; we love their potential and their emergent (but not yet fully developed) qualities. Their deep attachment to us means that we have an ideal opportunity for guiding and shaping their development towards the articulation of their full potential. Love is a mutually supportive structure in which two people can guide one another to their respective virtuous ideal selves.\n\nThis pedagogical view of love now sounds extremely odd. We don\u2019t imagine love as a classroom. Our current culture imagines the lover as a great admirer. Classical culture imagined them as a great teacher \u2013 the person best fitted to edge us towards becoming who we should be. We are suspicious because we think of teaching in the guise of nagging: the pure demand for change, rather than an eloquent enticement to surrender our entrenched flaws.\n\nSee also: Love Me as I Am; Teaching and Learning.",

From this perspective, to love means not only or primarily to experience admiration in the face of perfection; it involves a capacity to be uncommonly generous towards a fellow human at moments when they may be less than straightforwardly appealing. Love is taken to mean not a thrill in the face of accomplishment but a distinctive skill founded on the ability to see beyond a person\u2019s off-putting outer dimensions, an energy to enter imaginatively into their experiences and bestow an ongoing degree of forgiveness and kindness in spite of marked trickiness and confusion.\n\nSee also: Being \u2018Good\u2019; Crushes; Emotional Translation; Kintsugi; Listening as Editing; Loving and Being Loved; Romantic Disappointment; Snobbery; Universal Love; Weakness of Strength.",

In moments of fury with our partners, we may be tempted to dismiss their complaints against us with the cry: \u2018Love me as I am\u2019.\n\nBut in truth, none of us should want to remain exactly as we are \u2013 and therefore none of us should too strongly want another person to love (as opposed to tolerate or simply forgive) what is warped within us.\n\nGenuine love might be defined as gently and kindly helping someone to become the best version of themselves rather than accepting them precisely as they are. It isn\u2019t a betrayal of love for someone to try to help us evolve or to teach us to be better people; it may be the highest proof of genuine commitment.\n\nUnfortunately, under the sway of Romantic ideology that makes us suspicious of emotional education, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students. We don\u2019t accept the legitimacy, let alone nobility, of others\u2019 desire to teach us and can\u2019t acknowledge areas where we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover\u2019s education that would enable criticism to be moulded into sensible-sounding lessons and to be heard as caring attempts to rejig the more troublesome aspects of our personalities.\n\nAt the first sign that the other is adopting a teacherly tone, we tend to assume that we are being \u2018attacked\u2019 and betrayed.

Our idea of love has taken this attitude to heart: it\u2019s what (we think) love is supposed to be like. The suggestion that another could change, grow, or improve is taken as an insult to love.\n\nThe problem is: the mother never in fact loved us just as we were. She hoped we would keep growing up. And the need is still there. Our bodies may be fully formed, but our psyches always have some way to go.

It appears that we can only make a relationship work properly when we are ready to do the latter and are aware of our unnatural, immature fixation on the former.\n\nWe start knowing only about being loved. It comes to seem very wrongly like the norm. To the child, it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand to comfort, guide, entertain, feed and clear up while remaining almost always warm and cheerful. The parents don\u2019t reveal how often they\u2019ve bitten their tongue, fought back tears, and been too tired to take off their clothes after a day of childcare.\n\nWe learn of love in an entirely non-reciprocal context. The parent loves but they don\u2019t expect the favour to be returned in any significant way. The parent doesn\u2019t get upset when the child doesn\u2019t notice a new haircut or ask carefully calibrated questions about how the meeting at work went or suggest that the parent go upstairs and take a much-needed nap. Parent and child may both love, but each party is on a very different end of the axis -\u2013 unbeknownst to the child.\n\nThis is why in adulthood when we first say that we long for love, what we predominantly mean is that we want to be loved as we were once loved by a parent. We want a re-creation in adulthood of what it felt like to be administered to and indulged. In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want, be immensely sympathetic and patient towards us, act selflessly and make many things better.\n\nNaturally, this is a disaster for our unions. For any relationship to work, we need to move firmly out of the position of the child and into that of the parent. We need to become someone who can sometimes subordinate their own demands to the needs of another.\n\nTo be adults in love, we have to learn \u2013 perhaps for the very first time \u2013 to do something truly remarkable: to put someone else ahead of us, for a time at least. That\u2019s what true, mature love actually is, much to everyone\u2019s initial surprise.\n\nSee also: Long-Term Love; Love as Generosity; Other-as-Child; Romantic Disappointment.",

We would think it extremely suspicious if someone explained that they had been sacked, but added that this was simply the result of \u2018bad luck\u2019. We would think it equally strange if someone said they had made many millions, but ascribed their triumph to mere \u2018good luck\u2019. We resist the notion that luck can play a significant role as much in our failures as in our successes. Luck presents a substantial offence against modern ideals of control, strategy and foresight. We understand ourselves to be \u2013 for better and for worse \u2013 the authors of our own destinies.\n\nModern civilisation itself could be viewed as a gigantic protest against the role of chance in human affairs. Science, insurance, medicine and public education take up arms against luck, and have won enormous battles against it; so many, in fact, that it has grown devilishly tempting to believe that we may have vanquished chance altogether.\n\nHowever, luck is a fearsome enemy; its territory is fluid and its power unpredictable and tempestuous. Wisdom requires us to accept that it will never be entirely tamed. Within every success, however ardent our efforts, there is sure to be a substantial degree of luck. More redemptively, within every failure there is sure to be much that cannot be ascribed to our foolishness alone. We make small mistakes all the time; it is only occasionally that a modest error turns out to have devastating consequences.\n\nThere are some who already believe too much in luck; they are excessively willing to assign all the outcomes of their lives to chance. They need to hear more about responsibility and the capacity of individuals to transform their circumstances. But, in many ways, these passive actors are ever less common in the modern world. For the rest of us, those who operate with a daunting feeling of personal responsibility, who will constantly push themselves to match their highest expectations and berate themselves for failure, a reverential belief in luck should be far more than a historical curiosity. It remains a crucial concept to take the edge off our arrogance and, when fate has turned against us, to temper the violence of our self-contempt.\n\nSee also: Day of Judgement; Expectations; Lottery of Life; Meritocracy; Suicide; Tragedy.",

A meaningful life draws upon, and exercises, a range of our higher capacities: those bound up with tenderness, care, connection, self-understanding, sympathy, intelligence and creativity.\n\nA meaningful life aims not so much at day-to-day contentment as fulfilment. We may be leading a meaningful life and yet often be in a bad mood \u2013 just as we may be having frequent surface fun while living, for the most part, meaninglessly.\n\nA meaningful life is bound up with the long term. Projects, relationships, interests and commitments will build up cumulatively. Meaningful activities leave something behind, even when the emotions that once propelled us into them have passed.\n\nMeaningful activities aren\u2019t necessarily those we do most often. They are those we value most highly and will, from the perspective of our deaths, regret most deeply.\n\nThe question of what makes life meaningful has to be answered personally, even if our conclusions are marked by no particular idiosyncrasy. Others cannot be relied upon to determine what will be meaningful to us. What we call \u2018crises of meaning\u2019 are generally moments when someone else\u2019s \u2013 perhaps well-intentioned \u2013 interpretation of what might be meaningful to us runs up against a growing realisation of our divergent tastes and interests.\n\nBy a process of experience and introspection, we have to work out what counts as meaningful in our eyes. Whereas pleasure manifests itself immediately, our taste in meaning may be more elusive. We can be relatively far into our lives before we securely identify what lends them their meaning.\n\nThat said, The School of Life considers that meaningful lives are generally anchored around eight themes: love, family, work, friendship, culture, politics, nature and philosophy. Most are well known; the point isn\u2019t to identify entirely new sources of meaning so much as to try to evoke and explain some familiar choices.\n\nTo wonder too openly, or intensely, about the Meaning of Life sounds like a peculiar, ill-fated and unintentionally comedic pastime. It isn\u2019t anything an ordinary mortal should be doing \u2013 or would get very far by doing. Without always acknowledging it, we are operating with a remarkably ungenerous perspective on the Meaning of Life.\n\nYet the subject is for everyone; it is for all of us to wonder about, and define, a meaningful existence. There need be nothing forbidding about the issue. A meaningful life can be simple in structure, personal, usable, attractive and familiar. It is time to turn the pursuit of a meaningful life from a comedically complex impossibility to something we can all comprehend, aim for and succeed at.\n\nSee also: Eudaimonia",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Meaningful Work\n\nWhen we talk about jobs being meaningful or meaningless, we are at heart asking whether these jobs are helping anyone\u2019s life to be better: we\u2019re wondering whether our work stands a chance of increasing someone\u2019s pleasure or reducing their suffering. Unlike what standard economics tells us, we are desperate to make a significant contribution to the good. It is hard to be happy at work without a sense that we have proved of assistance to someone else.\n\nOne of the greatest enemies of \u2018meaning\u2019 in the modern world is the sheer scale of businesses. Corporations coordinate the labours of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of people \u2013 and raise productivity exponentially. But extreme specialisation and global reach can gravely reduce the sense of meaning that any one employee might have. A packaging supervisor in Malm\u00f6 might not have much idea of how their work fits in with the activities of a geochemist in Ghana who compares activated alumina with indigenous laterite and bauxite as potential sorbents for removing fluoride from drinking water, or with the concerns of a legal expert currently staying in the Alvear Hotel in Buenos Aires and reporting to a steering committee in New York about the implications of proposed revisions to Section 14 of the Argentine Mining Code. All these individuals might be working for the same rather noble cause, but none of them can quite remember day to day what the real cause actually is.\n\nMost work now takes place within gigantic organisations that are engaged in a variety of large, complicated and slow-moving projects. Therefore it can be hard to derive, on a daily basis, any tangible sense of having improved anyone else\u2019s life. The customer and the end product are, in the gigantic structures of modernity, simply too far away in space and too distant in time. One can be unable easily to reassure oneself of one\u2019s worth and purpose when one is only a single unit among a twenty-thousand-strong team on four continents pushing forward a project that might be ready in five years\u2019 time.\n\nThere are sound reasons why the work practices of large organisations proceed at such scale \u2013 typically at a glacial pace. Product developments in aeronautics and banking, oil and pharmaceuticals cannot happen overnight. The timeframes are logical, but in terms of individual experience, they go directly against our natural, deeply embedded preference for a rapidly unfolding story.\n\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed that a key requirement for a satisfying piece of theatre was that it should be over relatively quickly. There might be tensions and complications and unexpected changes of direction, but in a few hours and three acts, there should be a feeling of genuine completion. It\u2019s not just in the theatre that speed is attractive. The concentration of action also helps to explain the appeal of sport. In ninety minutes, a football match can take us from a perfect, neutral start to a precise result.\n\nHowever, if football were like modern work in terms of scale and pace, one can imagine it unfolding on eighteen pitches with twenty-two balls and two thousand players kicking around for thousands of days without any overview of the progress of the game. By the standards of our innate longings, our work unfolds in a very disordered, over-extended and confusing way.\n\nOur labour feels meaningful not only when it is fast, but also when we get to witness the ways we are helping others: when we can leave the office, factory or shop with an impression of having fixed a problem in someone else\u2019s life. This pleasure too is threatened by scale. In the massive organisations of modernity, we may be so distant from the end users of our products and services as to be unable to derive any real benefit from our constructive role in their lives. Spending days improving terms on contracts in the logistics industry truly will lead to a moment when a couple can contentedly enjoy some ginger biscuits together in front of the TV; optimising data management across different parts of an aerospace firm truly will \u2013 along with thousands of other coordinated efforts \u2013 contribute to the moment when a young family can bond together on a beach holiday. The connections are genuine, but they are so extended and convoluted as to feel dispiritingly flimsy and unreal in our minds.\n\nIt is a tantalising paradox, and a kind of tragedy, that because of the unavoidable scale of modern work, we may pass our lives helping other people and yet, day to day, be burdened by a harrowing feeling of having made no difference whatsoever.\n\nPart of the answer to our feelings of disconnection and disorientation lies in a discipline at the heart of culture: the art of storytelling. As the complexity and scale of organisations increase, so we need to learn how to arrange a disparate selection of events into a master narrative that can lend them coherence and thereby remind us of how we might fit into a meaningful whole. A company\u2019s \u2018story\u2019 has a lot in common with a large, layered novel. One can imagine a company novel that would begin with a description of someone accessing a bank account in Salzburg. The next moment, we would be in a restaurant in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, where a deal is being hammered out to transfer crates to Dubai. Then the focus would be on a meeting taking place in a basement in Whitehall, where regulations for consumer goods would be discussed between ministers and a set of civil servants. Then would come a section set in a call centre in Phoenix, closely followed by a scene in a nursery in Seattle. But rather than a hopeless confusion, the point would be to reveal how these apparently random incidents were in fact profoundly interconnected, pointing to a grand synthetic goal: the creation of a new IT system for an office in Munich, or a project to increase the flow rate of a pump production line in southern Spain.\n\nOnce scattered events are woven together into a story, they can start to feel very meaningful indeed. Ideally, every large company would have storytellers on the payroll.\n\nSee also: Duty Trap, The; Service; Specialisation; Vocation Myth; Work/Life Balance.",

It is not a disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgement of how much pain we must all inevitably travel through.\n\nModern society tends to emphasise buoyancy and cheerfulness. It is impatient with melancholy states, and wishes either to medicalise \u2013 and therefore \u2018solve\u2019 \u2013 them, or deny their legitimacy altogether.\n\nMelancholy links pain with wisdom and beauty. It springs from a rightful awareness of the tragic structure of every life. In melancholy states, we can understand without fury or sentimentality that no one truly understands anyone else, that loneliness is universal, and that every life has its full measure of shame and sorrow. The melancholy know that many of the things we most want are in tragic conflict: to feel secure, and yet to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be beholden to others; to be in close-knit communities and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of society; to travel and explore the world and yet to put down deep roots; to fulfil the demands of our appetites for food, exploration and sloth \u2013 and yet stay thin, sober, faithful and fit.\n\nThe wisdom of the melancholy attitude (as opposed to the bitter or angry one) lies in the understanding that we have not been singled out; that our suffering belongs to humanity in general. Melancholy is marked by an impersonal take on suffering. It is filled with pity for the human condition.\n\nThere are melancholy landscapes and melancholy pieces of music, melancholy poems and melancholy times of day. In them, we find echoes of our own griefs, returned back to us without some of the personal associations that, when they first struck us, made them particularly agonising.\n\nThe task of culture is to turn both rage and its disguised twin, jolliness, into melancholy.\n\nThe more melancholy a culture can be, the less its individual members need to be persecuted by their own failures, lost illusions and regrets.\n\nWhen it can be shared, melancholy is the beginning of friendship.\n\nSee also: Consolation; Jolliness; Splitting and Integration; Vulnerability.",

The oversight costs us dear, for it is only through a visceral awareness of our impending end that we are granted the courage and urgency to get on with the vital (but often daunting) tasks of our lives.\n\nThe Renaissance artistic tradition of the Memento Mori (\u2018Reminder of death\u2019) provided striking visual images to keep the idea of our own mortality and the radically uncertain time of our demise constantly before our eyes. The theorists of this tradition grasped that for an idea to be compelling and to guide our conduct with true force, it needs to come via art \u2013 that is, wrapped up in a seductive outer layer that appeals to our emotions. We need to see a haunting skull, weeping mourners, rotting flesh, so that what might otherwise have been merely abstract and easily dismissed can turn into a resonant truth with a chance of truly influencing how we live.\n\nThe Memento Mori is an example of art being used for a precise psychological purpose. Instead of waiting for artists to produce whatever happened to interest them, the philosophers of the Renaissance identified important needs and commissioned artists to work on them. Painters were given a specific job description: makers of things that remind us of death. Ideas were united with the tools for their powerful transmission.\n\nSuch a psychological mission should remain a central purpose of artistic activity. The task of art is to find new and freshly forceful ways of keeping the most important ideas about how to live and die well constantly at the front of our minds.\n\nSee also: Akrasia, Art, The Purpose of; Ritual, Seduction.",

It is applauded for doing so, and condemned for not doing so fast enough.\n\nBut there is a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: if we truly believe that we have created (or could one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it follows that we have to hold the failures exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable but also deserved.\n\nThe question of why, if one is in any way good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.\n\nMeritocracy turns failure from a problem into a catastrophe.\n\nSee also: Day of Judgement; Equality and Envy; Lottery of Life; Luck; Snobbery; Suicide",

Misemployment refers to the state of being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any sincerity the higher needs of others, merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead.\n\nThe ranks of the misemployed are populated by workers who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits, and tempting but highly sugared drinks.\n\nThe rate of Misemployment in the economy is never formally measured, but it might be very high. In the Utopia, government would track not just how many people had a job, but how many had a job that catered to higher needs. Economists have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy is the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment is to \u2018stimulate demand\u2019. Although technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and Misemployment.\n\nThere are real solutions to bringing down the rate of Misemployment. The trick isn\u2019t just to stimulate demand per se but to stimulate good demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.\n\nIn a nation properly concerned with Misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. Twenty per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another thirty per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul.\n\nTo achieve such a state, it isn\u2019t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the importance of what is truly valuable and walk past what betrays their potential.\n\nEmployment figures are far from irrelevant; they matter a great deal. They are the first things that need to be attended to. All the same, the raw figures mask a more ambitious goal: that of learning to deploy human capital in a properly admirable way.\n\nSee also: Architecture; Faulty Walnut, The; Secularisation; Utopia.",

They were highly engineered machines for helping their inhabitants to think. They were begun because certain people wanted to think very carefully about a range of vital questions: what is the nature of God and what does God want from me? What is the Divine and what is Grace? What is owed to Jesus and what is owed to Caesar?\n\nThese believers realised that the human mind is an extremely flighty and easily distracted organ. The prospect of a party at the end of the week, the chatter of a few people out in the street, the sight of an exciting book \u2013 all these can derail our attempts to focus our minds.\n\nSo the founders of monasteries went to immense efforts to create environments that could positively assist their members to think fruitfully. They situated their buildings far from cities; they built high walls around their estates; they laid out highly symmetrical gardens and walkways; they made sure their food was nutritious but plain. They encouraged only quiet conversation over meals. They went to bed early and rose at dawn. They did moderate exercise every other day.\n\nToday, we probably don\u2019t want to think so much about the particular questions that monks and nuns once focused on. However, we still have a lot of thinking to do. We have equally important thinking tasks to perform around relationships, work and the meaning of our lives.\n\nFor these challenges, monasteries retain some important lessons for us. We can be inspired by their ambition to go beyond ordinary expectations and set up ideal conditions where a person might think as well as possible. This contrasts with a more Romantic attitude that sees thinking as mainly influenced by other thoughts \u2013 particularly by books \u2013 and doesn\u2019t quite accept that an organ as elevated as the mind may be assisted by something as ostensibly trivial as going for a walk or having only a light salad for lunch.\n\nIn the Utopia, we should learn to design our own highly engineered machines for thinking \u2013 institutions geared to the task of deftly extracting our best thoughts from our squeamish and recalcitrant minds.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Architecture; Faulty Walnut, The; Secularisation; Utopia.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Music\n\nMusic is of central importance to most of us. Tellingly, we are extremely picky not just about what music we listen to, but also about when we do so. To understand why, we need to focus on a peculiar but crucial fact about ourselves. We are highly emotional beings, but not all of our emotions make their way fully and properly to the front of our conscious attention when they need to. They are there, but only in a latent, muted, undeveloped way. There\u2019s too much noise both externally and internally.\n\nIn the background, we may be storing up the ingredients for a range of profound and potentially very important emotions: the raw matter for grief or sorrow; a sense of tender generosity towards humanity in general; a quiet sense of the beauty of modesty; or pity for ourselves. We may ponder all the errors we didn\u2019t mean to make; all the ways we\u2019ve wasted our potential or didn\u2019t properly return love when it was offered. These feelings and many others are the emotional containers of profound wisdom. But they may not have the sway they ideally should in our lives because they don\u2019t get sustained attention and an opportunity to develop. They exist as confused, weak signals in us \u2013 hardly noticeable, easily disregarded blips of sensation, raw matter that has not been catalysed. The beauty, goodness, consolation and strength they could bring us never quite emerge; we bear within us a legacy of unfelt feelings.\n\nThis is why music matters: it offers amplification and encouragement. Specific pieces of music give strength and support to valuable but tentative emotional dispositions. A euphoric song amplifies the faint but ecstatic feeling that we could love everyone and find true delight in being alive. Day to day, these feelings exist, but are buried by the pressure to be limited, cautious and reserved. The song pushes them forward and gives them confidence; it provides the space in which they can grow. Given this encouragement, we can give them a bigger place in our lives.\n\nA sombre, tender piece may coax to the surface our submerged sadness. Under its encouraging tutelage, we can more easily feel sorry for the ways we have hurt others; we can pay greater attention to our own inner pain (and hence be more appreciative of small acts of gentleness from others); we become more alive to universal suffering, to the fact that everyone loses the things they love, and that everyone is burdened with regrets. With the help of particular chords, a compassionate side of ourselves, which is normally hard to access, becomes more prominent.\n\nA different kind of music might take up our low-key impulses to action and self-transformation: it rouses us; it quickens our pace. We want to stride to its beat and make the best use of our energies while there is still time. Other songs could boost our fragile sense that certain things don\u2019t really matter all that much. The meeting didn\u2019t go very well, but so what? In the end it\u2019s not that important. The kitchen was a bit messy, but it\u2019s not a big deal in the cosmic scheme. Our reserves of perspective are activated; we are fortified in our capacity to cope with the petty irritations that would otherwise undermine us.\n\nLike an amplifier with its signal, music doesn\u2019t invent emotion; it takes what is there and makes it louder. One might worry that boosting an emotion might be risky. After all, not everything we feel is worthy of encouragement. It is possible to use music to magnify feelings of hatred or to inflate violent impulses; the culture ministries of fascist dictatorships have been fatefully skilled at doing just this. But, almost always, we face a very different issue around music: we\u2019re not building up our courage to lay waste to civilisation. We want to strengthen our capacities for calm, forgiveness, love and appreciation.\n\nIn our relationship to music we\u2019re seeking the right soundtrack for our lives. A soundtrack in a film helps accord the due emotional resonance to a specific scene. It helps us register the actual pathos of a situation that might be missed if we relied on words and images alone; it helps us fully recognise the identity of a moment.\n\nExactly the same is true in our lives: we\u2019re constantly faced with situations where something significant is going on; at the back of our minds the helpful emotional reaction is there, but it\u2019s subdued and drowned out by the ambient noise of existence. Music is the opposite of noise: it is the cure for noise. By finding the right piece of music at the right time we\u2019re adding an accompanying score that highlights the emotions we should be feeling more strongly and allows our own best reactions to be more prominent and secure. We end up feeling the emotions that are our due.\n\nSee also: Art, The Purpose of; Artistic Rebalancing.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Nagging\n\nNagging is the dispiriting, unpleasant, counter-productive but wholly understandable and poignant version of a hugely noble ambition: the desire to change other people.\n\nThere is so much we might fairly want to change about people. We want them to be more self-aware, punctual, generous, reliable, introspective, resilient, communicative and profound. At home, we want them to focus more on the sink, the children, the bins, the money and the need to put the phone down and look up. At a macro dimension, we want them to think more about the suffering of encaged animals, the destruction of our habitat and the iniquities of capitalism. The desire to change people is no pathology; it is a clear-sighted recognition of the scale of human wickedness.\n\nIn its essence, nagging is an attempt at teaching, at transmitting an idea for improvement from one mind into another. But it is also a version of teaching that has given up hope. It has descended into an attempt to insist rather than invite, to coerce rather than charm. One has grown too weary and humiliated by constant rebuffs to have the energy to seduce. One is too panicked by the thought that the unteachable \u2018student\u2019 is ruining one\u2019s life to find the inner resources to see it a little more from their point of view. It is one\u2019s own suffering that dominates all the available imaginative capacity.\n\nSo one gets straight to the point, gets rid of the garlands, omits the honey and says it in plain terms. The bins need attention now. Get to the table immediately. You\u2019re a selfish layabout. Not there, here... One isn\u2019t wrong. One is very right, but also very tired and, deep down, grief-stricken.\n\nLamentably, also, it doesn\u2019t work. By the time one has started humiliating any student, the lesson is over. Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking. The other pretends to read the paper, goes upstairs and feels righteous. The shrillness of one\u2019s tone gives them all the excuse they need to trust that we have nothing kind or true to tell them.\n\nOne changes others only when the desire that they evolve has not reached an insistent pitch; when we can still bear that they remain as they are. All of us improve only when we have not been badgered or made to feel guilty; only when we have a sense that we are loved and deeply understood for the many reasons why change is so hard for us. We know, of course, that the bins need our attention, that we should strive to get to bed earlier and that we have been a disappointment. But we can\u2019t bear to hear these lessons in an unsympathetic tone; tricky children that we are, we want to be indulged for our ambivalence about becoming better people.\n\nThe same obtuse dynamic is at play at the political level. We know we shouldn\u2019t abuse the planet, bend rules or close our hearts to the unfortunate. But we won\u2019t do any of the good things if a dour figure wags their finger and delivers stern lectures. We want to be charmed, not dragged, into goodness.\n\nThe tragedy of nagging is that its causes are usually so noble, and still it doesn\u2019t work. We nag because we feel that our possession of the truth lets us off having to convey it elegantly. It never does. The solution to nagging is not to give up trying to get others to do what we want. Rather, it is to recognise that persuasion needs to occur in terms that make sense to those we want to alter.\n\nSee also: Artistic Sympathy; Saints; Seduction; Teaching and Learning.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Nastiness\n\nIt happens pretty much all the time: a small jabbing comment, a joke at our expense amid a group of old friends, a line of sarcasm, a sneering assessment, a provocative comment on the internet.\n\nThese things hurt a lot \u2013 more than we\u2019re ever allowed to admit. In the privacy of our minds, we search for explanations, but anything satisfying and soothing is usually hard to come by. We\u2019re left to puzzle at the casual inhumanity that circulates all around us \u2013 and suspect that, somewhere deep down, it\u2019s we who are to blame for falling victim to it.\n\nThis is what we should actually think, a truth as basic as it is inviolable: other people have been nasty because they are in pain. The only reason they have hurt us is because, somewhere deep inside, they are hurting themselves. They have been catty, derogatory and foul because they are not well. However outwardly confident they may look, however virile and robust they may appear, their actions are all the evidence we need that they cannot be in a good place. No one solid would ever need to do this.\n\nThe thought is empowering because nastiness so readily humiliates and reduces us. It turns us into the small damaged party. Without meaning to, we begin to imagine our bully as potent and even somehow impressive. Their vindictiveness demeans us. But the psychological explanation of evil at once reverses the power dynamic. It is you, who has no need to belittle, who is in fact the larger, steelier, more forceful party; you \u2013 who feels so defenceless \u2013 who is actually in power.\n\nThe thought restores justice. It promises that the guilty party has \u2013 after all \u2013 been punished along the way. You might not have been able to right the scales personally, but a kind of punishment has been delivered cosmically somewhere behind the scenes; their suffering, of which their need to inflict suffering on others is incontrovertible evidence, is all you need to know that they have been served their just desserts. You move from being a victim of crime to being an audience to an abstract form of justice. They may not be apologising to you, but they haven\u2019t escaped freely either; their sulphur is proof that they are paying a heavy price.\n\nThis is not merely a pleasant story. A person who feels at ease with themselves can have no need to distress others. We don\u2019t have the energy to be cruel unless, and until, we are in inner torment.\n\nAlong the way, the theory hints at how we might \u2013 when we have recovered from the blow \u2013 deal with those who dealt it. The temptation is to be stern and cruel back, but the only way to diminish the vicious cycle of hate is to address its origins, which lie in suffering. There is no point punching back. We must learn to look upon our enemies with sorrow, pity and, when we can manage it, a forgiving kind of love.\n\nSee also: Androcles and the Lion.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Nature\n\nNature is valuable not only for itself; it is also to be revered as the single most persuasive and redemptive work of philosophy.\n\nNature corrects our erroneous, and ultimately very painful, sense that we are essentially free. The idea that we have the freedom to fashion our own destinies as we please has become central to our contemporary worldview: we are encouraged to imagine that we can, with time, create exactly the lives we desire, around our relationships, our work and our existence more generally. This hopeful scenario has been the source of extraordinary and unnecessary suffering.\n\nThere are many things we desperately want to avoid, which we will spend huge parts of our lives worrying about and that we will then bitterly resent when they force themselves upon us nevertheless.\n\nThe idea of inevitability is central to the natural world: the deciduous tree has to shed its leaves when the temperature dips in autumn; the river must erode its banks; the cold front will deposit its rain; the tide has to rise and fall. The laws of nature are governed by forces nobody chose, no one can resist, and that brook no exception.\n\nWhen we contemplate nature (a forest in the autumn, for example, or the reproductive cycle of a salmon), we are witnessing rules that in their broad irresistible structure apply to ourselves as well. We too must mature, seek to reproduce, age, fall ill and die. We face a litany of other burdens too: we will never be fully understood by others; we will always be burdened by primordial anxiety; we will never fully know what it is like to be someone else; we will invariably fantasise about more than we can have; we will realise that in key ways we cannot be who we want to be.\n\nWhat we most fear will happen irrespective of our wishes. But when we see frustration as a law of nature, we drain it of some of its sting and bitterness. We recognise that limitations are not in any way unique to us. In awesome, majestic scenes (the life cycle of an elephant; the eruption of a volcano), nature moves us away from our habitual tendency to personalise and rail against our suffering.\n\nA central task of culture should be to remind us that the laws of nature apply to us as well as to trees, clouds and cliff faces. Our goal is to become clearer about where our own tantalisingly powerful yet always limited agency stops, and where we will be left with no option but to bow to forces infinitely greater than our own.\n\nSee also: Animals; Sublime, The.",

After an interval, usually no longer than a night (and often far less; if we\u2019re feeling particularly restless, we might only manage to go for five minutes before our resolve breaks), we interrupt whatever we are doing in order to check the news. We put our lives on hold in the expectation of receiving yet another dose of critical information about all the most significant achievements, catastrophes, crimes, epidemics and romantic complications to have befallen humankind around the planet since we last had a look.\n\nSocieties become modern, the philosopher Hegel suggested, when news replaces religion as our central source of guidance and our touchstone of moral authority. In the developed economies, the news now occupies a position of power at least equal to that formerly enjoyed by the faiths. News dispatches track the canonical hours with uncanny precision: matins have been transubstantiated into the breakfast bulletin, vespers into the evening report. But the news doesn\u2019t just follow a quasi-religious timetable. It also demands of us that we approach it with some of the same deferential expectations we would once have harboured of our faiths. Here, too, we hope to receive revelations, learn who is good and bad, fathom suffering and understand the unfolding logic of existence. Here too, if we refuse to take part in the rituals, there could be imputations of heresy.\n\nFor most of history, \u2018news\u2019 was for the few. It comprised hugely expensive information designed to help kings and queens manage their lands. There was a practical purpose behind the need to know.\n\nToday, news is still sold to us on the basis that it is information vital for our lives. The presumption is that we need to know a great deal about disasters pretty much anywhere in the world, about the doings of the rich and famous and about what\u2019s been going on in the last few hours at the top levels of government. In consequence, we get a chaotic and deeply distorted picture of a world composed of crises, violence and celebrity parties \u2013 and we are continuously pulled away from our own priorities and attempts to focus on the management of our lives.\n\nIn the Utopia, news would be much more ambitious. Outlets would compete to provide the information we needed to help us to live and die well, but didn\u2019t yet possess. This might include bulletins on what had just happened or it might include things that had happened long ago. These would be defined as \u2018news\u2019 because the story hadn\u2019t yet reached our ears. We might not have heard that Socrates had unravelled the mystery of love or that Emile Durkheim had worked out why we get more stressed as societies become more prosperous \u2013 even though these discoveries were made long ago \u2013 just as the invention of writing would have been \u2018news\u2019 to a Pictish warrior many centuries after it was common knowledge to the bureaucrats of Mesopotamia.\n\nTo succeed commercially, truly helpful news needs to be seductive, artful and entertaining; it can\u2019t just be earnest. In the ideal future, news might still have a tabloid style \u2013 attention- grabbing, brief, entertaining and making an undisguised appeal to our sensual appetites \u2013 only this style would be in the service of a more accurate assessment of what we actually need to know in order to be wise.\n\nSee also: Art and News; Censorship; History.",

That\u2019s why we\u2019ve ringed the earth with satellites, crisscrossed it with fibre-optic cables, and created networks of bureaus that inform us with maniacal urgency of pretty much any event to have unfolded anywhere on the planet in the last few moments. Furthermore, we are equipped with tiny devices that we keep very close to hand, so as to monitor all unfolding stories in close to real time. We have been granted a ringside seat on the second-by-second flow of history.\n\nAs a result, we see a lot more. At the same time, strangely, we see a lot less. The constant presence of news from without hampers our ability to pick up on an equally important, though far less prestigious, source of News from Within. We are not, by nature, well equipped to see inside ourselves. Consciousness bobs like a small boat on a sea of disavowed emotions. A lot of feelings and ideas require a high degree of courage to confront. They threaten to make us uncomfortably anxious, excited or sad were we to learn more about them.\n\nSo we use the news from without to silence the News from Within. We have the most prestigious excuse ever invented not to spend too much time roaming freely inside our own minds. It is not that the news from without is unimportant to someone \u2013 it will be the most important thing in certain people\u2019s lives a continent away, or in a company in the capital, or somewhere in the upper reaches of government. It\u2019s just that this news is almost certainly disconnected from our real priority over the coming years, which is to make the most of our life and our talents in the time that remains to us. It is touching that we should give so much of our curiosity over to strangers, but it is poignant that we are forced eventually to pay such a high price for this constant dispersal of energy. We dismiss fragile, tentative thoughts about what we should do next, who we should call, what we really need to do \u2013 thoughts upon which an adequate future for us depends \u2013 for the sake of the more obvious drama of the moment. But the drama won\u2019t save us, and cares not a jot about our development or our real responsibilities.\n\nIt feels counter-intuitive to think that there might be certain things more important than the news. But there is: our own lives, which we have (troublingly) been granted such prestigious reasons and means to avoid confronting.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Philosophical Meditation",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Normality\n\nMost of us are rather interested in being normal. We want to belong, and worry about ways in which we don\u2019t. No matter how much we praise individualism and celebrate ourselves as unique, we are, in many areas, deeply concerned with fitting in.\n\nIt is therefore unfortunate that our picture of what is normal is very often way out of line with what is actually true and widespread. Many things that we might assume to be uniquely odd or disconcertingly strange about us are in reality completely average and ubiquitous, though rarely spoken of in the reserved and cautious public sphere.\n\nThe idea of the normal currently in circulation is not an accurate map of what is actually customary for a human being. Each one of us is far more compulsive, anxious, sexual, high-minded, mean, generous, playful, thoughtful, dazed and at sea than we are ever encouraged to admit.\n\nPart of the reason for our misunderstanding of our normality comes down to a basic fact about our minds: we know through immediate experience what is going on inside us, but only know about other people from what they choose to tell us, which will almost always be a very edited version of the truth.\n\nWe know what we\u2019ve done at 3am, but imagine others sleeping peacefully. We know our somewhat shocking desires from close up; we are left to guess about other people\u2019s from what their faces tell us, which is not very much.\n\nThis asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge- of-others is what lies behind loneliness. We simply can\u2019t trust that our deep selves can have counterparts in those we meet, so we stay silent and isolated. The asymmetry encourages shyness too, for we struggle to believe that the imposing, competent strangers we encounter can have any of the vulnerabilities and idiocies we\u2019re so familiar with inside our own characters.\n\nIdeally, the task of culture should be to compensate for the failings of our brains by assisting us to a more correct vision of what other people are normally like, by taking us, in a realistic but seductive way, into the inner lives of strangers. This is what novels, films and songs should constantly be doing: defining and evoking states of mind we thought we were alone in experiencing, in order to alleviate our shyness and loneliness.\n\nWe are particularly bad at recognising how normal it is to suffer and to be unhappy. Around relationships, for example, we constantly operate with an image of the bliss of others, which mocks and undermines our own efforts to keep going with many flawed but eminently \u2018good enough\u2019 unions. We find it hard to bear in mind that more or less everyone is, beneath a cheery surface, intermittently profoundly sad and rarely not anxious.\n\nWe become embarrassed too by our close-up knowledge of our own sexuality, which appears more perverse than that of anyone we know. It almost certainly isn\u2019t. We simply haven\u2019t been told the full story.\n\nIdeally, art works would offer us a hugely consoling truth: that our hidden worries, the nagging anxieties we keep close to our chests and our stranger thoughts and impulses don\u2019t actually make us strange; on the contrary, they are precisely what make us normal. One great goal of the love novel, for instance, should be to tell us what love and long-term relationships are really like so that our own tribulations do not appear so readily as signs that everything is going wrong, but rather that our sufferings are proof that we are in line with common human experience.\n\nOur culture often tries to project an idea of an organised, poised and polished self, as the standard way most people are. We should discount any such myth. Other people are always far more likely to be as we know we are, with all our quirks, fragilities, compulsions and surprising aspects, than they are to be like the apparently \u2018normal\u2019 types we meet in social life.\n\nSee also: Anxiety; Art, The Purpose of; Clumsiness; Confidence; Glamour; Good Enough; Inner Idiot, The; Jolliness; Loneliness; Lottery of Life; Politeness; Psychological Asymmetry; Sane Insanity; Sex and Love; Shyness; Ugliness; Vulnerability; Warmth.",

The reason why it tends to be experienced as so pleasurable is to be found at the psychological level: it can be ecstatic because it is bound up with the idea of extreme acceptance. Genitals are normally the most private part of ourselves, which we are careful to shield from others, for fear of being judged or of offending. Our mouths, by contrast, are highly visible and respectable elements, the gateway to language and of the expression of rational thought. For someone to allow our mouths to roam freely around their genitals is a supreme sign of having been given unusual access to their deeper selves. It is evidence of being intensely trusted and liked.\n\nA lot about our erotic excitement is bound up with a longing for closeness. Even when we do \u2018dirty\u2019 things (anal play, watersports, BDSM, etc.), the satisfaction is at heart to do with finding someone who is willing to lower their defences and let us into the most guarded spaces of their being.\n\nWe are constantly drawn to the idea that sex is primarily about the body but, at its core, sex is a psychological phenomenon. It is the delighted meeting of two previously isolated minds, enacted with the help of limbs and organs performing calculatedly rule-breaking manoeuvres.\n\nOral sex is exciting first and foremost as a promise of an end to loneliness.\n\nSee also: Loneliness.",

One central idea he developed was what he legendarily termed Peccatum Originale: original sin. Augustine proposed that human nature is inherently damaged and tainted because, in the Garden of Eden, Eve, the mother of all people, sinned against God by eating an apple from the Tree of Knowledge. Her guilt was then passed down to her descendants and now all earthly human endeavours are bound to fail because they are the work of a corrupt and faulty human spirit. This odd idea might not be literally true, of course. However, as a metaphor for why the world is in a mess, it has a beguiling poetic truth, as relevant to atheists as believers. We should perhaps not expect too much from the human race, Augustine implies. We have been somewhat doomed from the outset. And that can, in certain moods, be a highly redemptive thought to keep in mind.\n\nSee also: Tragedy.",

But we rarely feel personally agitated or wounded by their behaviour, because we don\u2019t assign a negative motive or mean intention to a small person. We reach for the most benevolent interpretations. We don\u2019t think they are doing it in order to upset us. We probably think that they are a bit tired, or that their gums are sore or they are upset by the arrival of a younger sibling. We have a large repertoire of alternative explanations ready in our heads, and none of these lead us to panic or become terribly agitated.\n\nThis is the reverse of what tends to happen around adults in general, and our lovers in particular. Here we imagine that others deliberately have us in their sights. If our partner is late for our mother\u2019s birthday because of \u2018work\u2019, we may assume it\u2019s an excuse. If they promised to buy us some extra toothpaste but then \u2018forgot\u2019, we\u2019ll imagine a deliberate slight. They probably relish the thought of causing us a little distress.\n\nBut if we employed the infant model of interpretation, our first assumption would be quite different: maybe they didn\u2019t sleep well last night and are too exhausted to think straight; maybe they have a sore knee; maybe they are doing the equivalent of testing the boundaries of parental tolerance. Seen from such a point of view, adult behaviour doesn\u2019t magically become nice or acceptable. But the level of agitation is kept safely low. It is very touching that we live in a world where we have learnt to be so kind to children; it would be even nicer if we learnt to be a little more generous towards the childlike parts of one another.\n\nAdulthood simply isn\u2019t a complete state; what we call childhood lasts (in a submerged but significant way) all our lives. Therefore, some of the moves we execute with relative ease around children must forever continue to be relevant when we\u2019re dealing with another grown-up.\n\nThe accurate, corrective reimagining of the inner lives of others is a piece of empathetic reflection we constantly need to perform with those around us. We need to imagine the turmoil, disappointment, worry and sheer confusion in people who may outwardly appear merely aggressive or mean.\n\nWe do our fellow adults the greatest possible favour when we are able to regard at least some of their bad behaviour as we would those of an infant. We are so alive to the idea that it\u2019s patronising to be thought of as younger than we are that we forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with \u2013 and forgive \u2013 the disappointed, furious, inarticulate or wounded child within.\n\nSee also: Androcles and the Lion; Charity of Interpretation; Inner Idiot, The; Loving and Being Loved; Universal Love.",

In response, a huge industry has grown up that advises us to consume more quinoa, pomegranate and fennel salad and, as often as we can, kale and apple soup. But this is to misunderstand why we start eating excessive amounts. It has nothing to do with food, and therefore trying to change our diet isn\u2019t the most logical place to focus our efforts. We eat too much because what we\u2019re really hungry for isn\u2019t available.\n\nWhen reaching for a tube of potato chips or biting into yet another burrito, the problem isn\u2019t our unconstrained appetite; rather, it is the difficulty we have in getting access to the emotional and psychological nutrients that would feed our broken souls \u2013 nutrients that include understanding, tenderness, forgiveness, reconciliation and closeness. We eat too much not because we are (as we brutally accuse ourselves) greedy, but because we live in a world where the emotional ingredients we crave are so elusive.\n\nA vast quantity of human ingenuity has been devoted to enticing the palate, and we have succeeded beyond our wildest expectations. But in the emotional arena, we have hardly begun to supply ourselves reliably with what we long to consume. If we could have ready access to sympathetic friendliness, warmer and calmer relationships with those we love, clearer knowledge of our true ambitions and better self-knowledge around our own failings, our waistlines would be under a lot less pressure.\n\nWe continue to eat, not because we are hungry, but because we cannot find anything more satisfying to absorb.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Emotional Capitalism.",

The sickness of perfectionism gestates in the fertile gap between our noble visions and our mediocre reality.\n\nYet our problems do not ultimately arise in our love of perfection per se. They lie in our reckless tendencies to under-budget for the difficulties of achieving it. The proper target for (gentle) criticism is premature perfectionism.\n\nHow accurately we budget for time and effort depends on a proper grasp of the inherent difficulty of any task. If we recognise something to be exceptionally arduous, we don\u2019t panic when our first efforts are weak and progress slow. It is difficult \u2013 but we knew it would be. High standards only become a problem when we think something might and should be substantially easier than it turns out to be, and when we read our struggles as marks of our own ineptitude rather than as an inevitable part of a legitimately lengthy journey.\n\nPerfectionism is only a problem because we have under- budgeted for difficulty, not because we are aiming high. It strikes when we imagine we might write a good novel in six months, or have a good career by the age of thirty, or have spontaneously worked out how to have a successful marriage.\n\nOur perfectionism starts to torture us when we lack information on how hard others had to work and how much they had to suffer before reaching their ideas of perfection. In the Utopia, our culture would endlessly draw to our attention the first drafts and hidden labours of others, and alert us to the true horrors exacted by anything worth doing.

Strange though it can sound, pessimism is one of the greatest sources of human serenity and contentment.\n\nThe reasons are legion. Relationships are rarely if ever the blissful marriage of two minds and hearts that Romanticism teaches us to expect; sex is invariably an area of tension and longing; creative endeavour is pretty much always painful, compromised and slow; any job \u2013 however appealing on paper \u2013 will be irksome in many of its details; children will always resent their parents, however well-intentioned and kindly the adults may try to be. Politics is evidently a process of muddle and unsatisfactory compromise.\n\nOur satisfaction in this life is critically dependent on our expectations. The greater our hopes, the greater the risks of rage, bitterness, disappointment and a sense of persecution.\n\nMany forces in our society conspire to stoke our hopes unfairly. Our commercial and political culture is tragically built upon the manufacture of promises of improbably beautiful scenarios. These forces tap into a natural, though profoundly mistaken, tendency of the human mind to think that the possession of hope must be the key to happiness (and kindness).\n\nLike optimists, pessimists would like things to go well. But by recognising that many things can, and probably will, go wrong, the pessimist is adroitly placed to secure the good outcome both of these parties ultimately seek. It is the pessimist who, having never expected anything to go right, tends to end up with one or two things to smile about.\n\nSee also: Anger; Anxiety; Cheerful Despair; Eudaimonia; Existential Angst; Perfectionism; Premeditation; Resilience; Sentimentality.",

We dimly experience a host of regrets, envious feelings, hurts, anxieties and resentments. But for the most part, we never stop to analyse or make sense of these. It seems too painful and difficult, because there is always an extra degree of anxiety that attends the process of beginning to think \u2013 whatever the eventual benefits.\n\nHowever, the weight of our unthought thoughts and unfelt feelings can grow unbearable over time. They take their revenge on us for not giving them the attention they deserve. They wake us up in the middle of the night demanding to be heard; they give us twitches and, one day perhaps, serious illnesses. These neglected feelings and thoughts deserve to be examined and unfurled, for they contain a host of clues as to our future direction and needs. They are not merely clutter, as they might seem under a Buddhist lens; they are the jumbled jigsaw pieces of a future, better self.\n\nIt is in order to get a handle on the contents of our minds that we require the practice of Philosophical Meditation. Philosophical Meditation proposes that we regularly set aside a portion of time and systematically set ourselves to answer in detail three core questions: What am I currently anxious about that I haven\u2019t properly acknowledged? What am I upset or hurt about that I haven\u2019t yet fully understood? And what am I currently excited about that I haven\u2019t yet clearly identified or had the courage to integrate into my ambitions?\n\nThe practice is built on the notion that our brains won\u2019t manage to understand their own content without a considerable degree of artifice and training. We need to establish habits that can regularly prompt us to undertake the arduous work of figuring out what is going on in our own minds.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Scepticism; Insomnia; News from Within",

Philosophy is the grand name given to the quest to lead a wiser life.\n\nAt the start of the history of philosophy, Socrates arrived at a novel approach to wisdom. He believed that a huge amount of suffering unfolds because of our inability to use our minds correctly. We don\u2019t analyse our emotions; we can\u2019t understand our past; we respond with undue haste to certain of our feelings. We haven\u2019t begun to understand ourselves.\n\nTo this end, he pioneered the basic tools of philosophy: self-analysis, logical examination, introspection, conversation and friendship.\n\nSocrates was the opposite of a disengaged academic: he believed that the only point of thinking was if it could be therapeutic, if it could help us to be slightly less agitated, confused and sorrowful individuals.\n\nThe aim of philosophy was \u2013 and still is \u2013 to help us cope better with our problems by introducing us to accurate and powerful ideas. Philosophy, as Socrates saw it, could be a School of Life.\n\nThis dictionary is philosophical in a precisely Socratic sense: it is a list of ideas strictly selected with regard to their usefulness in our lives.\n\nSee also: Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Self-Help Books; Wisdom.",

Under its dictates, we are urged to say that we\u2019ve had a nice evening when we haven\u2019t really or to tell someone we\u2019re delighted by news of their success, when in truth we\u2019d like them dead. Shouldn\u2019t we just be frank?\n\nThere are some deeply serious reasons why politeness matters. Proceeding politely through the world is founded on a recognition of how easy it is to get things wrong and therefore how important it is not to be quick to anger, not to burn bridges and not to make statements it will be hard to row back from. The polite recognise that their minds have great capacities for error and are subject to moods that will mislead them \u2013 and so are keen not to make statements that can\u2019t be taken back or to make enemies of people they might decide are in fact worthy of respect down the line.\n\nSceptical about themselves, polite people will suggest that an idea might be not quite right. They will say that a project is attractive but that it could be interesting to look at alternatives as well. They will consider that an intellectual opponent may well have a point. They aren\u2019t just lying or dodging tough decisions. Their behaviour is symptomatic of a nuanced and intelligent belief that few ideas are totally without merit, no proposals are one hundred per cent wrong and almost no one is entirely foolish. They work with a conception of the world in which good and bad are deviously entangled and in which bits of the truth are always showing up in unfamiliar guises in unexpected people. Their politeness is a logical, careful response to the complexity they identify in themselves and in the world.\n\nThe polite person also starts with a sense of the vulnerability of others. They know that many they encounter will be only millimetres away from inner collapse, despair and self-hatred. Every piece of neglect, every silence or slightly harsh or off-the-cuff word can have a profound capacity to hurt. So the polite person will be drawn to spend a lot of time noticing and commenting positively on apparently minor facets of others\u2019 achievements: they will say that the watercress soup was the best they\u2019ve had for years and that they\u2019d forgotten how much they liked it; they\u2019ll mention that the ending of the writer\u2019s new novel made them cry, and that work on the Mexico deal was particularly helpful to, and noticed by, the whole company.\n\nPoliteness is not an unnecessary cloak thrown over our innocent natural selves or a minor detail for a metropolitan dinner party: it is the bedrock of civilisation.\n\nSee also: Emotional Scepticism; Normality; Secrets in Love; Vulnerability.",

It promises that one may not have to choose between a satisfying sex life on the one hand, and a satisfying love life on the other. The two may be combined, by sleeping with and loving a succession of different people. Furthermore, there need be no reason for secrets. Everything one wants can be shared and combined.\n\nSadly, this promising philosophy has a tendency to forget certain deeply embedded and unfortunate facts about human nature. It overlooks how nice it is when something is fully ours and how worrying it can be when we can no longer make a powerful claim on a person we have learnt to trust. It ignores the pain of not being the centre of another\u2019s emotional life. It makes light of jealousy and turns possessiveness into a pathology, rather than an awful but stubborn fact.\n\nThe problem with polyamory is not the future it beckons us to.

      "content": "### \u00b6 Pop Music\n\nThe ultimate goal of philosophy is to become more like pop music. When pop music started in a big way in the 1960s, it seemed like an especially silly medium, favoured by hormonal schoolgirls and connected with delinquent and bizarre behaviour.\n\nBy contrast, philosophy had a reputation for being deeply serious and impressive \u2013 the natural home of the big ambition to understand ourselves and transform the world through ideas. But since the 1960s, philosophy has stalled and pop music has conquered the world. It is now the foremost medium for the articulation of ideas on a mass scale. This explains why, if it is to survive, philosophy must study pop; part of its salvation lies in understanding pop\u2019s techniques so as to be able to become, in crucial ways, a little more like it.\n\nThere are a host of critical lessons philosophy can learn from pop. For a start, pop teaches us about charm. The great pop songs are bewitchingly, dazzlingly charming in the manner in which they get their messages across; they know exactly how to wear away our defences and enter our imaginations with easy grace. It is a reminder that it isn\u2019t enough for ideas to be correct. For them to become powerful and deliver on their promises, they need to know how to win over an audience.\n\nPop is the most seductive force the world has ever known; it has more \u2013 and more devoted \u2013 adherents than all religions put together. It is more deeply loved, more trusted, and a more constant companion in our joys and sorrows than any other art form.\n\nPop has become powerful in part because it has cleverly understood the division of labour. Those who can sing and hold the crowd may not be the same as those who know how to write music or arrange instruments. Pop is unashamed about uniting talent wherever it finds it, so the final result can combine the most beautiful face with the finest voice, the best score and the most beguiling instrumental arrangement. Pop has overcome the Romantic hang-up about the unique creator; it knows that the most intimate, heartfelt result may be the outcome of large-scale institutional collaboration.\n\nPop teaches us too about compression. It knows our lives are busy and has an extraordinarily ambitious sense of what could be achieved in under three minutes. Like all other art forms, pop is trying to communicate ideas, but it bypasses the more resistant intellectual parts of the mind. All the usual obstacles to reaching another person are stripped away in the name of visceral intimacy. Pop achieves what Pericles, Lincoln, Dickens and Proust were attempting \u2013 and spectacularly surpasses them all. It provides the ultimate demonstration of the 19th-century theorist Walter Pater\u2019s tantalising assertion that \u2018All art aspires to the condition of music\u2019.\n\nLike religion, pop knows that repetition is key. It works its effect through being heard again and again. It would prefer to grab three minutes from you every day than three hours every two months. Like religious incantation, it is interested in working upon our souls cumulatively. Pop is intelligent enough not to be afraid of simplicity; it is also too wise to be held back by pedantry or erudition. It knows that our emotional needs are in essence obvious: to be encouraged, to be held, to be jollied, to be reassured when we are alone, to be told something beautiful and uplifting. It doesn\u2019t suffer from high art\u2019s perverse addiction to subtlety. It accepts that the core of our minds may be astonishingly basic in its structure.\n\nPop is ultimately the master of collective euphoria. It possesses what churches and politicians would like, but are so rarely able, to secure. It has worked out how to generate shared moments of deep emotion about important things. In the stadium, the singer functions as a high priest, for whom the flock might be ready to make major sacrifices; they would, in their benign frenzy, be willing to go anywhere.\n\nThat philosophy needs to learn from pop doesn\u2019t preclude that pop needs \u2013 of course \u2013 to learn quite a bit from philosophy as well. Pop currently touches on the big themes but doesn\u2019t, as yet, properly take up many of the opportunities that lie in its way. It is lacking in ultimate ambitions. In the future, we need pop musicians to take up the challenge of investigating the deepest truths, of getting behind transformative concepts and of making these into the things we\u2019ll sing about in front of the bathroom mirror with our hairbrushes so that they become the background sounds of our inner lives. The world waits for a redemptive synthesis between philosophy and pop.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Cultural Mining; Popularisation; Seduction.",

To describe someone as a \u2018good populariser\u2019 is to crush them with faint praise. A Romantic prejudice suggests that the mark of true genius is to be of deep interest only to a very few.\n\nYet the destiny of every properly good idea is to be popular, so the task of good thinking must include not just the formulation of good ideas, but also their powerful and seductive dissemination through society.\n\nThe noble populariser realises that sounding dense, hard to understand and elusive is almost always a sign of not having thought hard enough rather than of being a genius. The goal of the populariser is that their ideas should, after a time, start to sound like common sense. The populariser assumes it to be a more complex undertaking to make something sound obvious than to insist on its strangeness. They are more interested in the good of their audience than in their own reputations.\n\nFor democracies to succeed, they cannot afford to let good ideas be merely the preserve of the few. They need to democratise not just soap powder and airline travel, but widespread and constant access to the best thoughts and positions \u2013 so that tyranny and error can be kept at bay.

They look at some of the most conspicuously popular things (certain newspapers or television shows, for example) and see how shallow and misleading they are. From these examples, it\u2019s tempting to draw the conclusion that popularity in itself must be a wicked element.\n\nYet in a democracy, it\u2019s hugely important what happens to be popular. However beautiful and true an idea may be, if it isn\u2019t popular, it won\u2019t be of any consequence. Instead of condemning popularity, serious people should seek it.\n\nThe most successful items of popular culture make certain distinctive moves. They contain clues about how things and ideas get to be popular: they are funny; they intensify drama; they move fast; they are carnal; they never condemn their audiences; they speak from the heart; they are strongly emotional; they acknowledge our fantasies and our darker thoughts; they are direct; they are immensely charming. They are hugely aware of how easily attention is lost, so they seek to entice at every moment.\n\nThe currently unpopular, intellectual culture that is ambitious around serious issues faces two choices. Either it can continue to be unpopular, and therefore have very limited consequence in the world, or it can seek to learn the lessons of popularity. It can attempt to make its way into the inner lives of the widest, largest section of the population.\n\nTragically, our sophisticated culture has, in the main, repudiated all the moves that are essential to popularity. But the moves themselves do not corrupt. A truth doesn\u2019t become a falsehood for being presented in a sexier or more amusing way. The idea and the vehicle are distinct. Wisdom doesn\u2019t become stupidity because a lot of people embrace it. Rather than condemn popular culture, the high-minded should deftly attempt to steal its box of tricks.\n\nSee also: Cultural Mining; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Popularisation; Seduction; School of Life, The.",

It is a deliberate, artful, ritualised meditation on varied options for upcoming disasters.\n\nThe practice is based on the view that our minds are congenitally unable to face up to the risks we face and do us an enormous disservice through their sentimental, unexamined optimism, leaving us unprepared for the catastrophes that will inevitably come our way. A premeditation constitutes a deliberate attempt to bring our expectations into line with the troubles we face. It builds on a fundamental idea about anger: that we don\u2019t get angry simply because something bad has happened; we grow furious only when it is bad and unexpected.\n\nThe Stoic philosopher Seneca believed that the greatest service we can pay ourselves is to crush hope. Here is an example of a Senecan premeditation:\n\nThe wise will start each day with the thought: fortune gives us nothing which we can really own. Whatever has been built up over years is scattered and dispersed in a single day. No, he who has said \u201ca day\u201d has granted too long; an hour, an instant, suffices for the overthrow of empires. Look at your wrists, a falling tile could cut them. Look at your feet, a paving stone could render you unable to walk again. We live in the middle of things that have all been destined to be damaged and to die. Mortal have you been born, to mortals have you given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything.\n\nOf course, premeditation doesn\u2019t remove the bad things. But by getting us to admit, frankly and bravely, that we are likely to encounter hell one day, it can leave us a little less distraught when it eventually comes our way.\n\nIdeally, our culture would do some of the work of premeditation for us: it would constantly feed us \u2013 through a wise emotional education delivered via culture \u2013 certain realistic ideas about the sadly demanding and radically imperfect nature of existence. But until it can overcome its congenital sentimentality, we should take care never to start the day without our own private premeditation.\n\nSee also: Anger; Pessimism; Resilience; Sentimentality.",

Yet when it comes to others, we are restricted to knowing them through their public pronouncements, to what they can or choose to reveal. The hints and clues we are left to play with are hugely imperfect guides to the reality of another person\u2019s existence.\n\nThe result of this Psychological Asymmetry is that we almost always think of ourselves as far more peculiar, shameful and alarming than other people. Our experiences of anxiety, anger, envy, sex and distress appear to be so much more intense and disturbing than those of anyone in the vicinity. In truth, of course, we aren\u2019t really so odd; we just know a lot more about who we are.\n\nThe results of Psychological Asymmetry are loneliness and shyness. We are beset by loneliness because we cannot imagine that others long and desire, envy and hate, crave and weep as we do. We feel ourselves cast out into a world of strangers, inherently different from everyone we live alongside, and potentially offensive to all those who might know us properly. In dark moments, it appears that no one could possibly both know and like us.\n\nWe also become shy and are easily intimidated by people who we assume cannot share in our vulnerabilities and who we imagine would be entirely unable to relate to the petty, grand, perverse or idealistic thoughts that pass moment by moment through our minds. If we reach important positions, we feel like impostors, beset by an impression that our quirks separate us from others who have occupied comparable roles in the past. We grow boring and conventional, mimicking the externals of other people on the false assumption that this is what they might truly be like inside.\n\nThe solutions to Psychological Asymmetry lie in two places: art and love. Art provides us with accurate portrayals of the inner lives of strangers and, with grace and compelling charm, shows us how much they share in troubles and hopes we thought we might be alone in experiencing. And love gives us an occasional, deeply precious, sense of security to reveal who we really are to another person and the opportunity to learn about their reality from a position of secure proximity.\n\nTo overcome the effects of Psychological Asymmetry, we must trust that most people are far closer to what we are (that is, far shyer, more scared, more worried and more incomplete) than they are to resembling the personas they show to the world. Fortunately, none of us is quite as odd, or quite as special, as we might assume or fear.\n\nSee also: Impostor Syndrome; Loneliness; Normality; Shyness; Vulnerability.",

We may own the wealth of continents, but it has been ten years at least since we last had the chance to do nothing for a day.\n\nAt this point in history, we are so fixated on the idea that poverty must always be involuntary and therefore the result of lack of talent and indigence, we have trouble imagining that it might be the result of an intelligent and skilled person\u2019s free choice based on a rational evaluation of costs and benefits. It might sincerely be possible for someone to decide not to take the better-paid job, not because they had no chance, but because \u2013 having surveyed the externalities involved \u2013 they did not think them worth it.\n\nWhen we come to know the true price some ways of life exact, we may realise we are not willing to pay for the envy, fear, deceit and anxiety. Our days on earth are limited. For the sake of true riches, we may willingly, and with no loss of dignity, opt to become a little more reclusive, temperate and obscure.\n\nSee also: Bounded Work; Domesticity; Flowers; Small Pleasures.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Resilience\n\nOne of the characteristic flaws of our minds is to exaggerate how fragile we might be; to assume that life would be impossible far earlier than in fact it would be.\n\nWe imagine that we could not live without a certain kind of income, status or health; that it would be a disaster not to have a certain kind of relationship, house or job. This natural tendency of the mind is constantly stoked by life in commercial society. This kind of society goes to extraordinary lengths to make us feel that we really need to go skiing once a year, to have heated car seats, to fly in business class, to own the same kind of watch as a famous conductor, and to lay claim to lots of friends, perfectly muscular health and a loving, kind, sex-filled relationship.\n\nIn fact, our core needs are much simpler than this. We could manage perfectly well with very much less \u2013 not just around possessions, but across every aspect of our lives. It\u2019s not that we should want to, it\u2019s simply that we could. We could cope quite well with being rather poor, not being very popular, not having a very long life and with living alone. To put the extreme instance forwards, we could even cope with being dead; it happens all the time.\n\nBut we forget our resilience in the face of the risks we face. The cumulative effect of our innocence is to make us timid. Our lives become dominated by a fear of losing, or never getting, things that we could do perfectly well without.\n\nThe Ancient Roman philosopher Seneca had great success running what we would now call a venture capital firm. He owned beautiful villas and magnificent furniture. But he made a habit of regularly sleeping on the floor of an outhouse and eating only stale bread and drinking lukewarm water. He was reminding himself that it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to lose nearly everything, so as to free himself from nagging worries of catastrophe. The realisation gave him great confidence. He never worried so much about what might happen if a deal went wrong because, at the very worst, he\u2019d only be back on the kitchen floor next to the dog basket \u2013 which was OK in the scheme of things.\n\nSeneca was initiating an important move. By continually renewing our acquaintance with our own resilience \u2013 that is, with our ability to manage even if things go badly (getting sacked, a partner walking out, a scandal that destroys our social life, an illness) \u2013 we can be braver, because we grasp that the dangers we face are almost never as great as what our skittish imaginations tend to suggest.\n\nIn the Utopia, our culture would stop continually presenting us with rags to riches stories. It would instead do something far kinder and more conducive to the kind of courageous, entrepreneurial optimism our societies currently ineptly try to foster.\n\nOur culture would be continually presenting us with charming non-tragic tales of riches to rags stories, tales in which people lost money, partners and social standing but ended up coping rather well with their new lives. We\u2019d see them moving out of the penthouse into a humble cottage and having a fairly nice time tending to a small flowerbed and discovering tinned food. Our culture would not be recommending such scenarios, just lessening the grip upon us of certain deep but misplaced fears that so often hold us back from trying and succeeding.\n\nSee also: Anger; Cheerful Despair; Eudaimonia; Existential Angst; Faulty Walnut, The; Pessimism; Premeditation; Sentimentality; Ugliness.",

Novelty and change are centrally prestigious notions; we\u2019re eager to explore new places, ideas and opportunities. This attitude comes into particular focus around the status we accord to \u2018the news\u2019, a medium that fundamentally equates novelty with importance.\n\nCorrespondingly, we assume there could be nothing more ridiculous than repeating an old idea again and again. Repetition sounds boring and irksome, like the worst experiences of childhood education. But other cultures have taken a different and perhaps wiser view; they have had a high regard for repetition. They have created aesthetically compelling occasions where the same lesson has been rehearsed again and again. Across the globe and through time, it is particularly religions that have been concerned with getting people to repeat ideas. Zen Buddhists have looked at the moon every autumn and written poems in its honour on a set day; Jews will take time to appreciate spring according to a ritual requirement of their holy calendar; Catholics are required to ritually examine their consciences every Sunday; in Russia, Orthodox ritual demanded that before a long journey, everyone would meditate briefly on the possibility of never seeing each other again.\n\nWhat fired the religious devotion to ritual was the realisation that if the goal was to change minds and behaviour (and thereby change the world), once was never going to be enough.\n\nIn a secular age, the deep link between religion and ritual has served to cast the very concept of repetition into shadow. This is unfair. In the Utopia, the most important ideas would keep being reinforced via aesthetically compelling rituals. On a regular basis, we would be reminded of the importance of forgiveness, appreciation, self-knowledge and kindness. It\u2019s not that we ever actively disagree with such ideas; we simply forget to act upon them in practice. We need rituals to ensure that we properly listen to the significance of all the old things we half-know already, but avoid properly putting into practice nevertheless.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Memento Mori; Saints; Secularisation.",

It\u2019s not that we hate rocks; it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t normally find them very interesting. But in China things have been very different: for centuries, poets and artists have been obsessed with the varied charms of irregularly shaped and strikingly coloured lumps of stone.\n\nThe poet Mi Fu liked to pay compliments to a dramatically weathered rock and wrote tenderly about its resilience and dignity. The most favoured rocks were dark and glossy, quarried from the limestone of Lingbi, in the northern Anhui province. The best examples might cost as much as a house.\n\nUnder the influence of this tradition, we might start to pay a lot more admiring attention to the rocks we ourselves happen to come across. But we\u2019d have to go to China for this inspiration, because our culture doesn\u2019t offer us many prompts of encouragement in this rock direction. Our culture has, however, taken great pains to get us to see what might be nice about other things: the pleasures of fine dining, attending the Olympic opening ceremony or flying business class. But when we encounter the tradition of rock homage in China, we are alerted to how many other things still remain to be appreciated in a host of areas of life, if only we were invited to turn our gaze towards them and given a few guiding hints about what to look for.\n\nOur lives are, in part, a search for pleasure.

It is hard to go far on almost any issue without encountering a dominant Romantic position.\n\nAt the core of the Romantic attitude is a trust in feeling and instinct as supreme guides to life, and a corresponding suspicion of reason and analysis. In relation to love, this inspires a belief that passionate emotions will reliably guide us to a partner who can provide us with fifty years or so of intimate happiness. It also leads to a veneration of sex as the ultimate expression of love (a position that turns adultery from a problem into a disaster). In relation to work, the Romantic spirit leads to a faith in spontaneous \u2018genius\u2019 and a trust that all talented people will experience the pull of a vocation. In social life, Romanticism argues against politeness and convention and in favour of frankness and plain speaking. It assumes that children are pure and good, and that it is only ever society that corrupts them. Romanticism hates institutions and venerates the brave outsider who fights heroically against the status quo. It likes what is new rather than recurring. The Romantic spirit pits itself against analysis; it believes there is such a thing as \u2018thinking too much\u2019 (rather than just thinking badly). It doesn\u2019t favour logic or discourse. Music is its favourite artistic medium. It is offended by what is humdrum and ordinary and longs for the special, the rare, the distinctive and the exclusive. It likes revolution rather than evolution. The Romantic attitude disdains organisation, punctuality, clarity, bureaucracy, industry, commerce and routine. It admits that these things are necessary, but considers them \u2018un-Romantic\u2019: miserable impositions forced upon us by the unfortunate conditions of existence.\n\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People, 1830.\n\nAn invitation to Romanticism.\n\nThe supreme symbol of the Romantic attitude is Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s legendary painting Liberty Leading the People.\n\nRomanticism has its distinctive wisdom, but in many areas its central messages have become a catastrophic liability in our lives. They push us in decisively unhelpful directions; they incite unreal hopes, make us impatient with ourselves, discourage introspection, blind us to the dangers of obeying instinct in love and work, turn us away from our realities and lead us to lament the normal conditions of existence.\n\nThe huge task of our age is to unwind Romantic attitudes and replace them with an outlook that might, for the sake of symmetry and historical accuracy, be called Classical.\n\nSee also: Changing the World; Classical; FOMO; Genius.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Romantic Disappointment\n\nOften our partner isn\u2019t terrible in any big way but we feel a growing sadness about our relationship: they\u2019re not as focused on us as we\u2019d hoped; they don\u2019t understand us fully; they\u2019re preoccupied, a bit abrupt, not hugely interested in the details of our day; they call their friends rather than talk with us. We feel disenchanted and let down, and may start to think we\u2019re with the wrong person.\n\nThis sorrow has a paradoxical source: early childhood. At the best moments of childhood, a loving parent offered us extraordinary satisfaction. They knew when we were hungry or tired, even though we couldn\u2019t explain. They made us feel completely safe. They were enchanted by our smallest achievements. We were entertained and indulged.\n\nAs adults, we continue to be in thrall to this notion of being loved, and find our partners sorely wanting as a result. It\u2019s a natural but profoundly unfair comparison. For a start, our needs were so much simpler. We didn\u2019t need someone to trawl intelligently through the troubled corners of our minds and understand why it is necessary to see our aunt on Sunday, why it matters to us that the curtains harmonise with the sofa covers, or why bread must be cut with a proper bread knife. Our partner is stumbling in the dark around needs that are immensely subtle, far from obvious and very complicated to deliver on.\n\nSecondly, in the early days, none of it was reciprocal. The parent was intensely focused on caring for us, but they knew and totally accepted that we wouldn\u2019t engage with their needs. They didn\u2019t need us to ask them about their day or make sense of their anxieties.\n\nOur parents were probably kind enough to shield us from the burden that looking after us imposed on them: they maintained a reasonably sunny fa\u00e7ade until they retired to their own bedroom, at which point the true toll of their efforts could be witnessed (but by then we were asleep).\n\nThe source of our present sorrow is not, therefore, that our adult lovers are tragically inept or uniquely selfish. It\u2019s rather that we\u2019re judging our adult experiences in the light of a very different kind of childhood love. We are sorrowful not because we have landed with the wrong person, but because we have grown up.\n\nSee also: Love as Generosity; Loving and Being Loved.",

Marriages were cold, ruthless and almost wholly disconnected from the happiness of their protagonists.\n\nWhat replaced the Marriage of Reason was the Marriage of Instinct, an arrangement that dictated that feeling should be the supreme guide to the formation of good relationships. Passionate emotion became viewed as the ideal predictor of fifty years of conjugal happiness.\n\nWe have grown used to following our hearts. Unfortunately, only too often, these hearts prove troublingly deceptive and unreliable. Our instincts pull us not so much towards situations that will make us happy as situations that feel familiar, which might be quite a different thing.\n\nThis is because adult love intimately rehearses the themes of childhood love, and a great many of us learnt of love in childhood in less than ideal conditions. The love we tasted when we were small will likely have involved not only tenderness and affection but also (in some form or other) troublesome dynamics: there might have been depression, anger, withdrawal, abandonment, favouritism, a pressure to succeed, or a subtle call to fail.\n\nWhen we reach adulthood, our \u2018instinct\u2019 then has a habit of impelling us towards situations that echo the less than ideal themes of childhood: we seek to find people of similar emotional maturity to our childhood caregivers. This explains why we so often find ourselves rejecting candidates who might on paper be eminently well matched and mature. Yet we cannot muster enthusiasm, and complain that they are \u2018boring\u2019 or \u2018not sexy\u2019. What we may at a subliminal level mean is: simply not disturbed enough to make us suffer in the ways we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real.\n\nThe time has come to outgrow our veneration of \u2018instinct\u2019. We need relationships in which our feelings have been properly submitted to examination and brought under the aegis of a mature awareness of our long and always distinctively troubled psychological histories.\n\nSee also: Crushes; Emotional Scepticism; Faulty Walnut, The; Long-Term Love.",

But the religious tradition of saints encapsulates an important idea that isn\u2019t necessarily tied to religion at all.\n\nSaints were once identified and venerated by churches in an attempt to promote important ideas via the lives and characters of specific people. A saint might be famous for being very kind (like St. Francis of Assisi) or for staying cheerful in a demanding office job (like St. Philip Neri, whose catchphrase was \u2018Let me get through today\u2019); or a parent who was extremely patient with a difficult child (like St. Monica). The point about a saint wasn\u2019t simply that they were very good or holy, but that they had some specific and very important lesson to teach us.\n\nNowadays, we still hero-worship, but we focus on people who are unusually talented, powerful or beautiful. They have nothing in particular to impart to us, other than \u2013 unwittingly \u2013 to humiliate us for being so ordinary. The idea of a saint holds out a more realistic and wiser option: that we should channel admiration for others in directions that will help us manage our own lives better.\n\nThe decline in religious belief has not made the underlying thesis behind saints irrelevant. There is an idea within them that needs to be rescued. Human beings need role models. We shouldn\u2019t complain about or eradicate role models; we need to improve the genre, bringing a better sort of person to the fore of public consciousness. We need better celebrities rather than no celebrities.\n\nWe should take more seriously the task of creating \u2018good celebrities\u2019, versions of secular saints who demonstrate with seductive clarity virtues that need to be more prominent in society. As part of this venture, one might, for example, set up prizes to locate: \u2018The introvert who most successfully managed to communicate what he/she felt to their partner\u2019; \u2018The child who most generously forgave their parents\u2019; \u2018The worker who most intelligently defused infighting at the office\u2019, or, the most elusive target of all: \u2018The husband who best learnt to control his temper and say sorry.\u2019\n\nBeing good won\u2019t ever be the result merely of hearing lectures on the subject; it requires that we see goodness enacted in the lives of intermittently ordinary but profoundly charming and inspiring people all around us.\n\nSee also: Good Nationalism; Nagging; Ritual; Secularisation; Seduction.",

We have complex histories, we are heading towards the ultimate catastrophe, we are vulnerable to devastating losses; love will never go wholly well, the gap between our hopes and our realities will be cavernous. In the circumstances, what we should aim for is not sanity, but a wise, knowledgeable and self-possessed relationship to our manifold insanities, or what we might term \u2018Sane Insanity\u2019. The sane insane differ from the simply insane by virtue of the honest and accurate grasp they have on what is not entirely right with them. They may not be wholly balanced, but they don\u2019t have the additional folly of insisting on their normalcy. They can admit with good grace, and no particular loss of dignity, that they are rather peculiar in a myriad of ways. They do not go out of their way to hide from us what they get up to in the night, in their sad moments, when anxiety strikes, or during attacks of envy. At their best they can be dryly funny about the tragedy of being human. They lay bare the fears, doubts, longings, desires and habits that don\u2019t belong to the story we like to tell ourselves about sanity. They don\u2019t make ready confessions to let themselves off the hook or to be eccentric. They simply realise the unreasonableness of expecting to be reasonable all the time. They warn others as far as possible in advance of what being around them might involve, and apologise promptly for their failings as soon as they have manifested themselves. They offer their friends and companions accurate maps to their craziness, which is about the most generous thing one can do to anyone who has to endure us.

We will be able to come clean about so much that we had previously needed to keep to ourselves: our reservations about our friends; our irritation over small but wounding remarks by colleagues; our interest in rarely mentioned sexual practices. Love seems founded on the idea of radical disclosure.\n\nBut gradually, we stand to become aware of so much we cannot say. It might be around sex: on a work trip we flirted with a colleague and nearly let our hand touch theirs; we discovered a porn site that beautifully targeted a special quirk of our erotic imagination; we find our partner\u2019s brother or sister very alluring. Or the secret thoughts can be more broad-ranging: the blog they wrote for work, about their experience in client care, was very boring; they are putting on weight around their waist; their best friend from school, to whom they are still loyal, is (in our view) excessively silly and dull; in the wedding photo of their parents (lovingly displayed in a silver frame in the living room) their mother looks very smug.\n\nLove begins with a hope of unburdening ourselves entirely and overcoming loneliness forever. The initial relief of honesty is at the heart of the feeling of being \u2018in love\u2019. But this sharing of secrets sets up in our minds \u2013 and in our collective culture \u2013 a hugely problematic ideal: that if two people love one another, they must always tell each other the truth about everything.\n\nThe idea of honesty is sublime. It presents a deeply moving vision of how two people can be together, and it is a constant presence in the early months. But in order to be kind, and in order to sustain love, it ultimately becomes necessary to keep many thoughts out of sight.\n\nKeeping secrets can seem like a betrayal of the relationship. At the same time, the complete truth invariably places any union in mortal danger. Much of what we\u2019d ideally like to have recognised and confirmed is going to be genuinely disturbing even to someone who is fond of us.\n\nWe face a choice between honesty and acceptability and \u2013 for reasons that deserve a great deal of sympathy \u2013 mostly we choose the latter. We are perhaps too conscious of the bad reasons for hiding something; we haven\u2019t paid enough attention to the noble reasons why, from time to time, true loyalty may lead us to say very much less than the whole truth. We are so impressed by honesty that we have forgotten the virtues of politeness \u2013 this word defined not as a cynical withholding of important information for the sake of harm, but as a dedication to not rubbing someone else up against the true, hurtful aspects of our nature. It is ultimately no great sign of kindness to insist on showing someone our entire selves at all times. Repression, a certain degree of restraint and a dedication to editing our pronouncements belong to love as much as a capacity for explicit confession. The person who cannot tolerate secrets, who in the name of \u2018being honest\u2019 divulges information so wounding it cannot be forgotten, is no friend of love. We should accept an ongoing need to edit our full reality.\n\nSee also: Infidelity; Politeness; Polyamory; Sex and Love.",

Almost all of the world\u2019s most developed countries have, over the past century, undergone a significant process of secularisation. Religions that were once immensely influential across the whole of society now usually have only tiny bands of faithful adherents.\n\nIt might be assumed that secularisation logically involves one thing only: proving the non-existence of a god and then ridding the world of everything related to religion.\n\nBut there may be a different way to approach secularisation \u2013 a nuance that relates back to the dual identity of religions. Aside from their grandly speculative notions about the origins of the universe and the survival of the soul after death, religions have also been the carriers of a range of useful and important psychological ideas. Religions have been engaged in two tasks: to make us faithful and to make us wise.\n\nFor long periods of history, religions were involved not only in metaphysical speculations, but also in what we would now call emotional education. They foregrounded forgiveness, charity, community, ritual gratitude, honesty about one\u2019s failings, generosity towards the weak and a rejection of money as the ultimate measure of the worth of individuals.\n\nReligions were also astonishingly inventive about how to bring this emotional education about. They didn\u2019t just deliver dry lectures in ugly classrooms. They deployed the greatest artists in the world to make their views of the well-lived life seductively convincing; they built the finest buildings and commissioned the greatest art in an attempt to get difficult messages about kindness, generosity, humility and sorrow to lodge firmly in our souls. They mined the power of ritual: they realised how repetition, rules, special clothes, sacred foods and days, words and gestures might help our leaky brains retain important ideas.\n\nThe true task of secularisation is to steal from the educational techniques of religions while disregarding (most of) their content. Religions are intermittently too creative, interesting and useful to be abandoned merely to those who happen to believe in them. The priority is to rescue some of what is still wise, inspiring and relevant from all that is no longer true.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Day of Judgement; Emotional Capitalism; Emotional Education; Monasteries; Ritual; Saints; Seduction; Self-Help Books.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Seduction\n\nSeduction is the attempt to get any set of tricky ideas into the mind of another person using the arts of charm. Although we know the concept of seduction well enough in romantic contexts, the manoeuvre is of huge relevance far beyond this. Managing employees requires seduction; instilling discipline in children requires seduction; and leading a country involves seduction.\n\nUnfortunately, the idea of \u2018seduction\u2019 has acquired a bad name. If a book is charmingly written, if a song makes people want to dance, if a product is well marketed, if a person has a winning smile and sweet manners, suspicions develop only too easily.\n\nYet the idea of seduction is vital to any educational mission, for the ideas that we most need to hear are almost always the ones that we would in some ways like to ignore, and therefore need maximal help in absorbing.\n\nWe need the toughest lessons to be coated in the most subtle and inventive charm. We need an alliance of education and seduction.\n\nAt certain historical moments, the point has been well heeded. The central philosopher of the Renaissance, Marsilio Ficino, wished to teach the population of Florence to live according to the highest principles of virtue and intelligence. But he also knew the human mind well; he understood that it was no use delivering lectures if genuine change on a large scale was required. Therefore, he persuaded his patrons, the wealthy Medici family, to harness the seductive skills of Italy\u2019s finest artists to a broad and subtly concealed educational programme.\n\nMagnificent buildings and sensuously appealing works of art were allied to the noblest lessons of Classical and Biblical authors. Madonnas on altarpieces became not only kind and gentle-looking, but also plainly rather sexy, for \u2013 as Ficino knew \u2013 we have a habit of listening a little more closely when the person speaking to us is someone we might subliminally want to undress.\n\nMichelangelo, David, 1501\u201304.\n\nThis strikingly handsome nude statue helped to deliver a key intellectual message about political independence in Renaissance Florence in a seductive way.\n\nAltar in the pilgrimage church of the Fourteen Holy Saints, Wallfahrtskirche Vierzehnheiligen, Bavaria. Constructed 1743 \u20131772.\n\nThe lavishly decorated interior of this church helped seduce people into accepting the messages preached within it \u2013 or so hoped the preachers, anyway.\n\nWhen Michelangelo (Ficino\u2019s pupil) placed his statue David in front of the government building in Florence, it was the sexiest, most alluring statue Europe had witnessed since the fall of Rome. David looked irresistible, but he was also the carrier of a key intellectual argument, derived from Cicero, about how the independence of a state must be founded on the capacity for courage and sacrifice.\n\nSimilarly, in 18th-century Bavaria, moralist preachers wanted to promote compassion for the suffering of strangers, sorrow for our own selfishness and the spiritual significance of Jesus\u2019s view of existence. But they were conscious of how easily we might ignore such ideas in already busy and tricky lives. So, very deliberately, they set out to seduce.\n\nWith the help of the finest Baroque architects, they constructed ornate and richly carved churches that provoked admiration, awe and love. It became a little easier to believe in the ideas that had sponsored these masterpieces after a few hours under their magnificent domes.\n\nThe urge to nag is very understandable, especially when a lesson is important. But sadly, nagging \u2013 the insistent, urgent, graceless repetition of a message \u2013 will only ever work for a small number of people who are almost on side anyway. It cannot change humanity.\n\nThis sets up a tragic situation: what naggers have to say may be supremely important, but their manner of delivery ensures it will never be heard.\n\nSeduction can always be used in the service of nefarious ends. But in the Utopia, there would be strategic alliances between the deepest, most sincere, thinkers and the most seductive voices and creators. Seductive techniques would be carefully deployed to make sure that what really mattered reliably worked its way into the hearts and minds of pretty much everyone.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Art, The Purpose of; Art and News; Changing the World; Cultural Mining; Glamour; Memento Mori; Nagging; Pop Music; Popularisation; Popularity; Saints; Secularisation; State Broadcasting; Teaching and Learning.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Self-Help Books\n\nThere is no more ridiculed literary genre than the self-help book. Intellectually minded people universally scorn the idea of them. Self-help books don\u2019t appear on reading lists at any prestigious university; they\u2019re not reviewed by highbrow journals, and it\u2019s inconceivable that a major literary prize could ever be awarded to one of their authors.\n\nThis concerted attack on the entire genre of self-help is a symptom of a Romantic prejudice against the idea of emotional education. Offering explicit emotional education is regarded as beneath the dignity of any serious writer. If we are at all intelligent, we should know how to live already.\n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the quality of self-help books is at present highly degraded. The most accomplished stylists and sharpest thinkers would feel ashamed to put their name to a work that would be destined to end up on the most mocked shelves of any bookshop.\n\nYet not all eras have shared this dismissive attitude. In the Classical culture of Ancient Greece and Rome, it was taken for granted that the highest ambition of any author was to offer the reader an emotional education that could guide them towards fulfilment (eudaimonia). Self-help books were at the pinnacle of literature. The most admired thinkers \u2013 Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius \u2013 all wrote self-help books, whose aim was to teach us to live well and die well. Furthermore, they deployed every resource of intelligence, wit and style in writing their manuals to ensure that their messages would delight readers\u2019 intellectual as well as emotional faculties. Seneca\u2019s On Anger and Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations are among the greatest works of literature of any nation or era. They are also, undeniably, self-help books.\n\nIt can look as if humans stopped writing good self-help after the Fall of Rome. But once we view culture as a tool for emotional education, many more works emerge as belonging to the currently much-maligned genre. For example, Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace explicitly aims to teach compassion, calm and forgiveness; it offers guidance around money, manners, relationships and career development; it seeks to show us how to be a good friend and how to be a better parent. It clearly is a self-help book \u2013 it just isn\u2019t officially described this way by the current guardians of culture. Similarly, Marcel Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time is a self-help book, teaching us how to surrender our attachment to romantic love and social status in favour of a focus on art and ideas.\n\nIt is not an insult to describe masterpieces as self-help books. It is a way of correctly identifying their ambitions, which are to guide us away from folly towards more sincere and authentic lives. Such works show us that self-help shouldn\u2019t be a low-grade marginal undertaking and that the desire to guide and teach wisdom is at the core of all ambitious writing.\n\nIn the bookstores of the Utopia, the self-help shelves would be the most prestigious. On them would sit the most distinguished works of world literature \u2013 returned, at last, to their true home.\n\nSee also: Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Culture Can Replace Scripture; Emotional Education; Eudaimonia; Philosophy; Secularisation.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Self-Knowledge\n\nOne of the most striking features of our minds is how little we understand them. Although we inhabit ourselves, we seldom manage to make sense of more than a fraction of who we are. It can be easier to master the dynamics of another planet than to grasp what is at play in the folds of our own brains.\n\nInstances of self-ignorance surprise and perturb us at regular intervals: on certain days, we can be irritable or sad without any idea why. Or we may feel lost in our career, but be unable to say more than that we wish to \u2018do something creative\u2019 or \u2018help make the world a better place\u2019 \u2013 plans so vague that they leave us perilously vulnerable to the more robust ambitions of others.\n\nIt has been the achievement of psychology to instil in us a sense of a basic division between two parts of the mind \u2013 the conscious and the unconscious; between what is immediately accessible to us and what lies in shadow, and will surprise us in symptoms, dreams, slips of the tongue and diffuse anxieties, longings and fears. It has also been the work of psychology to insist that maturity must involve a constant drive to turn what is unconscious conscious: to help us master the art of self-knowledge.\n\nWe need not blame ourselves for our poor grasp of our own minds. The problem is inherent in the very architecture of the brain, an organ that evolved over millennia for the sake of rapid, instinctive decision-making \u2013 not the patient, introspective sifting of ideas and emotions.\n\nBut a degree of emotional squeamishness is also responsible for our failure to look inside. A lot of what is unconscious is tricky material that we long not to have to look at too closely. For example, we may feel troublingly angry towards people we thought we loved. We may be more ruthless and envious than nice people are ever meant to be. We may have to make enormous changes to our lives, but prefer the ease of the status quo. Across childhood, we may have had instilled in us, so subtly that we didn\u2019t even notice, strong notions about what are and are not normal things to experience. We may have picked up covert but forceful indications that no decent person (no one loved by their parents, at least) could be unable to cope at work, tempted by an affair or still upset over a break-up that happened three years ago. Most of our sexual desires still have no place in our standard understanding of respectability.\n\nWhen difficult feelings do threaten to emerge, the light of consciousness can be counted upon to take fright and shine its beam elsewhere. By failing to investigate the recesses of the mind, we carefully protect our self-image and can continue to think rather well of ourselves. But we don\u2019t escape from the job of introspection lightly. There is almost always a high price to pay for our reluctance to look within. Feelings and desires that haven\u2019t been examined tend not to leave us alone. They linger and spread their energy randomly to neighbouring issues. Ambition that doesn\u2019t know itself comes out as anxiety. Envy comes out as bitterness; anger turns into rage; sadness into depression. Disavowed material buckles and strains the system. We develop pernicious tics: a facial twitch, impotence, an incapacity to work, alcoholism, a porn compulsion. Most so-called \u2018addictions\u2019 are at heart symptoms of insistent difficult feelings that we haven\u2019t found a way to address. Insomnia is revenge for thoughts we have refused to have in the day.\n\nStrangers to ourselves, we end up making bad choices: we exit a relationship that might have been at heart quite workable. We don\u2019t explore our own professional talents in time. We alienate friends through erratic and off-putting behaviour. We lack insight into how we come across to others and appal or shock. We buy the wrong things and go on holiday to places that have little to do with what we really enjoy. It is no coincidence that Socrates should have boiled down the entire wisdom of philosophy to one simple command: know yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s a distinctly odd-sounding ambition. Society has no shortage of people and organisations offering to guide us around distant continents, but very few that will help us with the arguably far more important task of travelling around the byways of our minds.\n\nFortunately, there are a number of tools and practices that can help us to reach inside our minds and move us from dangerous vagueness to challenging but redeeming clarity.\n\nSee also: Philosophical Meditation; Unprocessed Emotion.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Self-Sabotage\n\nIt is normal to expect that we will always actively seek out our own happiness in relationships and careers, yet we often act as if we were deliberately out to ruin our chances. When going on dates, we may lapse into unnecessarily opinionated and antagonistic behaviour. In relationships, we may drive well-intentioned partners to distraction through repeated unwarranted accusations and angry explosions. At work, we may stumble before the biggest chances.\n\nSuch behaviour can\u2019t always be put down to mere bad luck. It may deserve a stronger, more intentional term: Self-Sabotage. We destroy our opportunities because of a background sense that success is undeserved; this breeds a compulsion to bring our outer reality into line with our inner one, so that we end up being as unsuccessful as we feel.\n\nHope is hard for self-saboteurs to endure. It may feel internally easier to destroy one\u2019s happiness oneself, at a time of one\u2019s own choosing, rather than to wait for circumstances to do the trick for one (as they surely will), when one is unprotected and trusting. Failing feels grim but \u2013 at least \u2013 safely grim.\n\nOur sense of what we deserve emerges from childhood. When we carry about with us a legacy of not quite having a right to satisfaction, the good will of others may prove bewildering and inspire unconscious attempts to repel or disappoint it self-destructively. It will simply feel more normal and therefore comfortable to be disliked or ignored.\n\nOr we may, when we were younger, have been exposed to exceptionally brutal disappointments at a time when we were too fragile to withstand them. Perhaps we hoped our parents would stay together and they didn\u2019t. Or we hoped our father would eventually come back from another country and he stayed away. Perhaps we dared to love an adult and, after a period of happiness, they swiftly and oddly changed their attitude and let us down. Somewhere in our characters, a deep association has been forged between hope and danger, along with a corresponding preference to live quietly with disappointment, rather than more freely with hope.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves that we can, despite our fears, survive the loss of hope. We are no longer those who suffered the disappointments responsible for our present timidity. The conditions that forged our caution are no longer those of adult reality. The unconscious mind may, as is its wont, be reading the present through the lenses of decades ago, but what we fear will happen has in truth already happened; we are projecting into the future a catastrophe that belongs to a past we have not had the chance to fathom and mourn adequately.\n\nWe are suffering from an enduring localised immaturity: an archaic part of us remains as it was when we were young. It has not been able to grow and shed its terrors. The intensity of fear is based on the idea that we can only bring childhood resources to the problem. We still feel the same age as when we met a horrendous loss.\n\nBut in fact, we\u2019re big now. We have the capacity to cope very well. Should this relationship fail, should this job not work out, should our hopes not be met, we\u2019ll be sad for a while but won\u2019t be destroyed. We are not in as much danger as the primitive part of the mind thinks \u2013 and as we once were. The catastrophe is behind us.\n\nIf happiness has not been a big part of our history, we should be conscious of how hard or unnerving it may prove to get close to some of the things we truly want.\n\nSee also: Inner Voices.",

This is rarely effective, however. By heightening the sense of threat, harshness simply invites a stronger reaction of defensive denial.\n\nA major ambition of a good culture should be to make the truth bearable.

Few of us explicitly view ourselves as being concerned with service. We are encouraged to think that we are primarily selfish creatures.

When this feeling is unavailable, no amount of money may be able to compensate \u2013 and when it is very present, not even a negligible income can distract us.\n\nSome work fits the requirement for service with ease: the nurse and the cardiac surgeon are in no doubt that they are of service. But there are less dramatic yet equally essential forms of service-related satisfaction to be found in a range of less obvious tasks: sanding someone\u2019s floor; making efficient toothpaste dispensers; clearing up the accounts; delivering letters; helping someone to improve their backhand.\n\nWhen work is of service, we can trace a connection between the things we do and a modest but real contribution to the improvement of humankind. It would be rather simple if all we wanted from work was money. However, we want something far more ambitious and far more complicated: the feeling of having made a difference.\n\nSee also: Meaningful Work; Misemployment.",

This can appear nothing short of a catastrophe, a sign of monstrous failure and very often a prelude to a break-up.\n\nYet the problem is not ours alone. It is simply that almost everything that can make love go well seems primed not to make sex go well, and vice versa. We are afflicted by a fundamental misalignment in the qualities of character and spirit required by good sex on the one hand and successful love on the other.\n\nA relationship cannot survive in the long term without tenderness, soberness, practical intelligence and selective resignation. We have to carefully fathom another\u2019s motives, explain our moods, overcome hurts and sulks and assume a mantle of predictability.\n\nSex, on the other hand, in its most dramatic, thrilling versions, demands that we be heedless, decadent, perhaps cruel or untenably submissive. It can involve the crudest language and moments of beautiful, tender degradation.\n\nIn having to suffer from feelings of inadequacy around what happens in long-term love, we are the victims of major cultural failure: the failure of our surrounding culture to continually stress a realistic picture of an unavoidable tension between two crucial yet incompatible themes of existence.\n\nIn a wiser world, we would collectively admit that the very rare cases where love and sex did run together were astonishing exceptions with no relevance to the majority of lives. We would instead learn to pay admiring attention to those who had accepted with a reasonable show of dignity and grace that the natural price of long-term togetherness is a decline in the quality and frequency of sexual contact \u2013 and that this is, in many cases, a price worth paying.\n\nSee also: Infidelity; Long-Term Love; Normality; Polyamory; Secrets in Love; Sexual Fetishes; Sexual Liberation.",

They are commonly frowned upon and understood as either entirely mysterious or very sinister. They are neither. They are closely connected with the deepest strands in our personalities and reflect some of our most sincere commitments and beliefs.\n\nThe things that turn us on are, at heart, almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we\u2019d like things to be. They are small moments of Utopia enacted around points of our sexuality.\n\nConsider, for example, the fetish for rough sex. Modern life demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. But in our hearts, we might like to be very forceful occasionally, exploring a demanding and insistent side to us. We would like sometimes to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But in the real world, of course, this is made difficult by the fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status that would allow us to exercise power as we would want.\n\nIn our fetish, we dream that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint, no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fetish, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person.\n\nOr consider the fetish for outdoor sex. We easily become shy about the public realm; we sense that we have to be guarded, on our best behaviour, out there in the elevators, public plazas, shopping centres and garage forecourts of the world. Even nature is seen as quite hostile \u2013 a cold, dangerous place where enemies may set upon us.\n\nSo the longing arises that we could be as much at ease in the outdoors, in public and in nature, as we can be at home. It would be a solution to a kind of oppression to have sex in the elevator, in the library stacks, out near the river \u2026 Sex outdoors is pleasurable for the same reasons as picnics are: they are ways of taming the world by taking the domestic out into it. Any activity that has become linked to the indoors can be blissful when done outside because it symbolises a conquest of our anxieties \u2013 it is a way of imagining being more at home in the world than we normally can be.\n\nOne can analyse almost any fetish (shyness, cardigans, flat shoes, boots, cigars, stockings, striped socks, etc.) and find similar structures: an anxiety and a corresponding longing, to which an erotic charge has become connected. Looked at like this, sexual scenarios can be explained to ourselves \u2013 and, crucially, to other people in our lives \u2013 in rational, sensible terms.\n\nBy talking like this, we can hope that sexual fetishes will become a little less shameful and a little less threatening \u2013 and our erotic solutions a bit more reasonable and, in their own way, a lot more logical.\n\nSee also: Sex and Love; Sexual Liberation.",

Stand-up comics can make jokes about masturbation, women\u2019s sexual appetites have been recognised, bathrooms are designed to feel airy and open. Yet the notion that we are liberated causes us problems all of its own, because it brings with it the assumption that hang-ups and awkwardness can no longer legitimately exist.\n\nIn truth, of course, true liberation remains a radically unfinished project; \u2018unfinished\u2019 because we continue to struggle to admit key things about who we are from a sexual perspective. This becomes especially painful around relationships, given that, for many of us, the dream of love is that we will at last be able to admit to who we are sexually without embarrassment. Yet the reality is more awkward. We frequently find ourselves facing an apparent choice between being honest and being liked.\n\nThe choice is not good for us. The sense that we need to hide, deny and bury away key elements of who we are is not, overall, very good for us. When we repress things that are important, they make themselves heard in other ways. As psychoanalysis has revealed, the \u2018dirty\u2019 parts of ourselves can show up disguised as greed, harsh opinions, bad temper, alcoholism or other forms of risky, damaging behaviour. There is a high price to disavowing powerful parts of ourselves: our sexuality can become split from our more enduring relationships. We may lose potency and desire with those we love, so unacceptable does our sexuality appear to be to us, so at odds with our higher feelings. Freud first noted this pattern in early 20th-century Vienna: \u2018Where they love, they cannot desire. Where they desire, they cannot love.\u2019\n\nTrue sexual liberation or self-acceptance doesn\u2019t have to mean abandoning all control or deliberately flaunting our less elevated needs at every turn. We don\u2019t have to fully embrace every impulse: we still need privacy and bathroom doors; we just need to be able to admit in an unfrightened way to ourselves and at points to our partners who we really are.\n\nThe core point of true liberation is to reduce the unfair and debilitating burden of shame with which we continue to wrestle only too often. Our goal should be to adopt a mature perspective on our own sexuality and to increase opportunities for moments of courageous and relationship-enhancing honesty.\n\nSee also: Better Porn; Sex and Love; Sexual Fetishes.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Shyness\n\nShyness is a consequence of a paralysing and yet always mistaken impression of the difference between ourselves and other people. In the kindest way, it is a symptom of the provincialism of our minds.\n\nAt shy moments, we are overwhelmed by a sense of the otherness of others. They are all women, and we are a man. They are rich and we are poor. They are from the north, and we\u2019re from the south. The obstacles appear insurmountable.\n\nThe way past them is to recall that each of us has both a local and a universal identity. The local identity comprises age, gender, skin colour, sexuality, social background, career and religion. But this is not the limit of who we are. Within our universal identity is the fact that we all have problematic families, have all been disappointed, have all been idiotic, have all been loved, have all been hated, have all had problems around sex, have all had anxieties \u2013 and will all bleed if we are pricked. The last point alludes to Shylock\u2019s haunting plea in Shakespeare\u2019s The Merchant of Venice:\n\nI am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?\n\nShylock\u2019s words are relevant not only to a prejudiced audience. They are of huge potential benefit to the shy as well. However unbelievable it may seem at nervous moments, we invariably have much in common with any member of our species. It is no coincidence that Shakespeare had read and absorbed the writings of the Roman playwright Terence, who is remembered for his declaration: Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (\u2018I am human, nothing human is foreign to me\u2019).\n\nAt times when we cannot help but doubt this concept, when we can readily see no echo of any of our concerns in the faces of others, we must make a social leap of faith:\n\nEven though the person I see in front of me seems alien in a hundred ways, even though I can currently notice no points of similarity, this cannot be true. There will, and has to be, a shared universal humanity, which it is within my powers to discover.\n\nSee also: Normality; Psychological Asymmetry; Sane Insanity; Universal Love; Warmth.",

Our age believes in big pleasures. We have inherited a Romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find, exotic, or unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. We subtly like high prices. If something is cheap or free, it\u2019s a little harder to appreciate. We are mostly focused on large schemes that we hope will deliver substantial enjoyment: marriage, career, travel and the purchase of a house.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t wholly wrong, but it unwittingly exhibits a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary, the familiar and the small-scale.\n\nThe paradoxical aspect of pleasure is how promiscuous it proves to be. It doesn\u2019t neatly collect in the most expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us on grand holidays. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods.\n\nA pleasure may look very minor \u2013 eating a fig, whispering in bed in the dark, talking to a grandparent, or scanning through old photos \u2013 and yet be anything but. If properly grasped and elaborated upon, these sorts of activities may be among the most moving and satisfying we can have.\n\nAppreciating what is to hand isn\u2019t a defence of failure; it isn\u2019t an attack on ambition. But there is no point in chasing the future until and unless we are attuned to the modest moments and things that are available to us already.\n\nThe smallness of a pleasure isn\u2019t really an assessment of how much it has to offer us: it is a reflection of how many good things the world unfairly neglects. A small pleasure is a great pleasure in waiting; it is a true source of joy that has not yet received the collective acknowledgment it is due.\n\nSee also: Domesticity; Getting an Early Night; Rock Appreciation; Quiet Life, The; Water Towers.",

In the past, snobs might have wanted to know a person\u2019s family lineage; now, they are focused on what they do for a living, and then judge their entire worth upon this piece of information. One of the first questions that a snob may ask of a stranger at a party is, \u2018And what do you do?\u2019 According to how the question is answered, they will either grow solicitous and animated, or will abandon the unfortunate low-status figure to a solitary fate by the nuts.\n\nThe more prevalent snobbery happens to be, the more our income and status start to matter. We are not being materialistic; we simply recognise that certain emotional rewards (a feeling of being valued, respected, honoured) will only be available to us via material goods. It isn\u2019t the material goods we want so much as the \u2018love\u2019 that results from their possession.\n\nIn principle, the snob is asking an important question: how impressive or good is a person? But they are brutally misguided in how they set about answering it. For snobs, it is the already acclaimed and already successful who are the only ones worthy of respect. There is no room to imagine that someone might be clever, kind or good, and yet have somehow been entirely overlooked by society. Snobs don\u2019t sign The Beatles, don\u2019t invest in the startup iteration of Google or Apple, don\u2019t give the time of day to the taxi driver who might one day be the president, or to the old lady in a woolly hat who is writing the great novel of the 21st century \u2013 or might simply be a rather lovely person.\n\nThe true answer to snobbery is not to say that there is no such thing as a better or worse person, but to insist that \u2018better or worse\u2019 exist in constantly unexpected places and carry none of the outward signs of distinction. Because we are such poor judges of the worth of others, our ultimate duty remains to be kind, good, curious and imaginative about pretty much everyone who might ever cross our path.\n\nSee also: Day of Judgement; Love as Generosity; Meritocracy.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Specialisation\n\nThe modern economy demands, and rewards, specialisation. The reason why was first elaborated at the end of the 18th century by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. In The Wealth of Nations (1776), Smith explained how specialisation \u2013 what he termed the \u2018division of labour\u2019 \u2013 decisively increases collective productivity. In a society where everyone does everything, only a small number of shoes, houses, nails, bushels of wheat, horse bridles and cart wheels are ever produced, as no one ends up especially good or efficient at producing anything. But if people specialise in just one small area (making rivets, shaping spokes, manufacturing rope, bricklaying, etc.), they become much faster and more efficient and the overall level of production is greatly increased. By focusing our efforts, our societies grow wealthier and better supplied with the goods they need. It is a tribute to the world Smith foresaw that we have ended up with highly specialised job titles such as Senior Packaging & Branding Designer, Intake and Triage Clinician, Research Centre Manager, Risk and Internal Audit Controller and Transport Policy Consultant \u2013 in other words, tiny cogs in giant efficient machines.\n\nDespite all this, we are at grave risk of getting bored. Deep in our hearts, most of us long to be wide-ranging, endlessly curious generalists. We can understand the origins of this restlessness when we look at childhood. As children, we were allowed to do so much. In a single Saturday morning, we might put on an extra jumper and imagine being an Arctic explorer, then have brief stints as an architect making a Lego house, a rock star making up an anthem about cornflakes and an inventor working out how to speed up colouring-in by gluing four felt-tip pens together. We\u2019d put in a few minutes as a member of an emergency rescue team, then we\u2019d try out being a pilot brilliantly landing a cargo plane on the rug in the corridor; we\u2019d perform a life-saving operation on a knitted rabbit, and finally we\u2019d find employment as a sous-chef helping to make a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch.\n\nEach one of these \u2018games\u2019 might have been the beginning of a career, yet we had to settle on only a single option, done repeatedly over fifty years. We are so much more than the world of work ever allows us to be. We have chosen to make work pay more rather than be more interesting. It\u2019s a sombre thought, but a consoling one too. Our suffering is painful but has a curious dignity to it, because it does not uniquely affect us as individuals. It applies as much to the CEO as to the intern, to the artist as much as to the accountant. Everyone could have found so many versions of happiness that will elude them. In suffering in this way, we are participating in the common human lot. Whatever we do, parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and die without having had the chance to come to full maturity \u2013 for the sake of the genuine benefits of focus and specialisation.\n\nSee also: Communism; Meaningful Work.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Splitting and Integration\n\nThe pioneering mid-20th-century Viennese psychoanalyst Melanie Klein drew attention to something very dramatic that happens in the minds of babies during feeding sessions with their mothers. When feeding goes well, the baby is blissfully happy and sees mummy as \u2018good\u2019. But if, for whatever reason, the feeding process is difficult, the baby can\u2019t grasp that it is dealing with the same person it liked a lot only a few hours ago. It splits off from the actual mother a second, \u2018bad\u2019 version, whom it deems to be a separate, hateful individual, responsible for deliberately frustrating its wishes, and in the process, protecting the image of the good mother in its mind.\n\nGradually, if things go well, there follows a long and difficult process by which the child integrates these two different people and comes, sadly but realistically, to grasp that there is no ideal, \u2018perfect\u2019 mummy \u2013 just one person who is usually lovely but can also be cross, busy, tired, who can make mistakes, and be very interested in other people.\n\nIt may have been a long time since we were being fed as babies, but the tendency to \u2018split\u2019 those close to us is always there, for we never fully outgrow our childhood selves. In adult life, we may fall deeply in love and split off an ideal version of someone, in whom we see no imperfections and whom we adore without limit. Yet we may suddenly and violently turn against the partner (or a celebrity or a politician) whose good qualities once impressed us, the moment we discover the slightest thing that disturbs or frustrates us in them. We may conclude that they cannot really be good since they have made us suffer.\n\nWe may find it extremely hard to accept that the same person might be very nice and good in some ways and strikingly disappointing in others. The bad version can appear to destroy the good one, although these are really just different and connected aspects of one complex person.\n\nTo cope with the conflict between hope and reality, our culture should teach us good integration skills, prompting us to accept what is imperfect in ourselves and others. We should be gently reminded that no one we can love will ever satisfy us completely, but that it is never worth hating them on that score alone. We should move from the naivety and rage of Splitting to the mature wisdom of Integration.\n\nSee also: Being \u2018Good\u2019; Cheerful Despair; Crushes; Good Enough; Kintsugi; Melancholy; Sentimentality; Weakness of Strength; Wisdom.",

Typically the argument is that it should provide worthy but unpopular programming that the free market wouldn\u2019t support.\n\nBut there\u2019s another, more impressive, purpose they could have: to improve the psychology of the nation. A large, arguably even the largest, share of the issues undermining advanced nations are \u2018psychological\u2019 at their root; that is, they have to do with our minds, with our deeper patterns of thinking and feeling. These problems include family breakdown, domestic violence, poor parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, obesity, depression, chronic anxiety, delinquency and loneliness. Taken together, these issues directly \u2013 and indirectly \u2013 cost national governments a massive share of their annual national budgets. Currently, there is no easy way for governments to address any of these problems.\n\nThis is where the tantalising opportunity lies. Just within reach of most governments, available for no extra money, stands the most powerful lever imaginable: the state broadcaster. Broadcasting is the single most effective way of changing mentalities, dramatically more helpful than a book, leaflet or class. Revolutionaries have always known this; it\u2019s why they have always driven their tanks to the TV station first.\n\nIn order to stand any chance of addressing national psychological ills, it is key to get into people\u2019s minds on a huge scale, with charm and skill, at regular, repeated intervals. The challenge wouldn\u2019t be (as now) to make the odd unpopular programme about important things, but to turn out consistently compelling work that points to the resolution of the most damaging patterns of behaviour.\n\nWith enough creativity applied, public broadcasting could do more to cure the troubles of nations than the police force, social services and the drugs squad combined. A huge opportunity is at hand, waiting for the necessary political will, intellectual focus and creative talent to develop.\n\nSee also: Changing the World; Good Nationalism; Seduction; Utopia.",

In most of life, a sense of our smallness is experienced as a humiliation \u2013 when it happens, for example, at the hands of a professional enemy or a concierge. But the impression of smallness that unfolds in the presence of the Sublime has an oddly uplifting and profoundly redemptive effect. We are granted an impression of our complete nullity and insignificance in a grander scheme, which relieves us from an often oppressive sense of the seriousness of all our ambitions and desires and of all our rivals and heroes. We welcome being put back in our place and not having to take ourselves quite so seriously \u2013 not least because the agent doing so is as noble and awe-inspiring as a ten-thousand-year-old ice sheet or a volcano on the surface of Mars.\n\nThings that have up until now been looming in our minds (what\u2019s gone wrong with the Seville office, a colleague\u2019s cold behaviour, the disagreement about patio furniture) is usefully cut down in size. Local, immediate sorrows are reduced; none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes has very much significance for a time. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. We are granted a perspective within which our own concerns are mercifully irrelevant.\n\nBits of our egoism and pride seem less impressive. We may be moved to be more tolerant, less wrapped up in our own concerns. We\u2019re reminded of our fragility and transient occupation of the world, which can move us to focus on what\u2019s genuinely important, while there is still time. The Sublime foregrounds a sense of equality, which we can otherwise find it hard to hold onto. In the face of vast things, the grades of human status lose meaning. The CEO and the intern are equally transient arrangements of atoms.\n\nOur reversals matter less as well. We become more alive to the impersonal, implacable forces that erode all aspects of nature and, hence, all our lives. Like the cliffs under the pressure of the raging oceans, our plans will collapse and fail. Our griefs are universal and unavoidable. The intense burden of the unfairness of existence is reduced.\n\nCrucially, the Sublime isn\u2019t just an idea; it\u2019s a piece of applied philosophy experienced via the senses. The mere idea of our own littleness won\u2019t impact upon us just as an abstract proposition. We have to feel it; we have to stand at the edge of the ocean with the wind raging about us or see the Singapore Straits from thirty thousand feet at dawn. The importance of a sensory impression reveals a general truth about how our minds work: pure ideas are feeble tools for affecting human conduct; we can too easily shrug off words. This is why art and travel are ideal resources of culture. At their best, they integrate thought and feeling: the good idea they are seeking to teach us is delivered in the way we need \u2013 wrapped up in powerful sensory emotions.\n\nWe need not just the idea of cliffs; for philosophy to work its proper effect, we need regularly to take the whole of ourselves out to them.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Animals; Nature.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Success at School vs. Success in Life\n\nGiven how long we spend in schools of various kinds, and the intense efforts we often make to obtain good grades in them, it is bewildering and deeply counter-intuitive how often success at school does not automatically translate into success in life: the star student may move into a good-sounding job, but then not flourish; the person who couldn\u2019t pass their exams may end up running the business (or, as importantly, may form a long-term, contented relationship).\n\nIf we examine the current dominant idea of education, the disconnect is not surprising. Success at school hinges on attitudes and mental habits that have little to offer when we face the challenges on which success in life depends.\n\nThe root of the problem is that school curricula are not reverse-engineered from fulfilled adult lives in the here and now. They don\u2019t start by asking what skills and knowledge actually serve us in adulthood and devote themselves to nurturing star pupils in those areas. Instead, schools are typically fixated on several unhelpful ideas: that primarily you have to learn what is known already, rather than develop the capacity to solve problems to which no handy solution yet exists; that it is the intellect that needs to be trained, whereas it is the quality of our emotional intelligence that will make the biggest difference in our professional and personal relationships; that the teacher knows and you don\u2019t, whereas in the rest of life, people in positions of authority may well be deeply mistaken in their views; that longer is better, though brevity, wit and memorable one-liners carry more weight everywhere else.\n\nSchools teach us to redeploy rather than originate ideas; to seek permission; to meet rather than change expectations; to imagine that those in charge know what they are doing rather than guessing one can do better. Schools teach us anything other than the two skills that really determine the quality of adult life: knowing how to choose the right job, and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships.\n\nThat said, it isn\u2019t the case that all we need to do to succeed at life is to flunk school. A good life requires us to do two very tricky things: be an extremely good boy or girl for twenty years, and simultaneously never really to believe in the long-term validity or seriousness of what we\u2019re being asked to study. We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and committedly rebellious.\n\nSee also: Emotional Intelligence; School of Life, The; Wisdom.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Suicide\n\nOne of the most surprising aspects about one of the saddest of all human possibilities is that the suicide rate goes up markedly the richer and more developed a society becomes. We might expect suicide rates to vary across time and place, but not to increase alongside developments in wealth, comfort and security. That we should be unwittingly creating nations in which more of us end up killing ourselves appears to negate the whole purpose of economic growth.\n\nNevertheless, the disturbing connection was first identified towards the end of the 19th century by the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, and has continued to be noted ever since. The suicide rate of a less developed country like the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a fraction of the rate of a developed nation like South Korea. The crucial factor behind people\u2019s decision to end their lives is not really wealth or poverty. As Durkheim discovered, it is the extent to which the surrounding culture ascribes responsibility for failure to individuals or else maintains a faith that poor luck or divine intervention are to blame instead.\n\nIt so happens that as societies become modern and industrialised, they very frequently give up their beliefs in demons and gods and start instead to trust in a meritocratic, individualistic philosophy that suggests to people that their fate is always in their own hands. This may sound generous, but it carries an immense psychological burden: when failures occur, the individual is held entirely responsible for them. Reversals start to seem like a horrendous judgement on one\u2019s worth and a public humiliation from which there may, at the extreme, seem no escape other than self-annihilation.\n\nBut suicide is merely the most extreme symptom of a more general sense of personal responsibility. It isn\u2019t the wealth of a nation we should blame; it is its ideology.\n\nThere are two big cultural ideas that may help to mitigate the pressures upon us: luck and tragedy. To believe in luck is accurately to observe that merit and success are never reliably aligned: one may be a fool and win, or a virtuous person and fail. If we fully internalise and widely share the notion of luck, then the shame of failure will be greatly reduced, and our agony along with it. We will be able to admit, publicly and to ourselves, that decent people can fail in their outward circumstances and that professional success isn\u2019t the only, or even the crucial, marker of the merit of human beings.\n\nTragedy, as it originated in Ancient Greece, is the story of a capable and intelligent person who happens to make a small mistake, which leads to appalling consequences. The point of presenting such stories in very public ways (the entire community had to attend Greek festivals) was to continually renew acquaintance with a hugely important idea: that one can be a likeable, even admirable, person and end up in an utterly desperate situation. Tragedy is the careful telling of how disaster can come into the lives of people like (or even a bit nicer than) us. They \u2013 and hence we \u2013 are always deserving of compassion rather than contempt.\n\nDurkheim knew that it is not prosperity by itself that increases the suicide rate. The toxic element is an unwittingly cruel culture that assigns a high burden of responsibility to us, while seeming to deny the truth that chance and tragedy will always affect our destinies.\n\nThe real solution to a high suicide rate lies in an unexpected place: an ideology that firmly reminds us that we are never the sole authors of our destinies.\n\nSee also: Artistic Sympathy; Equality and Envy; Luck; Meritocracy; Tragedy.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Sulking\n\nSulking combines a powerful symbolic articulation of anger with an intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about. One both desperately needs to be understood and yet is profoundly committed to not making it easy for another person to understand one.\n\nThe stance is no coincidence. One remains silent and furiously gnomic because having to spell out the offence another has caused feels contrary to the spirit of love, interpreted in a Romantic sense: if the other requires an explanation, it is proof they are not worthy of being granted one. After all, true love should be about mutual speedy intuition, not laborious articulation.\n\nIn a sense, it is an odd privilege to be the recipient of a sulk, for one tends to fall into a sulk only with people whom one feels should understand one, in whom one has placed a high degree of trust, and yet who appear to have broken the contract of the relationship. We would never dare to storm out of a room, call someone a shit and stay silent the rest of the evening in an upstairs room unless one was with a partner whom one believed had a profound capacity to understand one, which they had \u2013 strangely, probably out of spite \u2013 chosen not to use on this occasion. It is one of the stranger gifts of love.\n\nSulking pays homage to a beautiful, yet in practice catastrophic, Romantic ideal of love: that of being understood without needing to speak. At a deep level, the structure of the sulk reveals a debt to earliest childhood. In the womb, we never had to explain what we needed. Food and comfort simply came. If we had the privilege of being relatively well parented, some of that idyll may have continued in our first years. We didn\u2019t have to make our every need known; someone guessed for us. They saw through our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions, and found the explanations when we didn\u2019t have the ability to verbalise them. The sulker continues to want to be interpreted the way they once were.\n\nThe cure is a dose of pessimism. We should be reminded of the unfairness of wanting every aspect of our souls to be grasped without us needing to say a word. It is not necessarily an insult to be misunderstood and called upon to communicate. When our lovers fail to fathom us and unwittingly barge into our more tender sides, it isn\u2019t an immediate sign that they are heartless. It may merely be that we have grown a little too committed to not teaching them about who we are.\n\nSee also: Teaching and Learning.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Teaching and Learning\n\nTeaching and learning are the two central emotional skills we need for life among other humans. Considered properly, teaching \u2013 by which we mean the business of getting an important idea from one mind into another \u2013 is vital in any couple, office or family we\u2019ll ever belong to. Every one of us, whatever our occupation, needs to become a good teacher, for our lives constantly require us to deliver crucial information with grace and effectiveness into the deep minds of others. Furthermore, we also need the humility required by the student role: we need to recall how little we know; we need to acknowledge how generally unpleasant it is to have to take anything new on board; and we need to admit how tempting it is to blame the teacher rather than confront their message.\n\nMost of us probably started off by being quite bad teachers, with tendencies to get annoyed by the fact that another person doesn\u2019t know something yet \u2013 even though we have never told them what it might be. Certain ideas can seem so important to us, we can\u2019t imagine that others don\u2019t already know them. We suspect they may be deliberately upsetting us by pretending not to have a clue. This attitude makes it unlikely that what we actually have to teach will make its way successfully into the other person\u2019s head. Good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance is not a defect of the individual we\u2019re instructing; it\u2019s the consequence of never having been properly taught. The fault only ever belongs with the people who haven\u2019t done enough to get the needed ideas into others\u2019 heads \u2013 in other words, with you.\n\nThe more we need other people to know something, the less we may be able to secure the calm frame of mind that is indispensable if we are to have a chance of conveying it to them effectively. The possibility that they won\u2019t quickly understand a point that matters immensely to us can drive us into an agitated fury \u2013 the very worst state in which to conduct any lesson. By the time we\u2019ve started to insult our so-called pupil, to shout, call them a blockhead or a fool, the lesson is plainly over. No one has ever learnt anything under conditions of humiliation. Paradoxically, the best sort of teachers can bear the possibility that what they have to teach will not be understood. It is this slightly detached, slightly pessimistic approach that stands the best chance of generating the relaxed frame of mind essential to successful pedagogy.\n\nGood teachers are also good students. They know that everyone has a lot to learn and everyone has something important to impart to others. We should never become incensed if someone is trying to teach us something. We should never want to be liked just as we are. Only a perfect being would be committed to their own status quo. For the rest of us, good learning and teaching are the only ways to ensure we have a chance of developing into slightly better versions of ourselves.\n\nSee also: Love as Education; Love Me as I Am; Nagging; Procrastination; Seduction; Sulking; Teasing.",

There is nasty teasing, of course, in which we pick away at a sore spot in someone\u2019s life. But there is a genuinely valuable affectionate version, generous and loving, which feels good to be on the receiving end of.\n\nAll of us become a bit unbalanced in one way or another: too serious, too gloomy, too jokey. We all benefit from being tugged back towards a healthier mean by a well-aimed, tenderly delivered tease. The good teaser latches onto and responds to our distinctive quirks and is compassionately constructive about trying to reconnect us with our better selves \u2013 not by delivering a stern lesson, but by helping us to notice our excesses and laugh at them. We sense the teaser trying, with love, to give us a useful shove in a good (and secretly welcome) direction.\n\nThe best teasing remarks emerge from genuine insights into who we are. A person has studied us, put their finger on a struggle that\u2019s going on in us and has taken the part of the highest \u2013 but currently under-supported \u2013 side of us. This feels so good because, only too often, others simply don\u2019t see past the forbidding or off-putting front we assume for the world; they have no imagination to detect the kinder self beneath the tricky surface. They simply think we are gloomy, stern, angry or obsessed. The teaser does us the favour of recognising that the dominant front doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nTeasing is a subtle, powerful mode of teaching. It builds on a hugely important insight about human beings: criticism of any kind is exceptionally hard to absorb; we are slow and reluctant learners, with well-observed tendencies to ignore and turn against those who try to lecture us. By amusingly exaggerating our exaggerations, teasing combines criticism with charm. The negative point is real, but it is carefully wrapped in kindness and disguised as entertainment \u2013 and is therefore much easier to take on board. It seduces us into virtue. (\u2018If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they\u2019ll kill you\u2019, knew George Bernard Shaw.)\n\nPerhaps the most instructive question we can ask \u2013 the one that teaches us most about the value of affectionate teasing and of the path we still need to take towards emotional maturity \u2013 is simply: what do I need to be teased about?\n\nSee also: Teaching and Learning; Universal Love.",

We fear not just poverty; we\u2019re terrified of mockery and ridicule.\n\nBut there is one art form in particular that, since its inception, has dedicated itself to recounting stories of great failure without recourse to mockery or judgement. While not absolving people of responsibility for their actions, its achievement has been to offer to those involved in catastrophes \u2013 disgraced statesmen, murderers, the bankrupt, emotional compulsives \u2013 a level of sympathy owed, but rarely paid, to every human.\n\nTragic art began in the theatres of Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE. It followed a hero, usually a high-born one, a king or a famous warrior, from prosperity and acclaim to ruin and shame, through some error of his own. The way the story was told was likely to leave audience members at once hesitant to condemn the hero for what had befallen him and humbled by recognising how easily they too might be ruined if they were ever in a situation similar to the hero\u2019s. The tragedy would leave them sorrowful before the difficulties of leading a good life and modest before those who had failed at the undertaking.\n\nIf a newspaper, with its language of perverts and weirdoes, failures and losers, lies at one end of the spectrum of understanding, then it is tragedy that lies at the other \u2013 attempting to build bridges between the guilty and the apparently blameless, challenging our ordinary conceptions of responsibility, standing as the most psychologically sophisticated, most respectful account of how a human being may be dishonoured, without at the same time forfeiting the right to be heard.\n\nThe tragedian draws us close to an almost unbearable truth: that every folly or blindness of which a human being has been guilty can be traced back to aspects of our own nature; that we bear within ourselves the whole of the human condition, in its worst and best aspects, so that we too might be capable of anything under the right (or very wrong) circumstances. Once an audience has been brought close to this fact, they may willingly dismount from their high horses and feel their powers of sympathy and humility enhanced; they may accept how easily their own lives could be shattered if certain of their more regrettable character traits, which had until then led to no serious accident, were one day to come into contact with a situation that allowed these flaws unlimited and catastrophic reign.\n\nThat the legendary failed characters of art seem noble to us has little to do with their qualities per se and almost everything to do with the way we have been taught to consider them by their creators and chroniclers.\n\nSee also: Art for Art\u2019s Sake; Artistic Sympathy; Consolation; Day of Judgement; Inner Voices; Luck; Original Sin; Suicide; Universal Love.",

We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to what feels like a very familiar threat.\n\nIn most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy, and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is distantly evocative of our earlier troubles.\n\nThe unconscious mind is slow to realise that things have changed in the outer world and is quick to mistake one person for another, twenty years ago for now, seeming to judge only by the crudest of correspondences.\n\nTransference generally happens without us knowing it. We think we are responding to the present while in fact being guided by a pattern from the past. We carry years behind us that we have forgotten about and that we aren\u2019t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We can easily just come across as mean or mad.\n\nThe concept of transference provides a vantage point on some of the most frustrating behaviours that any of us ever generate. It allows us to feel sympathy for other people where we might have felt only irritation. A wiser culture would teach us that transference is normal. Recognising that one is doing it oneself is not an admission of unusual idiocy; it\u2019s an instance of mature self-knowledge.\n\nSee also: Emotional Education; Emotional Scepticism; Faulty Walnut, The.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Transitional Object\n\nBetween the ages of around one and twelve, many children manifest a deep attachment to a stuffed soft object, normally shaped into a bear, a rabbit or \u2013 less often \u2013 a penguin. The depth of the relationship can be extraordinary. The child sleeps with it, talks to it, cries in front of it and tells it things they would never tell anyone else. What\u2019s truly remarkable is that the animal looks after its owner, addressing them in a tone of unusual maturity and kindness. It might, in a crisis, urge the child not to worry and to look forward to better times in the future. Naturally, the animal\u2019s character is entirely made up. The animal is simply something invented, or brought to life, by one part of the child in order to look after the other.\n\nThe English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott was the first person to write seriously and with sensitivity about the business of stuffed animals. He called them \u2018transitional objects\u2019. In a paper from the early 1960s, Winnicott described a boy of six, whose parents had been abusive to him, becoming very connected to a small animal his grandmother had given him. Every night, he would have a dialogue with the animal, would hug him close to his chest and shed a few tears into his stained and greying soft fur. It was his most precious possession, for which he would have given up everything else. As the boy summarised the situation to Winnicott: \u2018No one else can understand me like bunny can.\u2019\n\nWhat fascinated Winnicott here was that it was the boy who had invented the rabbit, given him his identity, his voice and his way of addressing him. The boy was speaking to himself \u2013 via the bunny \u2013 in a voice filled with an otherwise all too rare compassion and sympathy.\n\nAlthough it sounds a little odd, speaking to ourselves is common practice throughout our lives. Often, when we do so, the tone is harsh and punitive. We upbraid ourselves for being losers, time-wasters or perverts. But, as Winnicott knew, mental well-being depends on having to hand a repertoire of more gentle, forgiving and hopeful inner voices. To keep going, there are moments when one side of the mind needs to say to the other that the criticism is enough, that it understands, that this could happen to anyone, that one could not have known. It is this kind of indispensable benevolent voice that the child first starts to rehearse and exercise with the help of a stuffed animal.\n\nIn adolescence, animals tend to get put away. They become embarrassing, evoking a vulnerability we\u2019re keen to escape from. But, to follow Winnicott, if our development has gone well, what was trialled in the presence of a stuffed animal should continue all of our lives, because, by definition, we will frequently be let down by the people around us, who won\u2019t be able to understand us, listen to our griefs and be kind to us in the manner we crave and require. Every healthy adult should therefore possess a capacity for self-nurture; that is, for retreating to a safe, secluded space and speaking in a tone that is gentle, encouraging and infinitely forgiving. That we don\u2019t formally label the understanding self \u2018white rabbit\u2019 or \u2018yellow bear\u2019 shouldn\u2019t obscure the debt that the nurturing adult self owes to its earlier embodiment in a furry toy.\n\nA good adult life requires us to see the links between our strengths and our regressive states. Being properly mature demands a gracious accommodation with what can seem childlike, embarrassing or humiliatingly vulnerable. We should honour stuffed animals for what they really are: tools to help us on our first steps in the vital business of knowing how to look after ourselves.\n\nSee also: Inner Voices.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Ugliness\n\nMost of us are, to some extent, ugly. We should accept with Stoic good grace that personal appearance is simply one of the least democratic parts of life.\n\nWe tend to misunderstand how common ugliness is, in part because the images in the media always highlight the pretty ones. In truth, beauty is as rare as mass murder. The problem is that we tend to think there are far more murders than there are. Thanks to the media, it can feel as if everyone is knifing everyone else. We recognise symptoms of panic when the frequency of a bad thing is exaggerated. We don\u2019t yet recognise a similar hysteria when the frequency of a good thing gets exaggerated.\n\nFortunately, not everyone minds ugliness. The reason is simple. People learn about love from their parents; our elders provide the template for affection that comes into force when children grow up. Fortunately for the ugly, many parents who are kind and loving are also peculiar in looks. Many people, even very attractive ones, therefore grow up predisposed to think generously of not-so-perfect people. They are the physical types with whom they continue to associate comfort, safety and tenderness.\n\nUgliness is fascinatingly impervious to class and status. Given all the iniquities of the social system, it is some form of compensation that there should also be \u2013 alongside the near-feudal ranks of money and power \u2013 another hierarchy based on looks, in which a different elite is established and where the shop assistant may triumph over the CEO.\n\nHowever random the distribution of appearance is today, time will \u2013 eventually \u2013 bring justice. No one ends up happy with how they look. For some, disenchantment may start at ten. For others it may require another forty years. It always happens.\n\nThe trouble with our culture is not so much that we love appearances, but that we allow too narrow a range of features to dominate our understanding of beauty. There is ultimately something attractive in everyone: perhaps an august bearing to the forehead, a melancholy sweetness in the eyes, a candour in the nose. We should broaden our criteria of where we find beauty. And hopefully someone, somewhere, will one day do the same for us.\n\nSee also: Appreciation; Normality; Resilience.",

At one point \u2013 described in chapter 7 of Luke\u2019s Gospel \u2013 he goes to a dinner party and a local prostitute turns up, much to the disgust of the hosts. But Jesus is friendly and sweet and defends her against everyone else\u2019s criticism. In a way that shocks the other guests, he insists that she is a good person at heart.\n\nThere\u2019s another story (in Matthew, chapter 8) where Jesus is approached by a man with leprosy. He\u2019s in a disgusting state. But Jesus isn\u2019t shocked; he reaches out his hand and touches the man. Despite the horrendous appearance, here is someone (in Jesus\u2019s eyes) entirely deserving of closeness and kindness. In a similar vein, at other times, Jesus conspicuously argues that tax collectors, thieves and adulterers are never to be thought of as outside the circle of love.\n\nMany centuries after Jesus\u2019s death, the foremost medieval thinker Thomas Aquinas defined what Jesus was getting at in this way of talking about love: the person who truly understands love could love anyone, wrote Aquinas. In other words: true love isn\u2019t specific in its target; it doesn\u2019t fixate on particular qualities; it is open to all of humanity, even (and in a way especially) its less appealing examples.\n\nThis can sound like a deeply strange notion of what love is, for our background ideas about love tend to be closely tied to a dramatic experience: that of falling in love, finding one, very specific person immensely attractive, exciting and free of any failings or drawbacks. Love is, we feel, a response to the overt perfection of another person.\n\nYet \u2013 via some admittedly extreme examples \u2013 a very important aspect of love is being pushed to the fore in Jesus\u2019s vision. And we don\u2019t have to be Christian \u2013 that is, we don\u2019t have to believe that there\u2019s an afterlife or that Jesus was born to a virgin \u2013 to benefit from it.\n\nAt the heart of this kind of love is an effort to see beyond the outwardly unappealing surface of another human in search of the tender, interesting, scared and vulnerable person inside.\n\nWhat we know as the \u2018work\u2019 of love is the emotional, imaginative labour required to peer behind an off-putting fa\u00e7ade. Our minds tend to resist such a move. They follow well-worn grooves that feel at once familiar and justified. If someone has hurt us, we almost inevitably see them as mean, rather than, as might be the case, anxious or sad.\n\nIt takes quite a deliberate, taxing effort of the mind to move ourselves off our deeply established responses and to learn to see that everyone is, ultimately, fragile, hurt, damaged and deserving of love.\n\nSee also: Artistic Sympathy; Bad Taste; Charity of Interpretation; Inner Idiot, The; Love as Generosity; Other-as-Child; Shyness; Teasing; Tragedy; Weakness of Strength.",

There are feelings that exist in an \u2018unprocessed\u2019 form within us. A great many worries may remain disavowed and uninterpreted and manifest themselves as powerful, directionless anxiety. Under their sway, we may feel a compulsive need to remain busy, fear spending any time on our own, or cling to activities that ensure we don\u2019t meet what scares us head on (these might include internet pornography, tracking the news or exercising compulsively).\n\nA similar kind of disavowal can go on around hurt. Someone may have abused our trust, made us doubt their kindness or violated our self-esteem, but we are driven to flee a frank recognition of an appalling degree of exposure and vulnerability. The hurt is somewhere inside, but on the surface, we adopt a brittle good cheer (jolliness being sadness that doesn\u2019t know itself), we numb ourselves chemically, or else adopt a carefully non-specific tone of cynicism that masks the specific wound that has been inflicted on us.\n\nWe pay dearly for our failure to \u2018process\u2019 our feelings. Our minds grow unoriginal from a background apprehension as to their contents. We grow depressed about everything because we cannot be sad about something. We can no longer sleep, insomnia being the revenge of all the many thoughts we have omitted to process in the day.\n\nWe need compassion for ourselves. We avoid processing emotions because what we feel is so contrary to our self-image, so threatening to our society\u2019s ideas of normality and so at odds with who we would like to be. An atmosphere conducive to processing would be one in which the difficulties of being human were warmly recognised and charitably accepted. We fail to know ourselves not out of laziness or casual neglect, but out of fear and shame.\n\nProcessing emotions requires good friends, deft therapists and ritual moments like Philosophical Meditation, in which our normal defences can safely be put aside and unfamiliar material ringfenced for investigation.\n\nThe outcome of processing our emotions is always an alleviation in our overall mood. But first we must pay for our self-awareness with a period of mourning in which we gradually acknowledge that, in some area or other, life is simply a lot sadder than we want it to be.\n\nSee also: Addiction; Insomnia; Jolliness; Philosophical Meditation; Self-Knowledge.",

How could schools be redesigned? How might working environments be reformed? What would the media be like? How would anger be dealt with? How might we rethink old age and death?\n\nWe may be tempted to dismiss emotional utopian thinking as ridiculously disconnected from the real world and therefore a waste of time. But Utopias are better understood as thought experiments in which we try to define important goals without having to bother with many of the practical issues that will one day have to be sorted out. We need our imaginations to go ahead and define a destination in order to know where we will have to direct our slow-moving packhorses and mules.\n\nTo the utopian thinker, the fact that we don\u2019t quite know every detail about how to carry out an important project doesn\u2019t constitute a decisive objection against it. A Utopia is what sets our course and defines our ambitions.\n\nSee also: Advertising; Envy of the Future; Good Business; Good Demand; Monasteries; State Broadcasting.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Vocation Myth\n\nThe Vocation Myth is the belief in the spontaneous revelation of our professional destiny: we\u2019ll simply know in time what we need to do work-wise.\n\nThe difficulty of defining a professional goal currently lacks the generous, extensive and careful consideration it deserves. We tend to see confusion about our career paths as a slightly embarrassing failing that reflects poorly on its sufferers. Confusion is taken as a sign of being a bit muddled and impractical, of being unreasonably picky or hard to please; perhaps we regard it as a consequence of being spoilt (\u2018you should be thankful for any job\u2019) or as a troubling symptom of a lack of commitment or general flightiness. We arrive at these rather harsh assessments because we\u2019re still under the spell of a big and often poisonous idea that can be termed the Vocation Myth.\n\nThis myth originated around certain religious experiences, which, although rare, were regarded as hugely impressive and significant, and were accorded an inordinate degree of publicity in the history of the West. These were moments when an individual was summoned by God \u2013 sometimes speaking through an angel; at other points talking directly through the clouds \u2013 and was directed by God to devote their life to an aspect of the divine cause.\n\nOne significant story concerned the philosopher St. Augustine, who, in mid-life, changed jobs under divine instruction. He went from being a pagan professor of literature to being a Catholic bishop. It was a huge career change, but Augustine didn\u2019t have to work it out on his own. In 386, he happened to be staying in Milan and one day went out for a walk. He heard a child singing a lovely song he\u2019d never heard before. The words of the chorus were \u2018pick it up, pick it up\u2019, and he understood that the words were a command from God. He was to pick up a Bible and read the first passage he set his eyes on. The very one he alighted upon told him to change his life and become the figure we know today as a great Catholic thinker and clergyman.\n\nHowever tied to Catholic theology the story might seem, we have secularised such accounts without quite realising it. We too proceed as if, at some point, we might be expected to hear a quasi-celestial command directing us towards our life\u2019s purpose.\n\nAs often happens, it started with artists. Up until the Renaissance, being an artist was simply a kind of job that some people had, almost always because it was something that their father or uncle was involved in. Being a painter or making statues wasn\u2019t regarded as radically different from making shoes or bridles for horses; it was just a useful skilled trade that any assiduous individual who went through the proper course of training could become good at with time. But then, borrowing from the religious stories, artists began to think of themselves as \u2018called\u2019 by fate to a particular line of work. Something within them was pulling them towards their art. Michelangelo was the most extreme example of this attitude, seeing himself as required by his soul to paint fresco ceilings and chip away at blocks of marble. He might sometimes have wished he could stop, but he could only have done so by betraying his vocation.\n\nThe notion of vocation features in the biographies of many of the world\u2019s most famous people. For example, we learn that the pioneering French scientist Marie Curie knew from the age of fifteen that her life depended on being able to undertake scientific research. She struggled determinedly against every difficulty in her path \u2013 she had no money and when she was a student she nearly froze to death one winter and frequently fainted from hunger. But eventually she triumphed and was awarded two Nobel prizes, the first in 1903 for her work on X-rays and the second in 1911 for the discovery of radium and polonium.\n\nAs a result of such cases, having a vocation has come to seem a sure sign of being destined for great things. Conversely, to lack a vocation has come to seem not only a misfortune, but also the mark of inferiority. We end up not only panicked that we don\u2019t have a path in mind, but dispirited that our ignorance is proof that any path we do end up with will necessarily be an insignificant one.\n\nWhat is worse, \u2018finding one\u2019s vocation\u2019 has come to seem like a discovery of which we should all be capable in a brief span of time. And the way to discover such a vocation should be (thanks to religious and artistic forerunners) entirely passive: one should simply wait for a moment of revelation, for the modern equivalent of a clap of thunder or a divine voice, an inner urge or an instinct pushing us towards podiatry or supply chain management.\n\nA small but significant echo of this attitude can be traced in our habit of asking even very young children what they want to be when they are grown up. There\u2019s a faint but revealing assumption that somewhere among the options being entertained by the child (footballer, zookeeper, space explorer, etc.), there will already be the first stumbling articulations of the crucial inner voice announcing the small person\u2019s true destiny. It appears not to strike us as especially peculiar to expect a five-and-a-half-year-old to understand their identity in the adult labour market.\n\nAll this helps to explain the relative societal silence around the task of working out what to do with our lives. Well-meaning friends and family will often simply advise a confused person to wait, until one day something will strike them as just right.\n\nOf course, contrary to what this unfortunate, oppressive notion of vocation suggests, it is entirely reasonable \u2013 even healthy \u2013 not to know what one\u2019s talents are or how to apply them. One\u2019s nature is ultimately so complex, one\u2019s abilities so tricky to define in detail, the needs of the world so elusive, that discovering the best fit between oneself and a job is a momentous, highly legitimate challenge that requires an immense amount of thought, exploration and wise assistance that might take up years of our attention. It\u2019s wholly reasonable not to know what work one should perform. Indeed, it is often a great sign of maturity to realise that one doesn\u2019t know rather than suffer any longer under the punishing assumption of innate vocation.\n\nSee also: Duty Trap, The; Job Fixation; Meaningful Work.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Vulnerability\n\nThere are aspects to all of us that, if they were exposed to a harsh or unsympathetic critic, would result in severe humiliation and mockery.\n\nFrom close up, none of us are reliably impressive. We get agitated, fretful, cantankerous and panicky. Under the pressure of events, we shout, slam doors and let out screams or wails. We have episodes of absurd clumsiness; we bump into doors, trip, and drop things down our front. We\u2019re worried pretty much all the time: about how others see us; about where our careers are going; about everything important that we have forgotten to do in our lives. We long for love, but are unthinking and insensitive around those close to us. We are gauche in our efforts to seduce and pitiful in our requests for attention. Our bodies have a range of shameful habits and vulnerabilities. We are, from certain angles, truly embarrassing propositions.\n\nAll this we struggle to hide. The Inner Idiot is carefully monitored and ruthlessly gagged. We have learnt from our earliest years that the only priority around vulnerability is to disguise it completely. We strive remorselessly to look composed, to erase the evidence of our silliness and to try to appear a great deal more \u2018normal\u2019 than we know we are.\n\nWe are understandably very focused on the downsides of vulnerability. What is far less well recognised is vulnerability\u2019s occasional significant and profound upsides.\n\nThere are moments when the revelation of weakness, far from being a catastrophe, is the only possible route to connection and respect. At points we may dare to explain, with rare frankness, that we are afraid, that we are sometimes bad and that we have done many silly things. Rather than appalling our companions, these revelations may serve to endear us to them, humanising us in their eyes, and letting them feel that their own vulnerabilities have echoes in the lives of others. Together, we realise that the definition of what is normal has missed out on key aspects of our mutual reality.\n\nIn other words, vulnerability can be the bedrock of friendship \u2013 friendship properly understood, not primarily as a process of admiration, but as an exchange of sympathy and consolation for the troublesome business of being alive.\n\nThere can, of course, be unfortunate ways of handling vulnerability: when we do so in the form of an aggressive demand that others rescue us, or when our frailties lack boundaries, or when we are close to rage and hysteria rather than melancholy and grief.\n\nGood vulnerability doesn\u2019t expect another person to solve our difficulties; we let them see a tricky part of who we are, simply in the hope that they will be emboldened to feel more at ease with their own, less dignified sides. Good vulnerability is fundamentally generous: it takes the first step at disclosure so as to render it safe for others to unburden themselves and disclose something of their hidden selves in turn. It is a gift in the form of a risk taken for someone else.\n\nFurthermore, displays of vulnerability have a curious way of signalling that we are, despite the embarrassing avowals, far from fundamentally ridiculous or pitiful. We are, rather, strong enough to be weak; to let our silliness, idiocy, anger and sadness show, confident that these do not have to be the final verdicts on who we are. We proceed with a bold sense that, despite the lack of surface evidence, everyone else is as wounded, aggrieved, worried and damaged as we are and that we are not therefore, through our disclosures, casting ourselves out of the clan for good: we are simply reconfirming our essential membership of the human race.\n\nIt is a minor tragedy that we should spend so much of our lives striving to hide our weakness when it is only upon the dignified sharing of vulnerability that true friendship and love can arise.\n\nSee also: Clumsiness; Inner Idiot, The; Jolliness; Melancholy; Normality; Politeness; Psychological Asymmetry; Sane Insanity; Warmth.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Warmth\n\nAlthough politeness is always preferable to rudeness, there are ways of being polite that badly miss the mark and can leave us, as its recipients, feeling oddly detached and dissatisfied. Picture the person who ends up, despite their best efforts, seeming what we can call \u2018coldly\u2019 polite. They may be extremely keen to please those they are seeing, they obey all the rules of etiquette, yet never manage to make their hospitality feel engaging or memorable. It may be a long time before another meeting with them is suggested.\n\nBy contrast, there is the person who exhibits the virtue of \u2018warmth\u2019; someone who follows the cold person in the basic principles of politeness, but manages to add a critical emotionally comforting ingredient to their manner. When we have an evening planned with them, they might suggest making toasted cheese sandwiches at their place rather than going out to a restaurant; they might chat to us through the bathroom door, put on the songs they loved dancing to when they were fourteen, plump up a cushion and slot it behind our back, confess to feeling intimidated by a mutual acquaintance, bring us a posy of daisies or a card they made and, when we\u2019re down with the flu, call us up and ask how our ears are feeling.\n\nThe difference between the warm and the cold person lies in a contrasting vision of human nature. Broadly, the cold person is operating with an implicit view that those they are attempting to please are creatures endowed only with the highest needs. As a result, all kinds of assumptions are made about them: that they are interested exclusively in so-called serious topics (especially art and politics); that they will appreciate a degree of formality in dining and sitting; that they will be strong, self-contained and mature enough not to have any hunger for reassurance or cosiness, and that they will be without urgent physical vulnerabilities and drives that might prove offensive if they were mentioned.\n\nConversely, the warm person is always aware that the stranger is (irrespective of their status or outward dignity) a highly needy, fragile, confused, appetitive and susceptible creature. They know this about the stranger because they never forget this about themselves.\n\nThey know that however solid and dignified someone appears on the outside, behind the scenes there will inevitably be a struggling self, potentially awkward, easily bemused, beset by physical appetites, on the verge of loneliness, and frequently in need of nothing more subtle or elevated than a cheese sandwich, a glass of milk and a hug.\n\nIn a warm social manner we\u2019re catching sight of a major theme: the lower and \u2018bad\u2019 parts of a person are accepted and integrated into a more accurate picture of who they are. Warmth is a central way in which we get closer to other people through a due understanding of our collective human nature and thereby reduce the burdens of loneliness.\n\nSee also: Getting an Early Night; Listening as Editing; Loneliness; Normality; Shyness; Vulnerability.",

But, in general, our current culture has had quite a restricted agenda. It has been very good at getting us to see the charms of dolphins, mountains, little villages in rural France, beaches with palm trees, brilliantly engineered bridges and Art Deco hotels from the 1920s. These are all worthy objects of delight, but they are rare, which is a problem: the things we encounter every day can feel dreary and disappointing by comparison.\n\nBernd and Hilla Becher, Water Towers, 1972\u20132009.\n\nThe Bechers\u2019 sympathetic eye transformed water towers from unloved industrial eyesores to objects worthy of admiration; art can do this for many under-appreciated subjects in the world.\n\nIn 1972, a German couple, Bernd and Hilla Becher, set out to change these assumptions. They started to photograph water towers across Germany and the US. These industrial structures were then among the least admired of all buildings; they were deemed hulking and brutish and people would become predictably furious if ever one was planned near where they lived\n\nYet the Bechers\u2019 photographs \u2013 arranged in serene and elegant frames, and hung in sequences along gallery walls \u2013 showed for the first time just how beautiful these towers actually were. One could appreciate the patterns of rust and their rugged authenticity; their legs had a certain dignity and playfulness.\n\nThe real point of the Bechers\u2019 exercise, however, wasn\u2019t specifically about water storage facilities. The towers provided an example for a much wider point: that there is a great deal more that is lovely and interesting in the world than we expect. To gain access to this, we may need some prompts and guidance. In other words, we may need art.\n\nSee also: Appreciation; Art, The Purpose of; Rock Appreciation; Small Pleasures.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Weakness of Strength\n\nThe failings of friends, colleagues and partners can be deeply galling. We look upon their faults and wonder why they are the way they are.\n\nAt moments of particularly acute agitation, we need to rehearse the Weakness of Strength Theory. This dictates that we should strive to see people\u2019s weaknesses as the inevitable downside of certain merits that drew us to them, and from which we will benefit at other points \u2013 even if none of these benefits are apparent at present. What we\u2019re seeing are not their faults, pure and simple, but rather the shadow side of things that are genuinely good about them. We\u2019re picking up on weaknesses that derive from strengths.\n\nIn the 1870s, when he was living in Paris, the American novelist Henry James became a good friend of the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who was also living in the city at that time. Henry James was particularly taken by the unhurried, tranquil style of the Russian writer\u2019s storytelling. He obviously took a long time over every sentence, weighing different options, changing and polishing until everything was perfect. It was an ambitious, inspiring approach to writing.\n\nHowever, in personal and social life, these same virtues could make Turgenev a maddening companion. He would accept an invitation to lunch, then, the day before, send a note explaining that he would not be able to attend, then another saying how much he looked forward to the occasion. Then he would turn up \u2013 two hours late. Arranging anything with him was a nightmare. Yet his social waywardness was really just the same thing that made him so attractive as a writer. It was the same unwillingness to hurry; the same desire to keep the options open until the last moment. This produced marvellous books, but dinner party chaos. In reflecting on Turgenev\u2019s character, Henry James reflected that his Russian friend was exhibiting the \u2018weakness of his strength\u2019.\n\nThe theory goes like this: every strength that an individual has necessarily brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Every virtue has an associated weakness. Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person.\n\nThis is a theory that can help calm us down at moments of particular crisis, because it changes the way we see the defects, failings and weakness of others. Our minds tend to hive off the strengths and see these as essential, while deeming the weaknesses as a freakish add-on; in truth, the weaknesses are part and parcel of the strengths.\n\nThe theory usefully undermines the unhelpful idea that \u2013 if only we looked a bit harder \u2013 we would find someone who was always perfect to be around. If strengths are invariably connected to failings, there won\u2019t be anyone who is remotely flawless. We may well find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses.\n\nSee also: Charity of Interpretation; Love as Generosity; Splitting and Integration; Universal Love.",

      "tags": "wisdom, realism, gratitude, forgiveness, calm",
      "content": "### \u00b6 Wisdom\n\nTo teach us how to be wise is the underlying central purpose of philosophy. The word may sound abstract and lofty, but wisdom is something we might plausibly aim to acquire a little more of over the course of our lives, even if true wisdom requires that we always keep in mind the persistent risk of madness and error.\n\nWisdom can be said to comprise twelve ingredients:\n\nRealism\n\nThe wise are, first and foremost, \u2018realistic\u2019 about how challenging many things can be. They are fully conscious of the complexities entailed in any project: raising a child, starting a business, spending an agreeable weekend with the family, changing the nation, falling in love \u2026 Knowing that something difficult is being attempted doesn\u2019t rob the wise of ambition, but it makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic about the problems that will invariably come their way. The wise rarely expect anything to be wholly easy or to go entirely well.\n\nGratitude\n\nProperly aware that much can and will go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty, even extremely modest ones, of the kind that those with grander plans rush past. With the dangers and tragedies of existence firmly in mind, they can take pleasure in a single, uneventful, sunny day, or some pretty flowers growing by a brick wall, the charm of a three-year-old playing in a garden, or an evening of intimate conversation among friends. It isn\u2019t that they are sentimental and naive, but precisely the opposite: they have seen how hard things can get, and they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and the sweet \u2013 whenever and wherever these arise.\n\nFolly\n\nThe wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are never far from folly: they have irrational desires and incompatible aims; they are unaware of much of what they feel; they are prone to mood swings; they are visited by powerful fantasies and delusions; they are buffeted by the curious demands of their sexuality. The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing co-existence of deep immaturity and perversity alongside quite adult qualities such as intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes. Aware that at least half of life is irrational, they try wherever possible to budget for madness and are slow to panic when it (reliably) rears its head.\n\nHumour\n\nThe wise take seriously the business of laughing at themselves. They hedge their pronouncements and are sceptical in their conclusions. Their certainties are not as brittle as those of others. They laugh due to the constant collisions between the noble way they would like things to be and the demented way they often turn out.\n\nPoliteness\n\nThe wise are realistic about social relations \u2013 in particular, about how difficult it is to change people\u2019s minds and have an effect on their lives. They are therefore extremely reticent about telling others too frankly what they think. They have a sense of how seldom it is useful to get censorious with others. Above all, they want things to be nice in social settings, even if this means they are not totally authentic. They will sit with someone of an opposite political persuasion and not try to convert them; they will hold their tongue at someone who seems to be announcing a wrong-headed plan for reforming the country, educating their child or directing their personal life. They\u2019ll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others and will search more for what people have in common than what separates them.\n\nSelf-acceptance\n\nThe wise have made their peace with the yawning gap between how they ideally want to be and what they are actually like. They have come to terms with their tendencies to idiocy, ugliness and error. They are not fundamentally ashamed of themselves because they have already shed so much of their pride.\n\nForgiveness\n\nThe wise are comparably realistic about other people. They recognise the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests and seek their own pleasures. It can make others appear extremely \u2018mean\u2019 and purposefully evil, but this would be to over-personalise the issue. The wise know that most hurt is unintentional \u2013 it\u2019s a by-product of the constant collision of competing egos in a world of scarce resources.\n\nThe wise are therefore slow to anger and judgement. They don\u2019t leap to the worst conclusions about what is going on in the minds of others. They will be readier to overlook a hurt from a proper sense of how difficult every life is, harbouring as it does so many frustrated ambitions, disappointments and longings. The wise appreciate the pressures people are under. Of course they shouted, of course they were rude, naturally they want to appear as slightly more important than they are \u2026 The wise are generous in seeing the reasons why people might not be nice. They feel less persecuted by the aggression and meanness of others, because they have a sense of where it comes from: a place of hurt.\n\nResilience\n\nThe wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know just how much can go wrong and yet things will still be (just about) liveable. The unwise person draws the boundaries of their contentment too far out, so that it encompasses, and depends upon, fame, money, personal relationships, popularity, health \u2026 The wise person sees the advantages of all of these, but also knows that they may \u2013 before too long, at a time of fate\u2019s choosing \u2013 have to draw the borders right back and find contentment within a more bounded space.\n\nEnvy\n\nThe wise person doesn\u2019t envy idly: they realise that there are some good reasons why they don\u2019t have many of the things they really want. They look at the tycoon or the star and have a decent grasp of why they weren\u2019t able to succeed at this level. It looks like an accident \u2013 an unfair one \u2013 but there were in fact some logical grounds.\n\nAt the same time, the wise see that some destinies are truly shaped by nothing more than accident. Some people are promoted randomly. Companies that aren\u2019t especially deserving can suddenly make it big. Some people have the right parents. The winners aren\u2019t all noble and good. The wise appreciate the role of luck and don\u2019t curse themselves overly at those junctures where they have not had as much of it as they would have liked.\n\nSuccess and Failure\n\nThe wise emerge as realistic about the consequences of winning and succeeding. They may want to win as much as the next person, but they are aware of how many fundamentals will remain unchanged whatever the outcome. They don\u2019t exaggerate the transformations available to us. They know how much we remain tethered to some basic dynamics in our personalities, whatever job we have or whatever material possession we acquire. This is both cautionary (for those who succeed) and hopeful (for those who won\u2019t). The wise see the continuities across those two categories over-emphasised by modern consumer capitalism: \u2018success\u2019 and \u2018failure\u2019.\n\nRegrets\n\nIn our ambitious age, it is common to begin with dreams of being able to pull off an unblemished life, where one can hope to get the major decisions in love and work right.\n\nBut the wise realise that it is impossible to fashion a spotless life; everyone will make large and uncorrectable errors in a number of areas. Perfectionism is a wicked illusion. Regret is unavoidable.\n\nBut regret lessens the more we see that error is endemic across the species. One can\u2019t look at anyone\u2019s life story without seeing some devastating mistakes etched across it. These errors are not coincidental but structural; they arise because we all lack the information we need to make choices in time-sensitive situations. Where it counts, we are all steering almost blind.\n\nCalm\n\nThe wise know that turmoil is always around the corner, and they have come to fear and sense its approach. That\u2019s why they nurture such a strong commitment to calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement. A day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. They are not afraid of having a somewhat boring time. Things could be, and will be again, so much worse.\n\nFinally, of course, the wise know that it will never be possible to be wise every hour, let alone every day, of their lives.\n\nSee also: Akrasia; Emotional Education; Emotional Intelligence; Faulty Walnut, The; Glamour; Good Enough; Philosophical Meditation; Philosophy; Splitting and Integration; Success at School vs. Success in Life.",

      "content": "### \u00b6 Work/Life Balance\n\nWe have formed ever-higher expectations about what it means to be a good parent in exactly the same historical epoch in which the importance of work has been stressed as never before. The demands of the labour market have not been offset by any reduction in the expectations around intimacy, devotion or time in the home. We are under more pressure to succeed at work and under more pressure to be very continually present and focused domestically.\n\nThe notion of \u2018balance\u2019 has been, rather cruelly, proposed to solve the problem. But the truth is that we can rarely contrive a just accommodation between competing demands. By definition, any worthwhile project will unbalance our lives and demand too much of us. We\u2019d understand the impossibility of society routinely asking us to become experts at chess while also holding down a career as a rally car driver. It is not the fault of the world, or of ourselves, that we don\u2019t see that we are asking ourselves something very similar on a routine basis. Not all good ideals are compatible. A society cannot be highly democratic and highly rational at the same time; a business cannot be daringly innovative and a rock-solid investment. And we cannot be perfect parents and perfect workers. We can, at best, hope to be good enough.\n\nSee also: Expectations; Good Enough; Meaningful Work.",

      "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n\nHOW COULD WE BE ANYTHING BUT\u2026?\n\nIt is, in a sense, astonishing that we ever manage to be anything but very concerned.\n\nThere is so much to which we are exposed, so many serious and unpredictable risks permanently waiting to threaten our peace of mind.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We live on a crowded planet, bathed in an atmosphere of dread, frenzy and ambition, and are forced to navigate around our vast technology-filled cities with a biological makeup better suited to a simpler, quieter, less excitable life in the savannah.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We dwell within painfully fragile physical envelopes, where something could give way at any time, a blood clot smaller than a full stop having the power to destroy us in an instant.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are repeatedly compelled to make enormous life choices without the necessary facts and can have little clue what really awaits us around the corner.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our long childhoods leave us open to every kind of turmoil and dislocation, our beautifully complicated minds being at risk of permanent trauma due to scars that we might have acquired before we could walk.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is seldom sufficient time to connect with the quieter parts of ourselves or to grasp our uplifting unimportance in the grander scheme. We barely notice ourselves living. Our mass media continuously inflames our passions and fears while blinding us to the quiet, steady, undramatic kindness and hope all around us.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relationships, we long to let down our guard but, at the same time, fear \u2013 not unreasonably \u2013 the grave hurt that may ensue whenever we surrender our emotions to another person.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We put children on the earth and cannot be happy unless they thrive \u2013 and yet have no ability to protect them from fate.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At work, our reputations could be destroyed in a moment by malice or error. We want desperately to win and yet are continually haunted by the spectre of defeat. We are never as young, beautiful or intelligent as we need to be.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our imaginations permanently remind us of everything that is missing, everything that might go wrong and everything that we might already have messed up.\n\nFrom a clear-eyed perspective, the risks and troubles that face us are truly multitudinous and petrifying. Yet still people will sometimes casually tell us to \u2018relax\u2019 \u2013 as though such an injunction might be the work of a moment rather than the achievement of a lifetime.\n\nNevertheless, for all this, we should strive with deep seriousness to let go of one or two of our anxieties \u2013 by understanding them a little better, forming good habits to appease them and sharing them with a few kindly others \u2013 and thereby grow to enjoy the odd less worried day, when we can look up for a moment from our fretful thoughts and appreciate the wonder and blessing of being alive.\n\nThis is a book about anxiety and how to overcome it.",

      "content": "## ANXIETY & EVOLUTION\n\nWe\u2019re used to singing the praises of the human mind and body; they are, from many perspectives, truly astonishing pieces of engineering. We have brains capable of doing fractal equations, translating Finnish into Bengali and performing La traviata \u2013 and bodies that can scale the Matterhorn, send balls over a tennis net at 263km/h and create new life that can last up to a century. And yet, for all that, we should admit how questionably designed we truly are in many areas, if only to forgive ourselves for the mess and sadness we typically generate. It\u2019s not simply our fault that we\u2019re anxious; the machines we\u2019re trying to live through are riddled with flaws.\n\nWe are the outcome of evolutionary processes that have left us less than ideally adapted for what is required of us. Our anatomy is filled with redundant or vestigial organs. We have no need for our coccyx, the last part of our vertebrae that is the remnant of the tail that now gives us backache and growing pains. Nor do we have any use for our wisdom teeth, male nipples or appendices. And comparable vestigial problems exist in the mind:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our wiring is massively and awkwardly oversensitive to our childhoods. Most of us still haven\u2019t dealt with our early years by the time we reach old age.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We tend to be unhelpfully mean towards ourselves. We\u2019re far kinder to most of our enemies \u2013 largely because we internalise methods of self-judgement that are modelled on some of the sternest judges from our personal histories.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re very bad at thinking: we panic easily, we resist important thoughts, we long for distraction and are squeamish interpreters of ourselves. We have a devilishly hard time working out what job we might do, how we might tap our talents and what is truly driving us.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We get wildly over-concerned about some threats while ignoring others, especially the threat of not appreciating what we have while there is still time. We can\u2019t correctly separate the real dangers from the false alarms.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We worry far too much about the consequences of others\u2019 views of us; we behave as if we still dwell in small tribes, where every piece of gossip could matter, and waste years improving our image in the minds of strangers we will never meet.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We exaggerate our chances of happiness \u2013 and suffer from bitter disappointment as a result. We can\u2019t gracefully accept just how likely it is that we won\u2019t be rich or won\u2019t have happy marriages \u2013 and rail at the unfairness of our condition, which is, in fact, just the statistical norm.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have addictive tendencies, especially for food, alcohol, pornography and sitting on sofas.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We think of sex far too often, given the opportunities and our competing priorities.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And finally, of course, we are entirely biased towards being unhappy. Very little in our biology is interested in us being content. There must have been an early evolutionary advantage in being fretful and easily triggered: the others got eaten. Nature, apparently, would prefer we were worried ninety-nine percent of the time rather than lived in a relaxed way and fell prey to a tiger. So, we let the finest days pass without appreciation.

      "content": "## ANXIETY & MODERN TIMES\n\nWe\u2019ve built a much safer and more prosperous world than our ancestors ever enjoyed, but modern times have also brought a special range of troubles into our lives that contribute to our enhanced anxiety.\n\nPerfectionism\n\nThe modern age is ambitious. We wish to cure disease, waste no time, achieve constant happiness and live forever. These are fine hopes, but because they are necessarily still out of reach, they leave us angst-ridden, dispirited, disappointed with ourselves and angry with our societies. For most of history, people suffered greatly, but they were spared one particular agony: the sense that a perfect life could somehow be possible.\n\nIndividualism\n\nFor most of history, we lived in close-knit groups. The modern world has removed our reliance on the clan or the family and moved us to big cities where we can live privately and prosper on our own. We exist in an age of individualism. This may have liberated us in many ways, but it has also left us free to suffer alone and endure life without an anchor, feeling overly responsible for whatever befalls us and with no one to blame for our sorrows but ourselves.\n\nProfessional obsession\n\nThe modern world is fixated on work. No social encounter can pass without the question of what we \u2018do\u2019 being raised \u2013 and only with a sufficiently impressive or elevated answer do we count as a valid and interesting person. Our self-esteem hangs upon our performance in an uncertain and random economy. Being nice is not enough. It is not surprising that the first great sociologist to investigate suicide \u2013 \u00c9mile Durkheim \u2013 discovered that the more focused on work a society becomes, the more its rate of suicide rises. It is not poverty or illness as such that drive us to the ultimate act of despair \u2013 it is the sense that we don\u2019t mean anything outside of what we\u2019ve been able to achieve.\n\nMeritocracy\n\nModern societies firmly believe in the concept of meritocracy; that is, the faith that we should be free to make a success of our lives if we have sufficient talent and energy and that there should be no obstacles to our efforts based on class, gender or race.\n\nHowever, this very well-meaning idea carries with it some alarming implications, for if we are to believe that those at the top truly deserve their success, then those at the bottom must truly deserve their failure. Under the aegis of a meritocratic worldview, an element of justice enters into the distribution of penalties as well as rewards. We move from thinking of the poor as \u2018unfortunates\u2019, deserving of compassion and kindness, to thinking of them as something far harsher: \u2018losers\u2019.\n\nA society that thinks of itself as meritocratic converts poverty from a condition of honourable, if painful, bad luck into evidence of personal incompetence. The burden of failure rises exponentially.\n\nThe media\n\nWe\u2019re surrounded by a mass media that is hysterical, disaster-focused and vengeful in tone. It permanently gives us a sense that the outside world is extremely dangerous, that other people are mad or violent, that everyone is mean and that our societies are spiralling towards anarchy and degeneracy. Furthermore, the media holds up for ridicule and condemnation people who have made mistakes and thereby contributes to a feeling that no one ever deserves forgiveness or understanding.\n\nNature\n\nNature used to play an incidental role in keeping us calm. We were never far from the perspective-giving sight of a giant vista or an unspoilt landscape. Our attention would, in the past, frequently have been drawn to non-human elements, stopping us thinking of what happened to us as the measure of all things. Nowadays, we have no such relief. We live in concrete cages surrounded by millions of our own species; we have identified humans as the most important things that exist. It\u2019s a move that can be cast as a liberation, but it has unleashed claustrophobia and panic. There are now few established points of reference beyond us. What happens to us here and now in the city is framed as overwhelmingly important; it is all there is. And so everything that goes wrong, everything that frustrates or disappoints us, fills the horizon. The idea of something bigger, older, mightier, wiser and less known to which we owe love and attention has been stripped of its power to console us. We are seldom without our phones.",

      "content": "## BASIC TRUST\n\nThe greatest psychological achievement we might try and aim for in relation to anxiety is what has been termed \u2018Basic Trust\u2019.\n\nBasic Trust means that even though we can never know for certain what will happen, though we have no absolute guarantees as to how things will turn out, though we cannot wholly control our destinies and though there are some very uncomfortable dangers lurking in certain places, we maintain a belief that things are going to be \u2013 more or less \u2013 OK. They might not be so every day \u2013 there will be rocky moments ... sadness or despair \u2013 but, broadly speaking, we have a gut sense that we\u2019ll pull through.\n\nImportantly, this cannot ever be a firm knowledge; it is \u2013 in the true sense \u2013 a faith, a resilient belief in our survival and endurance outside of definitive evidence.\n\nThis Basic Trust might not sound like much but it is, in fact, the secret to a bearable existence.\n\nThis faith is, for most of us, a gift rather than any form of personal achievement, a gift bestowed on us by a childhood spent in the company of someone who felt (long before we were capable of it) Basic Trust in turn. When a drink was spilt, they didn\u2019t panic; they fetched a cloth and mopped it up. When there was a knock at the door at an unexpected moment, they didn\u2019t jump in surprise. When there was a reversal at work, they took it in their stride. When we felt angry and confused, they saw the bigger picture, interpreted us with benevolence and took us in their arms. And from these examples, we derived a sense that we dwelt among people on whom we could depend.\n\nBut many of us did not receive such a childhood. That is (probably) why we are here.\n\nYet importantly, the wisdom we didn\u2019t see acted out as toddlers can, with a little luck, be picked up in adulthood. Through a lot of thought, patience and introspection, we may come to a point where we too build up a bit of faith in the solidity of our circumstances, where we can take a few risks with people and with ourselves, where we don\u2019t need to be terrified of every new encounter or every new day \u2013 and where we can accept that even though we can\u2019t anticipate the whole future, we will be able to cope with whatever it happens to deliver.",

      "content": "## TRAUMA & ANXIETY\n\nAnxiety belongs in every life. But in some lives, we can fairly say that it has become so constant that it is unnecessarily punishing. What can explain persistent, high-level anxiety that goes far beyond ordinary worry?\n\nWe might venture that somewhere in the history of the constantly worried, the bit of our mental equipment designed to distinguish between modest and extreme danger has taken a hit. The very worried have \u2013 somewhere along the line \u2013 received such a fright that pretty much everything has now grown frightening. Every slightly daunting challenge becomes a harbinger of the end; there are no more gradations. The party where one knows no one, the speech to delegates, the tricky conversation at work\u2026these put the whole of existence into question. Pretty much every day is a crisis.\n\nLet\u2019s go in for a metaphor. Imagine that at a formative moment, when the very anxious would have been profoundly unprepared and without the resources to cope, they had an encounter with a bear. The bear was beyond terrifying. It raged, it stamped, it crushed. It threatened to destroy everything; it was incomprehensibly, mind-defyingly awful. As a result, the anxious person\u2019s inner alarm jammed into the \u2018on\u2019 position and has stayed stuck there ever since. There is no use casually telling this person that there aren\u2019t any bears around at the moment, that this isn\u2019t the season, that most bears are kind or that campers rarely encounter them; that\u2019s easy for you to say, you who were never woken up by a giant grizzly staring at you with incisors showing and giant paws held open for the kill.\n\nThe result of this bear encounter is an unconscious commitment to catastrophic generalisation; the very anxious fear all bears, but also all dogs, rabbits, mice and squirrels, and all campsites and all sunny days, and even associated things, like trees rustling in the wind, or prairie grass, or the smell of coffee that was being made shortly before the bear showed up. The very anxious can\u2019t do logical distinctions: They can\u2019t rank threats accurately.\n\nTo start to dig ourselves out of the quicksand of worry, we \u2013 the very, very anxious \u2013 need to do something that is likely to feel artificial and probably rather patronising too. We need to learn \u2013 on occasion \u2013 to distrust our senses completely. These senses, which are mostly terrific guides to life, have to be seen for what they also are: profoundly unreliable instruments, capable of throwing out faulty readings and destroying our lives. We need to erect a firm distinction between feelings and reality: to grasp that an impression is not a prognosis, and a fear is not a fact.\n\nOne side of the mind has to treat the other with a robust, kindly scepticism: \u2018I know you\u2019re sure there is a bear out there (at that party, in that newspaper article, in that office meeting). But is there one really? Really really?\u2019 Emotion will be screaming \u2018yes!\u2019 as if one\u2019s life depends on it. But we\u2019ve been here before and we need, with infinite forbearance, to let the screaming go on a little \u2013 and ignore it entirely. The cure lies in watching the panic unfold and in refusing to get involved in its seeming certainties.\n\nWe need to be like a pilot of a sophisticated aircraft coming into land in deep fog on autopilot \u2013 their senses may tell them that a dreadful collision is imminent, but their reason knows that the sums have been done correctly and that a smooth landing is, despite the darkness and the awful vibrations, about to unfold.\n\nTo get better, which really means to stop dreading bears everywhere, we need to spend more time thinking about the specific bear that we once saw. The impulse is to focus always on the fear of the future. But we need instead to direct our minds back to the past \u2013 and revisit certain damaging scenes with compassion and in kindly company. A consequence of not knowing the details of what once scared us is a fear of everything into the endless future. What sort of bear was it; what did it do to us; how did we feel? We need to relocalise and repatriate the bear, to get to know it as a spectre that happened at one point in one place, so that it can stop haunting us everywhere for all time.\n\nThat we were once very scared is our historical tragedy; the challenge henceforth is to stop giving ourselves ever-new reasons to damage the rest of our lives with fear.\n\nAnother way to put it is that the very scared are traumatised. Psychological trauma can be defined as a negative event so overwhelming that one cannot properly understand, process or move on from it \u2013 but, and this is the devilish aspect to it, nor can we easily remember it or reflect upon its nature and its effects on us. It is lodged within but remains hidden from us, making its presence known only via symptoms and pains, altering our sense of reality without alerting us to its subterranean operations.\n\nPredictably, a lot of psychological trauma happens in childhood. Children are especially vulnerable to being traumatised, because they are congenitally unable to understand themselves or the world very well \u2013 and have to rely to an uncommon degree on parents who are frequently less than mature, patient or balanced. A child may, for example, be traumatised by a parent who \u2013 through no particular fault of their own \u2013 becomes heavily depressed shortly after childbirth. Or a child may be traumatised through exposure to a parent\u2019s titanic rage or violence. Or, because the widest category of psychological trauma is also the most innocuous, a child may be traumatised by what psychologists term \u2018neglect\u2019, which might mean that, at a critical age (between birth and five years old, and especially in the first eighteen months), it was not properly cherished, soothed, comforted and, to use a large but valuable word, loved.\n\nThe leading symptom of trauma is fear. Traumatised people are, above anything else, scared. They are scared of getting close to others, of being abandoned, of being humiliated and disgraced, of falling ill, probably of sex, of travelling, of their bodies, of parties, of key bits of their mind and \u2013 in the broad sense \u2013 of the world. The legacy of having been traumatised is dread, an unnameable, forgotten, unconscious memory of terror and fear projected outwards into a future. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott observed: \u2018The catastrophe one fears will happen has already happened.\u2019 That is why, in order to find out the gist of what might have occurred to us long ago, we should ask ourselves not so much about the past (we won\u2019t directly be able to remember), but about what we are afraid will happen to us going forward. Our apprehension holds the best clues as to our history.\n\nCrucially, and surprisingly, it can take a very long time before traumatised people even realise they are such a thing. A leading consequence of trauma is to have no active memory of what was traumatic \u2013 and therefore no sense of how distorted one\u2019s picture of reality actually now is. Traumatised people don\u2019t go around thinking that they are unnaturally scared; they just think that everything is terrifying. They don\u2019t notice their appallingly low sense of self-worth; they just assume that others are likely to mock and dislike them. They don\u2019t realise how uncomfortable intimacy is; they merely report not being happy in this or that relationship. In other words, trauma colours our view of reality but, at the same time, prevents us from noticing the extent to which we are peering at life through a distorted lens.\n\nOnly with a lot of time, luck, self-reflection and perhaps the odd breakdown do traumatised people come to a position where they start to notice that the way they think of the world isn\u2019t necessarily the way it actually is. It is a vast step towards mental well-being to be able to be usefully suspicious of one\u2019s first impulses and to begin to observe how much fear and self-hatred one is bringing to situations that truly don\u2019t warrant them.\n\nProcessing trauma usually works best when we can hook up our own malfunctioning and distorted brain to another more clear-sighted one \u2013 and can test our readings of reality against those of a wise friend or therapist. We stand to recognise that \u2013 to our great surprise \u2013 we are not perhaps inherently disgusting; maybe not everyone hates us; perhaps everything isn\u2019t headed for disaster; maybe we are not in line for a horrific punishment. And, crucially, if we do suffer reversals, maybe we could find our way out of them, because we are (and this can come as a true revelation) now adults, not a nine-month-old infant who underwent something awful.\n\nOvercoming trauma is the work of years \u2013 but the beginning of the end starts with a very small step: coming to realise that we might actually be traumatised and that the world may not be the dark, overwhelming and dread-filled place we had always assumed it had to be.",

      "content": "## TRAUMA EXERCISE\n\nThe leading symptom of trauma is to be daily tortured by a feeling of imminent catastrophe. Something terrible seems about to happen to us:\n\nWe\u2019re going to be abandoned.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be shamed and humiliated.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be publicly mocked.\n\nWe\u2019re going to lose physical control over ourselves.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be seen as a loser, weirdo or monster.\n\nThe fear of such imminent catastrophes leads to a state of hypervigilance, where we are permanently on the alert, permanently worried, permanently scared and permanently really very unhappy. People may try to reassure us, but reassurance goes nowhere; the terror remains.\n\nOne way to break the deadlock is to try to go back to the catastrophe that has been forgotten and that is making us sick with worry. If the future is to get brighter, we will need to remember the catastrophe and locate it where it really belongs: safely, but also poignantly and tragically, in the past.\n\nIt is strange that we should have forgotten the catastrophe. But that\u2019s the point with trauma; it disappears from memory. It is too painful to be held in active consciousness, to be processed and verbalised \u2013 and it therefore gets pushed into the unnameable, unknown zones of the mind, where it creates ongoing havoc.\n\nTo start to master trauma, we can reverse engineer a picture of what must have happened long ago, in years that we can\u2019t now easily think about; we can take what we fear of the future and picture that a version of this terror has actually already unfolded. The best clue as to the nature of our difficult past lies in our fears of the future.\n\nImagine filling in a simple table. Start with the left-hand column first.\n\nThe logic of the exercise dictates that we should, for every entry in the left-hand column, be able eventually to think of an entry in the right. Bringing this to the surface is liable to be immensely difficult. One can\u2019t do it on command. It requires time, very relaxed circumstances, perhaps music, a long train or plane journey, a chat with a friend or therapist, a night or two when one stays up very late with a pad and paper and no phone and just thinks while the rest of the world sleeps.\n\nBut, eventually, some memories are likely to resurface, along with a lot of sadness and (ideally) compassion for oneself. One isn\u2019t about to be revealed as a monster; one was \u2013 already \u2013 made to feel like a monster. One isn\u2019t about to be abandoned, one was already left\u2026\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that there is never anything to be afraid of in the present. But we have to draw a distinction between abject terror and fear. There are things to fear in the here and now, but these aren\u2019t things to be terrified of \u2013 and for one central reason: because we are adults and it is the privilege of adults to have a basic freedom, agency and independence. We can take action, were bad things to occur to us, in a way that children who were traumatised never could. Life may yet get very tricky for us, but we never need be as terrified of it as we were when the original catastrophe occurred.\n\nMost likely, nothing as bad as we have feared will ever occur, not because we are lucky but because we were very unlucky in the past \u2013 and it is this bad luck, rather than something in the real world, that is leading us to be so unjustly and so cruelly afraid of living today. With sufficient exploration of the past, the terror of what is ahead could \u2013 just \u2013 be relocated to the category of historic trauma where it truly belongs.",

With great kindness and no disrespect, we may step past the objective content of anxiety and look instead at something else: how the anxious person feels about themselves.\n\nAn unexpected cause of anxiety is self-hatred. People who have grown up not to like themselves very much at all have an above average risk of suffering from extremes of anxiety, for if one doesn\u2019t think one is worthy, it must \u2013 by a dastardly logic \u2013 follow that the world is permanently and imminently at high risk of punishing one in the way one suspects one deserves. It seems to fit that people may be laughing behind one\u2019s back, that one may soon be sacked or disgraced, that one is an appropriate target for bullying and rejection and that persecution and worse may be heading towards us. If things seem to be going well, this must just be the deceptively quiet period before others are about to realise their error and mete out some horrific punishment. For the self-hating, anxiety is a pre-emptive anticipation of the pain one unconsciously feels one is owed; very bad things must and should happen to very bad people.\n\nPart of the problem, and one of the curious aspects of the way our minds work, is that it isn\u2019t always clear that one is even suffering from low self-esteem; hating oneself has just become second nature rather than an issue one has the will to rebel against or even so much as notice. To tease out the sorrow and start to feel it again (as a prelude to treating it), one might need to fire a few questions at oneself.",

It suggests that when panic next descends, one should not spend too long on the surface causes of the worry but instead try to address the self-hatred fuelling the agitation.

      "content": "## TRIGGERING & ANXIETY\n\nIf we were totally sane, we would respond to the present only on its own terms; we would worry or give way to anxiety only as much as the circumstances before us actually dictated.\n\nBut, of course, most of us are not-quite-sane, as evidenced by the way that we respond with such disproportion to certain events in the here and now. We have occasional tendencies to get wildly more worried and anxious than we should if we were simply following the facts in front of us.\n\nWhat causes us difficulty is that we are wired to feel and respond according to precedent rather than on the basis of a dispassionate evaluation of the present. In particular we follow emotional tracks laid down in the distant past \u2013 when many of us were victims of deeply unrepresentative and unusually painful experiences, from which we continue to make panicky, gloomy and unhelpful extrapolations. In other words, we are, to use the inelegant but useful contemporary term, easily (far too easily) \u2018triggered\u2019. That is, situations in the present elicit from us with undue haste responses formed by, and frankly better suited to, a past whose details we have forgotten and whose distinctiveness we cannot now perceive.\n\nA tricky but not objectively existentially troubling email will hence convince us at once that this is the end. An item in the news will plunge us immediately into devastating guilt or boundless fury. The prospect of a party we have to go to or a speech we need to give brings on unbudgeable, monumental terror.\n\nThe triggering happens so fast that there is no chance to observe the process and see the way in which we cede our powers of evaluation from present to past. Our minds are simply flooded with panic, we lose our bearings, the rational faculties shut down and we are lost, perhaps for days, in the caverns of the mind. Even worse, not only are we not thinking straight, we\u2019re not quite aware that we aren\u2019t doing so. We mistake our agitated assumptions for sober truths. We\u2019re too panicked to notice that we are in a panic; we insist on our own stability of mind. So, whereas we should logically take to bed and declare ourselves unfit to think or plan ahead, we continue to sit in the cockpit of our lives and try to steer a judicious course.\n\nWe get triggered because we don\u2019t have a direct link to objective reality. Each of us approaches the outer world through the prism of an inner world with a more or less tenuous connection to it. In this inner world of ours lies a repository of expectations formed through our unique histories: our internal working models, or our best guesses, of what the outer world will be like, how others will respond to us, what they will say if we complain and how things will turn out when there is a challenge.\n\nCrucially, and this is what we of course miss when we have been triggered, the inner world isn\u2019t the outer world. It contains generalisations and extrapolations from a past that may be far harder, stranger and more dangerous than the present. Psychologists have a handy rule of thumb to alert us to the disproportionate side of our responses: if we experience anxiety or anger above a five out of ten, they tell us, our response is likely to be fuelled not by the issue before us, but by a past we\u2019re overlooking. In other words, we have to believe (contrary to our feelings) that the alarm isn\u2019t ringing for any good reason.\n\nThe best way to free ourselves from being so easily triggered is to refuse to believe in most of what overwhelmingly and rapidly frightens or angers us. We must learn to adopt a robust suspicion of our first impulses. It isn\u2019t that there is nothing scary or worrying in the outer world whatsoever, simply that our initial responses are liable to be without proportion or without calculation of adult strength, resilience, resourcefulness or options. We should learn \u2013 at points \u2013 to try not to think at all until we\u2019ve had a chance to drain the panic from our minds \u2013 or else to seek out other minds not as afflicted as ours in order to check our assumptions against theirs. Does it seem to them that the world is coming to an end? Do they think the police really are about to knock on the door? We need to calibrate our thoughts against those of a more equitable temper.\n\nAnother way to approach our panic and anxiety is to remember that, despite appearances, we are not a single person or unified \u2018I\u2019. We are made up of an assemblage or a blend of parts dating right back to our earliest days. In a way we can\u2019t easily track, different events will engage with different parts of us. Some of our most troubled moments are when a difficulty in the present isn\u2019t handled by an adult part, but by a part formed when we were six months or three years old. We end up so scared because the challenge of public speaking or of a seduction or a worry at work has, unbeknownst to the adult part of us, been left in the hands of a very scared toddler.\n\nIn the circumstances, it can help to ask ourselves at points not what \u2018we\u2019 are afraid of but what a \u2018part\u2019 of us is worried about \u2013 and to learn more carefully to differentiate the parts in question. What might we tell a part of us in order for it not to be so scared?\n\nIt is a milestone of maturity when we start to understand what triggers us and why \u2013 and take steps to mitigate the most self-harming of our responses. Whatever our past seems to tell us, perhaps there won\u2019t be a catastrophe, perhaps we\u2019re not about to be killed or humiliated unbearably. Perhaps we have adult capacities for survival. Too much of our past is inside us in a way we don\u2019t recognise or learn to make allowances for. We should dare to approach many of our triggers like a starting pistol or a fire alarm that we will from now on, for well-grounded reasons, refuse to listen to.",

      "content": "## DIVERSIONARY ANXIETY\n\nOne of the most difficult features of anxiety is that it tends to be all-consuming. It squats in the middle of our minds and refuses to let anything else in or through. Though the anxiety causes us great pain, it denies any attempts to be questioned, analysed, probed or reconfigured. We are both terrified and unable to think beyond our terror. Our thoughts become low, relentless, repetitive, stymied things: returning again and again to the issue of whether the door is locked, the accounts were signed off or the social media account is not under attack. Anxiety dominates and excludes any other form of mental activity; all that will be in our minds is terror. Impregnable and bullying, anxiety in effect shuts down our central faculties.\n\nBut there is one nimble way to try to outwit anxiety \u2013 and that is with a question that recognises a fundamental feature of anxiety: that it is frequently a smokescreen for something else, something beyond what we consciously think is worrying us, that we\u2019re in fact concerned with or sad about.\n\nOne of the peculiar facets of our minds is that we may choose to feel anxious rather than to confront things that may be yet more painful or emotionally awkward in our lives. It can be easier to fret than to know ourselves properly.\n\nWe might feel anxious about whether we\u2019re going to get to the airport on time as an escape from the greater challenge of wondering whether this holiday is even worth it and whether our spouse still loves us. Or we might get intensely anxious about a financial issue in order to avoid a trickier acknowledgement of our confusion at the course of our emotional lives. Or we may develop a sexual anxiety as an alternative to thinking about our sense of self-worth and the childhood that destroyed it. Panic may be invited to shield us from more profound sources of self-aware agony.\n\nAnd yet, of course, we are always better off getting to the root cause of our troubles, rather than filling our minds with diversionary panic \u2013 and in order to do so, we would be wise, at points, to ask ourselves a simple but possibly highly revealing question:\n\n\u2018If your mind wasn\u2019t currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?\u2019\n\nThis question, as simple in structure as it is acute in design, is liable to unlock a moment of original insight.\n\nThe answer might go like this:\n\nI might realise how sad and lonely I am.\n\nI might realise how angry I feel towards my partner.\n\nI might realise how abandoned I feel.\n\nAnd that, of course, is precisely what we should be doing now: processing all the stuff that our anxiety was trying to keep at bay.\n\nCertain anxieties can be taken at face value, for they do clearly relate to worrying things in the world. But there is another class, and a rather large one at that, that is there for no better purpose than to distract us from understanding important parts of ourselves. If we need to suffer, and often we will, the least we can do is to ensure that we are suffering for the right reasons. At points, we should trade our anxiety in for something far more important \u2013 a confrontation with the real ambivalence and complexity of our lives \u2013 and we should do so thanks to a naively simple question:\n\n\u2018If your mind wasn\u2019t currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?\u2019",

      "tags": "reputation, anxiety, stoicism, validation, insecurity",
      "content": "## REPUTATION & ANXIETY\n\nReputation might be defined as the claim that one can make on the goodwill of strangers; it is what your name will mean to those who don\u2019t know you, who spend almost no time thinking of you. It\u2019s what you will get reduced to when you aren\u2019t illuminated by love. How your reputation is assessed depends on the extent to which you have fulfilled, or violated, the ideals and aspirations of your society. Most of us are properly known to, and liked by, five to ten people. When it comes to everyone else, reputation is what will decide what we have been worth.\n\nReputation can\u2019t buy us love, but it can provide us with those valuable proxies: respect, honour and politeness. Those who are kind to us may not mean it, but they are at least making an effort. Not all of us crave equally the warmth that comes with a good reputation. Those with a particularly strong need for applause tend to be those with a weak sense of their own acceptability. The cheer of the crowd is asked to compensate for an innate feeling of shame. We seek the validation of the world when we are, inside, unconvinced that we are quite deserving. The more we have been humiliated, especially when young, the more the goodwill of strangers will matter; and \u2013 conversely \u2013 the more we have tasted genuine affection, the less interesting reputation can be.\n\nThe problem is that reputation is gossamer thin; or like a soapy bubble or an unstable chemical compound, some metaphor to suggest the ease with which it can be torn or destroyed. It is so prone to disappear because it is based not on knowledge or experience of one\u2019s deep self but on the candy floss of hearsay and third-hand gossip. It\u2019s the unconscious supposition of people who haven\u2019t thought very deeply about who one is and have absolutely no wish to do so either; it\u2019s what people who don\u2019t care about us think about us. This is what makes reputation so delightful when it is going our way. Our nobility becomes part of the unthinking common sense of the community. But this is also what makes things so tricky when reputation falls apart. The only way in which our good name might be rescued in the minds of others is if they gave us some thought \u2013 which is precisely what they have never done before and won\u2019t now begin to either.\n\nReputation will rise and fall according to how closely we track or depart from the ideals of our society \u2013 and these tend to be pegged to financial success, sexual propriety, decorum, marriage, sobriety, the sanctity of family and the purity of children. The more of these ideals one flouts, the harsher will be the penalties.\n\nUnfortunately, we are \u2013 all of us \u2013 error-prone animals or, to put it more bluntly, idiots. We should say sorry to the universe every day, given how we are. We\u2019re impulsive, greedy, lustful, vain and selfish. Which means that every year, a small but significant section of the population makes an apparently minor mistake that causes terrible damage to others and blows up their life along the way. Not for nothing does Western civilisation have at its heart the example of Greek tragedy, which tells us of averagely good people brought low by highly understandable, everyday kinds of folly, for which they pay an ultimate price.\n\nThe whole community hears in an instant and one is done for. The punishment may be financial or legal, but the ultimate damage is psychological; one becomes a pariah. In the minds of all those who don\u2019t think about us properly (which is almost everyone), one is now a monster or a numbskull. For life.\n\nFrom now on, we will need to be looked at through the eyes of love before we re-emerge as in any way human; that is, deserving of even a little pity or understanding. Only through love can we be remembered to have once been a baby, who was innocent, who struggled and who later made mistakes from passing weakness rather than evil. Only through love are there any other sides of the story.\n\nAs a result, all those who are not our intimates become sources of sure-fire damning judgement. We know from the outset that they will hate or condemn us. It becomes impossible to go to a party. One probably has to move town. Suicidal thoughts become harder to push away. Ambitions have to change entirely. Everything that depends on the minds of people in general is now impossible. \u2018What people might think\u2019 disappears from the calculation; it\u2019s a foregone conclusion. They\u2019ll think \u2013 always \u2013 that one is a demon.\n\nWhen those in disrepute rediscover close friends and family (and they almost always do), it isn\u2019t coincidental or a cheap excuse: it\u2019s because they can see, more clearly than ever, that these are the people, the only people, who know them properly and can therefore examine them with any degree of subtlety, as one might a character in a novel. For everyone else, one has disappeared into a single word of insult.\n\nIn older, more religious societies, there was the possibility of apology before a divine being, a period of penance and then, eventually, forgiveness. But that is one of the handy mechanisms we unknowingly dismantled when we decided that God was a fiction. We have been left with only one tool, the legal system, which levies fines and prison sentences but isn\u2019t in the business of restoring reputation \u2013 and doesn\u2019t get involved in most of the errors that cause it to be lost in the first place. There is, quite literally, in most cases, no way to recover reputation. The sentence is life-long.\n\nWe suffer also because we live in such vast societies. Recovery of reputation might have been possible when we lived in tribes of a hundred or so. You could go around and explain things in person, tent by tent. No such chance when it\u2019s a case of having a few hundred million minds to change.\n\nSo begins that peculiar challenge, leading a life without a reputation, a feat as arduous, in a way, as hanging on to a cliff-face with bare hands in high wind.\n\nA few moves suggest themselves. For a start, acceptance: of oneself, of the situation, of one\u2019s misdeeds and of the darkness. Then, the construction of a new kind of communal life, one built around astonishing sincerity and vulnerability. One says it like it is. There is no need for yet more shame. A whole new set of friends is called for \u2013 before whom one can be truly oneself, in a way one never could be before things fell apart. It helps immensely if these friends have themselves lost reputation. Ex-convicts might be an idea. And fallen business people and politicians. They will have a kindness to them open only to those who have suffered infinitely for their errors. There is only so much empathy and thoughtfulness that blameless people can ever show. Animals are good too; they rarely judge. The immense open spaces of nature offer valuable perspective, as do history books.\n\nThen one should, above all, make friends with Stoic philosophy in general and the philosopher Boethius in particular. For some 400 years across the European Middle Ages, one philosophy book was prized above any other. Present in every educated person\u2019s library, it was titled in Latin De Consolatione Philosophiae or, as we know it in English today, The Consolation of Philosophy. Editions appeared in all the main European languages: Chaucer translated it into English, as did St Thomas More and Queen Elizabeth I, and Dante made it a centrepiece of the intellectual scaffolding of his Divine Comedy. It is one of the finer things one could read at moments of panic.\n\nThe book was the work of the Italian statesman, scholar and academic Boethius, who penned it in a few months in appalling circumstances in a prison in Pavia in 523 A.D. Boethius was born into a highly successful and wealthy family in the years after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. From an early age he took an interest in the Classics and translated much of Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s works from Greek into Latin; it is thanks, in great measure, to his efforts that classical philosophy made its way into the Middle Ages and then to the modern world.\n\nFor many years, Boethius\u2019s life was seemingly blessed. He lived in a sumptuous villa in Rome and was married to a kind and beautiful woman called Rusticiana, with whom he had two handsome, clever and affectionate sons. Under a sense of obligation to his society, Boethius eventually entered politics and occupied a number of elevated administrative positions under the ruler of Italy, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. Bertrand Russell wrote of him: \u2018He would have been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly amazing.\u2019\n\nBut suddenly, in the spring of 523 A.D., Boethius\u2019s fortune ran out. There was a knock at the door and a gang of Theodoric\u2019s guards accused him (quite falsely) of having plotted against the increasingly paranoid and vengeful king. With scarcely time to say goodbye to his family, Boethius was carted off to prison.\n\nUnknown French Miniaturist, Fortune and Her Wheel: Illustration from Vol.1 of Boccaccio\u2019s De Casibus Virorum Illustrium (On the Fates of Famous Men) [detail], 1467\n\nEntirely innocent, but also aware of the danger he was in, Boethius fell into despair. In a tiny cell, he contemplated his rapid fall from grace, his love for his family and the unfairness of his destiny. What would eventually lift his spirits \u2013 and, at the same time, gift humanity one of its greatest works of prison literature of any time or place \u2013 was his decision to think his way philosophically out of his sorrows.\n\nAs The Consolation of Philosophy opens, Boethius describes his listless sadness and terror at his state: \u2018White hairs are scattered untimely on my head, and the skin hangs loosely from my worn-out limbs.\u2019 But in this downcast state, Boethius receives an unexpected visit: \u2018While I was pondering thus in silence, and using my pen to set down so tearful a complaint, there appeared standing over my head a woman\u2019s form, whose countenance was full of majesty, whose eyes shone as with fire and whose power of insight surpassed that of all men\u2026.\u2019\n\nHis visitor is a metaphorical figure whom Boethius terms Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy is carrying a pile of classical books in one hand and a sceptre in the other \u2013 and she has come to visit Boethius in his cell in order to remind him of some of the fundamental truths of his favourite subject, largely as defined by the Stoic school of Greece and Rome. That she should have dropped in on him was, in a sense, no surprise. In the classical world, philosophy was not an abstract academic discipline; it was a set of tools specifically designed to help one live and die well, with particular relevance at the darkest moments.\n\nLady Philosophy begins by gently chiding Boethius for \u2018flaring up against\u2019 his fate. She reminds him, as Stoic philosophers had constantly stressed, that human beings are not in control of most of what happens to them. Our destiny is, in large measure, in the hands of a devilishly powerful seductive goddess whom the Romans knew as Fortuna, the Goddess of Fortune. This figure was a central deity in the Roman pantheon and was represented across the Roman world on coins and statues. She was typically depicted holding a cornucopia in one hand, overflowing with fruit and luxuries, and in the other a tiller, a marker of her capacity to direct people\u2019s fates. Depending on her mood, Fortune might either shower us with gifts or, with a blithe smile, steer us towards catastrophe.\n\nTo be a philosopher means to understand all that Fortune controls, to resist her blandishments, to know never to put complete faith in the things that are, ultimately, always in the hands of an immoral and reckless force \u2013 and to prepare for the day when we may have to surrender her gifts at a stroke. These gifts comprise most of what we would today think of as the fundamental ingredients of happiness: love, family, children, prosperity, reputation and career. But, for a Stoic philosopher, none of them should be things that the wise should ever really trust \u2013 for all of them can be lost in horrific circumstances at any moment.\n\nLady Philosophy sits with Boethius in his cell and reminds him of his appalling exposure to Fortune\u2019s deceptive charm: \u2018I know the many disguises of that monster, Fortune, and the extent to which she seduces with friendship the very people she is striving to cheat, until she overwhelms them with unbearable grief at the suddenness of her desertion.\u2019\n\nBut Lady Philosophy also reminds Boethius that the wise have to resist putting their faith in the gifts of Fortune. She introduces a famous image of a Wheel of Fortune, which spins between success and favour \u2013 and appalling punishment and pain. Fortune spins the wheel with abandon and merciless cruelty, enjoying the screams of those who, only hours before, were confident of their future.\n\n\u2018If you are trying to stop her wheel from turning, you of all men are the most obtuse,\u2019 Lady Philosophy tells Boethius. \u2018You are seeking to regain what really did not belong to you.\u2019\n\nFortune herself pipes up at this point and says with chilling candour: \u2018Inconstancy is my very essence; it is the game I never cease to play as I turn my wheel in its ever changing circle\u2026. Yes, rise up on my wheel if you like, but don\u2019t count it an injury when by the same token you begin to fall, as the rules of the game will require\u2026. Isn\u2019t this what tragedy commemorates with its tears and tumult?\u2019\n\nLady Philosophy now gets to the heart of her message. Boethius must, like any good philosophically inclined person, stop trusting in anything that Fortune can take away at once: \u2018You know there is no constancy in human affairs, when a single swift hour can often bring a man to nothing. If you are in possession of yourself you will possess something you would never wish to lose and something Fortune could never take away\u2026. Happiness cannot consist in things governed by chance.\u2019\n\nBoethius must retreat to what the Stoic philosophers called his \u2018inner citadel\u2019; a minimal self immune from the cruelty of Fortune. Lady Philosophy stresses that a different sort of happiness can be found by focusing on all that Fortune can never make one lose, specifically one\u2019s powers of reasoning, which give one access to the beauty, mystery and complexity of the universe. True philosophers rise above their immediate circumstances, become indifferent to their own fate and identify with the vast forces of history and nature.\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of the relevance of Boethius\u2019s message that we today so firmly identify happiness with two areas that lie entirely in the hands of Fortune: romantic love and career success. And, unsurprisingly, we are continually let down here, too, the wheel of fortune spinning us randomly from promise to disgrace, from hope to ruin. Boethius\u2019s provocative message to his own times and to our own is that the best way to find peace of mind may be to perceive the ingredients we associate with happiness as, in truth, direct conduits to a fundamental instability, and thereby to inner torment and anxiety.\n\nBoethius\u2019s wisdom was to be the last eloquent outcry of the guiding ideas of classical philosophy and, in particular, its Stoic branch. Thereafter, Christianity subsumed its insights, which were then further obscured by the scientific optimism of the modern period.\n\nOur own troubled times deserve to witness the rediscovery of the Stoic message. We become philosophers not by writing books or attending university courses, but by appreciating how little of our lives is in our hands, the ubiquity and fickleness of Fortune and our need to look beyond public opinion, family, love and status in order to build up serenity through the exercise of one\u2019s distinctive and fate-independent mental powers.\n\nBoethius was killed, as he feared, a few months after being imprisoned. His grave lies in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d\u2019Oro in Pavia, half an hour from Milan. In his honour, we should leave space for Lady Philosophy occasionally to come and visit us \u2013 and, when we are facing the worst turns of Fortune\u2019s wheel, let her strengthen our resolve to depend a little less on what was, in fact, never really ours to rely upon.",

However convenient it would be if people could be born friendly and empathise spontaneously with the pains of others, the awkward truth is that the human mind is too sluggish and selfish an instrument properly to imagine what suffering might look like for someone else until it has been energetically goaded on by its own agonies. Empathy has to be forged by personal suffering. To be a good friend, one has no option other than to have had close-up, personal experience of terrible times. One needs to have known at least a few of the following: illness (physical and mental), humiliation, reversal, bullying, financial disaster, public shaming, childhood neglect, isolation, defeat and panic. One needs to have wept all night, raged at oneself and thought one\u2019s very existence an error. Happy people unmarked by life can be many things: a good friend is not one of them.",

It was their fault\n\nHowever, suffering on its own is not enough, for it may \u2013 at its worst \u2013 simply lead to indignant self-righteousness, whereby the sufferer is convinced that it was everyone else\u2019s fault, that they are pure and the world is bad; in other words, to being a prig. The truly kind friend, however, is someone who has been inducted to a more sombre, important and painful truth still: the knowledge that a lot of what went wrong was their fault. Part of their calamities came down to their idiocy, their narrow-mindedness, their foolishness. They aren\u2019t focused on hating anyone else, they\u2019ve given up pride and blame. They\u2019ve been a blunderhead and they know it. This is what makes the good friend so sympathetic to your errors and slips. They know from the inside how one can be a decent person and yet still unleash disaster. They don\u2019t believe in their own innocence and nor do they in any way demand yours: they just know from experience how much every one of us stands in need of forgiveness and they\u2019re ready to give it to you in spades.\n\n3. They know the world isn\u2019t fair\n\nOne of the fastest ways to turn into a monster is to believe that the world might be fair. If it\u2019s fair, there\u2019s no need to think kindly or imaginatively about the tramp, the prisoner and the outcast. They entirely deserve their fate and damnation. Nor is there any need to be sceptical about what the papers say and who is being lauded as \u2018righteous\u2019 or \u2018noble\u2019; the established value system is obviously correct \u2013 and need only be followed in its entirety. The mob have it right. But the moment one realises that the world is, in fact, hideously random and unfair, that judgements can be corrupt, that rewards don\u2019t neatly track goodness, then everything at once gets a lot more complicated \u2013 and a lot kinder too. Suddenly, the beggar and the outcast might deserve your sympathy and the self-righteous crowd might deserve your scepticism. Good people can end up in trouble. Sinners can be worthy of another chance. The true friend is ready to give unconditional love, because they know the absurdity and cruelty of many of the conditions currently placed on love.\n\n4. They\u2019re beyond ambition\n\nAmbitious people are evidently a huge asset to humanity; they get things done, their self-importance powers history and the progress of society depends on their acute self-regard. When they meet with you for dinner, they\u2019re always subtly keen to let you know how things are advancing for them \u2013 and they keep the score, as though the whole of life were a gigantic school exam and there was a big tick waiting for the winners on the other side of death. What these people can\u2019t be, however, is a good friend, for what that means is surrendering on shining in the eyes of an imagined fancy audience. Good friends don\u2019t give a damn about \u2018what people think\u2019 any more (even if they might have done when younger). They\u2019re out of the \u2018game\u2019 (probably pushed out of it by their own mistakes), and they don\u2019t go after claps or gongs. What they\u2019re interested in, in the time that remains, is sincere communion. They want to hang around with other broken honest people and, without airs and graces, exchange kindness and support. They care about you because \u2013 remarkably, in one of the greatest achievements any human is capable of \u2013 they\u2019ve outgrown any shred of preening fascination with themselves.\n\nTo summarise, the good friend has been humbled, they\u2019ve given up pride, they\u2019ve messed up \u2013 and they\u2019ve drawn all the right conclusions from their troubles: that the only thing that counts is kindness. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going to be so patient with you; that\u2019s why they\u2019ll understand all the things you worry about and that you regret; that\u2019s why they\u2019ll be on hand with compassion, gentleness and plenty of rich dark laughter. If one meets with just one or two such people in a lifetime, one will have been properly blessed and will be a whole lot calmer too.",

      "content": "## COMMUNION & ANXIETY\n\nAnxiety and dread thrive in conditions of loneliness. Not only is one wretched, one feels convinced that one is the only one to feel as such. One\u2019s suffering lacks legitimacy in one\u2019s own eyes. To the affliction of anxiety, the burden of shame is too often added.\n\nThat is why, when anxiety starts to descend, there is one solution that is more effective than any other, that functions faster than any pill, meditation technique or book: talking to someone kind who knows anxiety from the inside. One needs to get oneself \u2013 fast \u2013 into a group and unburden oneself among thoughtful and good-natured people who have been visited by comparable pain, and who can respond to your confessions with infinite understanding. It helps immeasurably to sit with folk who know what it\u2019s like to be terrified, not to dare to leave the house, to panic at work, to be triggered by \u2018small things\u2019 that others would find innocuous and to be bullied mercilessly by one\u2019s own mind.\n\nEvery anxious person would, ideally, equip themselves with a support group and turn to them once a week or more. We\u2019d gather at someone\u2019s house, chat about how things had been going and swap stories of our challenges. We\u2019d in turn recognise some of our most private moments in the stories of others and be granted a rare opportunity to reconceive of ourselves as fundamentally normal and human \u2013 though very much afflicted. Our sufferings do not make us unique \u2013 they provide an essential opportunity to loosen our fears and bind ourselves together around a commitment to mutual assistance and kindness.",

      "content": "## PARTIES & ANXIETY\n\nGoing to parties is meant to be an ordinary and unremarkable activity: for the anxious, it typically presents one of the greatest of all of life\u2019s challenges. The idea of being in a noisy room filled with unpredictable and sometimes unknown others sets off every alarm.\n\nTo begin to calm ourselves down, we deserve to take full stock of just how weird parties actually are when considered objectively. There is nothing normal at all about being expected to feel at ease when one can be observed by dozens of pairs of eyes; when at any moment a \u2018frenemy\u2019 may approach with unwelcome news; when one is expected to feel happy to hear of the good fortune of others; when we have to encounter a random selection of people who may make one feel inadequate and envious\u2026. In evolutionary terms, our brains aren\u2019t well set up to deal with parties. We were made to deal with small groups we might have known since childhood. We are not odd at all for finding parties hugely bizarre and, for the most part, horrifying.\n\nWe should dare to push back against the assumption that it is therefore indispensable for us to attend parties. Perhaps we can, going forward, dare to define ourselves as people who just don\u2019t do parties, as others may resist swimming or heights.\n\nWe can also question whether this means we are in any way antisocial. Modern society pushes the notion that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room; that it means speaking a lot and being notably cheerful about things that have been happening in our lives; that it depends on a jokey manner and \u2013 ideally \u2013 on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences. But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. First, perhaps true sociability \u2013 that is, a real connection between two people \u2013 is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing something that is lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing in an uncensored and frank way a little of the agony and confusion of being alive.\n\nSecondly, true sociability requires honesty. At parties, we are generally under such pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, we are understandably disinclined spontaneously to disclose our true selves. Our default mode is \u2013 without anything sinister being meant by this \u2013 to lie about who we are and what is really going on in our lives. This suggests that a genuinely social occasion might be rather different from what we typically envisage. We think of a \u2018good host\u2019 as someone who makes sure there is enough wine and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other\u2019s names. But, in the profound sense, a good host is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe about being sad, anxious and desperate.\n\nA commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise that we depend on a little artful choreography to get us into the psychological zone in which true connections can unfold. We might need encouragement \u2013 and even a helpful lanyard \u2013 to share a little of what is sad within us. We need help in networking, not in order to find new investment opportunities, but so as to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair.\n\nParties as they are currently structured constitute a clever ruse by a sharp minority, perhaps only ten percent of humanity, to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave. But, in truth, it takes a sharply insular and misanthropic person to feel that what goes on in an average party really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one\u2019s fellow human animal. If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t like other people, rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact to put up with what is on offer at most parties. The mark of a truly sociable person might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.",

      "tags": "panic, anxiety, fear, unworthiness, self-doubt",
      "content": "## PANIC ATTACKS & ANXIETY\n\nDuring a panic attack, the pervasive worry that we normally carry within us, and that is typically content merely gently to corrode away our lives, promptly changes tack and decides it might try to kill us off instead \u2013 preferably very soon.\n\nWe\u2019re meant to give an hour-long speech in a couple of minutes but we stand petrified in the wings of the theatre, our mouth entirely dry, our heart racing and our mind unable to remember so much as the first letters of the alphabet, let alone what our name is.\n\nThe aeroplane doors close and we realise that we won\u2019t be able to get off for six hours, that we can hardly move our legs without touching passengers on every side, that the air we\u2019re breathing has passed through the lungs of 200 other people (and a couple of jet engines too) and that we\u2019re going to be a few miles off the ground \u2013 and the whole situation suddenly seems wholly surreal, tearjerkingly cruel and deeply unsurvivable.\n\nOr we\u2019re at a business meeting, surrounded by colleagues and prospective clients, and we\u2019re made aware that our bowels are about to open or our stomachs to heave their contents across the table and that we\u2019ll be publicly reduced to a pure emanation of noxious sludge \u2013 after which it would evidently be best not to try to continue with one\u2019s life and instead to be taken away, done in and never mentioned again.\n\nWhat are we to do at such moments? What could the most well-wrought philosophy do for us when we\u2019re about to soil ourselves or start wailing uncontrollably at the back of a tightly packed aeroplane?\n\nThere might, in spite of everything, be a few shreds of advice to hold on to: First, we should embrace the situation. Though this seems like the oddest and most embarrassing thing ever to have unfolded, it happens all the time, even to good, decent people who are worthy of respect and will enjoy a lengthy and dignified old age. This is not the end, though \u2013 of course \u2013 it feels exactly like it.\n\nSecond, accept the fear; don\u2019t fight it. It\u2019s like trying to wrestle with the current \u2013 best to let the waves carry one this way and that; they\u2019ll tire eventually and set one back on shore. Never struggle against a rip tide. Accept that maybe the speech won\u2019t happen; you might faint in your seat or be forced to run out of the room. So what? Refuse to be humiliated by the panic. You don\u2019t have to be competent all the time. Everyone is allowed some failures, and this just happens to be one of your well-earned ones.\n\nThird, when calm has returned, try to think all this through, ideally with a kindly friend or therapist. It\u2019s to do \u2013 perhaps in part \u2013 with a baseline sense of unworthiness. You don\u2019t, at some level, feel it\u2019s permissible for you to give a speech and impress a hundred people or succeed in your career. Maybe, in your unconscious, this might make someone (a parent?) feel jealous or inadequate \u2013 and it\u2019s kinder, therefore, to stick to being small and unobtrusive.\n\nTo which the answer is to reassert, in the light of day, the basic truth that you have every right to exist and draw pleasure from this life, that there is nothing illegal about having a positive effect on others, that you can be a decent colleague, friend, parent and citizen \u2013 and make it to the bathroom on time.\n\nYou are allowed to be.\n\nAlso, consider that the panic might have to do with a memory of long ago having been appallingly controlled, hurt and not allowed to get away. It\u2019s an aeroplane door that has just closed but, in the unconscious mind, it\u2019s perhaps also symbolic of a return to other situations of powerlessness that were unmasterable and continue to haunt you.\n\nTo which the answer is to go back to the past, understand it fully and drain it of its power to upset the present. The memories need to be heard and the trauma digested. Meanwhile, the plane is going to take off and the doors will eventually open again and one will be free to go wherever one wants because one is now an adult, with all the agency and liberty that word should imply.\n\nOr maybe what powers your terror is a feeling that you have to impress other people and won\u2019t be forgiven if you don\u2019t. To which the answer is that you\u2019re OK just as you are; the days of having to impress are over; you need to prove nothing at all. There is no need to let self-contempt keep tearing you apart.\n\nFourth, at the height of the fear, it can help to get deeply but redemptively pessimistic about everything. Though it seems like everything matters intensely, gloriously, in truth, nothing matters at all. Almost every human on the planet is entirely indifferent to you. Out in the Mojave Desert, scorpions are scuttling among the rocks; an eagle is soaring above the Karakoram Pass; up there in the universe, the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are completing their orbits. You will soon enough be dead, properly inert rather than merely scared, and it will have been as if you never existed. You are but a blip in eternal cosmic time; whether your speech unfolds well or badly, or you soil your trousers or not, is a matter of sublime, beautiful indifference to planet Kepler-22b, 587 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t avoid everything that scares you; don\u2019t let the panic reduce you. Don\u2019t accord the fear so much respect that you start to listen to its tyrannical dictates.\n\nAnswer the aggression within every panic attack with its opposite: a deeply unconditional love towards you, its unfortunate, blameless, worthy and loveable victim.",

      "content": "## PUBLICITY & ANXIETY\n\nIt is natural to assume, at the outset of adult life, that being well known to others will help one to feel grounded, liked and safe. One will be exchanging the coldness of anonymity for the embrace of the world; long years of indifference by parents, siblings or school mates can be compensated for by a wider, more enthusiastic fraternity. Wherever one shows up, people will start to know who one is, and be a little impressed, without one having to explain too much. One will be the recipient of the near-automatic kindness and goodwill of strangers; one will, finally, with luck, fit in.\n\nIt\u2019s with such hopes in mind that one can be drawn to set up a social media account and share carefully curated thoughts and images with a growing band of followers. Or seek to make a name for oneself in sport, business or the arts. Or run for public office or a company leadership role. And with talent and a good headwind, one may, however modestly, start to become a little \u2018known\u2019 (that is, asymmetrically known to people one doesn\u2019t know oneself).\n\nIt may feel rather nice for a little while \u2013 but, soon enough, one is liable to come face to face with one of the less-often acknowledged facets of being in the public eye: the envy, resentment and eventual hatred of others (a sufficient number of others to create genuine agony). Every increase in one\u2019s own visibility generates \u2013 by a kind of inevitable emotional calculus \u2013 a degree of humiliation for those still in relative obscurity and therefore a momentum in sections of the audience to attack one\u2019s character in order to return to the status quo. There is no public success that does not, simultaneously, lead certain people to experience new feelings of failure \u2013 and so to develop desires for vengeance and comeuppance. As one\u2019s star rises, so too other people (perhaps initially obscured and reticent), often in one\u2019s own field or cohort, will experience themselves as more inadequate and abandoned and so willing to find revenge.\n\nAt some point, one will make an error. It might be very small and quite understandable, except that rather than being forgiven and understood (as one might be by friends), one will find oneself at the receiving end of an extraordinary outpouring of anger, sanctimony and moralism. The bullying will begin \u2013 and though it might at first appear accidental and passing, one will discover an iron-clad law of publicity: that one cannot ever be reliably loved and steadily approved of by large numbers of strangers without being assailed by the resentment of others. The newspaper clippings and social media accounts will attest to as much, containing as they will constant references to one\u2019s flaws and apparent vileness. One will hope that the enemies will eventually tire, but so long as one is known, one will be tormented.\n\nThe search for publicity is, at heart, a quest for a shortcut to friendship. Yet real kindness is never available in a public arena. It is the fruit of a few intimate and reciprocal connections. It cannot be won remotely or one-sidedly. If it is safety one seeks, one must definitively and immediately cease to strive to be known to people one doesn\u2019t know and concentrate instead on building up genuine bonds that can survive one\u2019s errors and endure for life. Paradoxically and poignantly, it is most often the very anxious who feel a particular longing for the embrace of fame; but it is especially they (given their fragility) who should be warned away from its ultimately always vengeful arms. Being entirely forgotten by the world is no curse or sign of failure; it is the very basis for a contented and safe life in which one swaps the prospect of acolytes and mean-minded detractors for the deeper satisfaction of true friends. The moment anyone becomes famous should always be considered \u2013 by those who really care for them \u2013 as a time for mourning.",

      "content": "## PLAN BS & ANXIETY\n\nWe grow up \u2013 inevitably \u2013 with a strong attachment to a plan A: that is, an idea of how our lives will go and what we need to do to achieve our particular set of well-defined goals. For example, we\u2019ll do four years of law school, then move out west, buy a house and start a family. Or, we\u2019ll go to medical school for seven years, then go to another country and train in our speciality of interest and hope to retire by fifty. Or, we\u2019ll get married and raise two children with an emphasis on the outdoors and doing good in the world.\n\nBut then, for some of us, and at one level all of us, life turns out to have made a few other plans. A sudden injury puts a certain career forever out of reach. A horrible and unexpected bit of office politics blackens our name and forces us out of our professional path. We discover an infidelity or make a small but significant error that changes everything about how crucial others view us.\n\nAnd so, promptly, we find we have to give up on plan A altogether. The realisation can feel devastating. Sobbing or terrified, we wonder how things could have turned out this way. By what piece of damnation has everything come to this? Who could have predicted that the lively and hopeful little boy or girl we once were would have to end up in such a forlorn and pitiful situation? We alternately weep and rage at the turn of events.\n\nIt is for such moments that we should, even when things appear calm and hopeful, consider one of life\u2019s most vital skills: that of developing a plan B.\n\nThe first element involves fully acknowledging that we are never cursed for having to make a plan B. Plan As simply do not work out all the time. No one gets through life with all their careful plan As intact. Something unexpected, shocking and abhorrent regularly comes along, not only to us, but to all human beings. We are simply too exposed to accident, too lacking in information, too frail in our capacities, to avoid some serious avalanches and traps.\n\nThe second point is to realise that we are, despite moments of confusion, eminently capable of developing very decent plan Bs. The reason why we often don\u2019t trust that we can is that children can\u2019t so easily \u2013 and childhood is where we have all come from and continue to be influenced by in ways it\u2019s hard to recognise. When children\u2019s plans go wrong, they can\u2019t do much in response: they have to stay at the same school, they can\u2019t divorce their parents, they can\u2019t move to another country or shift job. They\u2019re locked in and immobile.\n\nBut adults are not at all this way, a glorious fact that we need to keep refreshing in our minds and draw comfort from in anxious moments. We have enormous capacities to act and to adapt. The path ahead may be blocked, but we have notable scope to find other routes through. One door may close, but there truly are many other entrances to try. We do not have only one way through this life, even if \u2013 at times \u2013 we cling fervently to a picture of how everything should and must be.\n\nWe\u2019re a profoundly adaptable species. Perhaps we\u2019ll have to leave town forever, maybe we\u2019ll have to renounce an occupation we spent a decade nurturing, perhaps it will be impossible to remain with someone in whom we had placed great faith.\n\nIt can feel desperate \u2013 until we rediscover our latent plan B muscle. In reality, there would be a possibility to relocate, to start afresh in another domain, to find someone else, to navigate around the disastrous event. There was no one script for us written at our birth, and nor does there need to be only one going forward.\n\nIt helps, in flexing our plan B muscles, to acquaint ourselves with the lives of many others who had to throw away plan As and begin anew: the person who thought they\u2019d be married forever, then suddenly weren\u2019t \u2013 and coped; the person who was renowned for doing what they did, then had to start over in a dramatically different field \u2013 and found a way.\n\nAmidst these stories, we\u2019re liable to find a few people who will tell us, very sincerely, that their plan B ended up, eventually, superior to their plan A. They worked harder for it, they had to dig deeper to find it and it carried less vanity and fear within it.\n\nCrucially, we don\u2019t need to know right now what our plan Bs might be. We should simply feel confident that we will, if and when we need to, be able to work them out. We don\u2019t need to ruminate on them all now or anticipate every frustration that might come our way; we should simply feel confident that, were the universe to command it, we would know how to find a very different path.",

      "content": "## LOVE & ANXIETY\n\nAs is often the case with anxiety, when it comes to relationships, we have a habit of making potentially somewhat frightening situations far worse by downplaying the challenges that are at play.\n\nA good relationship requires that we take a series of unambiguously daunting steps. We are required to give another person the keys to our affection, to our sense of self and to our power to thrive as autonomous beings. We need to make space for them in our bed, in our friendships and in our routines. Along the way, we cede to them the power to upset us with a slightly offhand remark or late response, and the power to devastate us by deciding to call it a day (let alone by holding the hand of a colleague on a business trip). Our anxieties are compounded by any susceptibility to worry created in our minds by our childhood; perhaps these hold experiences of relationships not working out, of parents who argued viciously in front of us, or separated before we could understand why. We may have grown into adults for whom the spectre of the collapse of a relationship is charged with some of the heightened emotion of a bruised and defenceless child. Our societies focus relentlessly on the upsides of the start of love; we would do well to have some sympathy for the terrors.\n\nUnfortunately, when we are scared in love, we have vicious tendencies not to recognise the fact in ourselves \u2013 and so to make a hash of explaining our fears to others. Rather than gently laying out that we dread the partner\u2019s absence or the occasional insecurity of not knowing quite how they feel about us, we may instead go in for avoidant patterns of behaviour, whereby we claim to be wholly indifferent at precisely the moments when we are most worried and longing for reassurance. Unsure of their love, we insist on our independence \u2013 which can provoke them to pull up their drawbridge in turn, initiating a cycle of mutual withdrawal. Or else we may, in the face of our fears of their shifting emotions, try to pin them down procedurally: asking them where they were last night with uncharming suspicion, complaining bitterly if they were a minute late calling us and nagging them to carry out a succession of household chores, which we frame as verdicts on the state of our relationship.\n\nHow much better it always is to identify the fear in oneself and share it open-heartedly and guilelessly with our partner. How much more seductive to say \u2018I\u2019m frightened of losing you\u2019 than to behave as though one doesn\u2019t care or has turned into a chore-monster. We underestimate the strength we immediately acquire upon admitting that we\u2019re presently feeling very weak.\n\nOf course it is terrifying to be in love; that is, to depend on another person we don\u2019t control for our happiness. We should never make our anxieties worse by being under any illusion that they shouldn\u2019t exist. A contented couple should make regular room, perhaps as often as once a day, for a discussion around the theme of, \u2018What scares me about depending on you is\u2026\u2019. That would be the start of a properly relaxing, and loving, way to live.",

      "content": "## SEX & ANXIETY\n\nThe anxieties of love may be compounded by even more tortured feelings around sex \u2013 another topic about which we are expected, implausibly, not to be scared.\n\nBut how foolish to assume that it might not be anything other than very complicated to take one\u2019s clothes off in front of someone and attempt to make love with them. Far from being the uninhibited and liberated free spirits that the adverts suggest we all are, many of us bear important legacies of shame around the expression of our sexualities.\n\nOur capacity to express our sexual selves confidently and happily, our ability to say what we want and to ask for it without embarrassment, are enormous psychological achievements. They are also generally only available to those among us who enjoyed highly supportive and emotionally evolved early environments. For us to be sexually untroubled adults requires that, way back, others will have left us feeling acceptable to ourselves: enjoying a sense that our bodies and their functions were natural and fine things, that we were not naughty or sinful for expressing curiosity about ourselves and that it was (for example) more than a good idea to be, at the age of two, properly delighted by the strange and wondrous existence of one\u2019s own bottom.\n\nSexual desire is one of the most personal and vulnerable things that we are ever called upon to express \u2013 and it exposes one to potentially momentous degrees of ridicule. As bullies of all kinds have always known, if you want to destroy someone fast, shame them about their sexuality; they\u2019ll never have the self-confidence to challenge you again. There are few things more deeply \u2018us\u2019 than our longing for sexual connection; therefore, any feelings of unworthiness \u2013 any worries about how nice we are, how deserving we may be or how legitimate it is that we exist \u2013 have a sure habit of cropping up in the bedroom and of destroying our ability to be straightforward and unconflicted sexual beings. To generalise crudely, if there is any danger of us feeling bad about ourselves, we\u2019re going \u2013 by a psychological inevitability \u2013 to feel bad about ourselves and sex. What get called sexual problems \u2013 impotence, vaginismus, lack of desire, harmful addictions \u2013 are, first and foremost, always problems of self-hatred. And one can\u2019t, as a rule, both hate oneself and be having a terrific time in bed.\n\nBeginning to repair the problem of sexual shame relies on a basic acceptance that the problem exists and can play havoc with our lives. We need to learn to name and track the matter; despite suggestions to the contrary, a lot of us, women and men, are right now walking the earth intensely ashamed of ourselves sexually \u2013 not because what we want sexually is in any objective way \u2018bad\u2019 (that is, disgusting or willingly hurtful to someone else), but because our histories have predisposed us to feel so negatively about our own selfhood.\n\nA central effect of sexual shame is to silence us. We are so embarrassed that we cannot even speak of our embarrassment. It is of huge importance therefore to dare to put our feelings into words and to seek out warm-hearted, broad-minded people with whom we can, in safety, finally admit to our inhibitions \u2013 and learn to see ourselves through eyes that are not biased, judgemental or uncaring.\n\nTo take a measure of how much shame we are carrying within us, we might along the way ask ourselves a few poignant questions to which we might not have pleasant answers:\n\nHow do you feel about your own body?\n\nHow sorry do you have to feel for a person having sex with you?\n\nCould someone know you sexually, properly know you, and still like you?\n\nIn a caring, mutually supportive environment, our acceptance of our sexuality is one of the most generous and mature acts we\u2019re capable of. We \u2013 the ashamed ones \u2013 deserve to rediscover sex not as a zone of guilt and anxiety but as an intensely fulfilling, innocent and, in the profound sense, \u2018fun\u2019 pastime, something we truly deserve to enjoy in the same way that, despite early intimations to the contrary, we truly deserve to exist.",

      "content": "## SIMPLICITY & ANXIETY\n\nIt is well understood by good parents that life should only ever get so exciting for a baby: after friends have come around and brought presents and made animated faces, after there has been some cake and some cuddles, after there have been a lot of bright lights and perhaps some songs too, enough is enough. The baby will start to look stern and then burst into tears and the wise parent knows that nothing is particularly wrong (though the baby may by now be wailing): it is just time for a nap. The brain needs to process, digest and divide up the welter of experiences that have been ingested, and so the curtains are drawn, baby is laid down next to the soft toys and soon it is asleep and calm descends. Everyone knows that life is going to be a lot more manageable again in an hour.\n\nSadly, we exercise no such caution with ourselves. We schedule a week in which we will see friends every night, in which we\u2019ll do twelve meetings (three of them requiring a lot of preparation), where we\u2019ll make a quick overnight dash to another country on the Wednesday, where we\u2019ll watch three films, read fourteen newspapers, change six pairs of sheets, have five heavy meals after 8pm and drink thirty coffees \u2013 and then we lament that our lives are not as calm as they might be and that we are close to mental collapse.\n\nWe refuse to take seriously how much of our babyhood is left inside our adult selves \u2013 and, therefore, how much care we have to take to keep things simple and very, very calm. What registers as anxiety is typically no freakish phenomenon; it is the mind\u2019s logical, enraged plea not to be continuously and exhaustingly overstimulated.\n\nWhat are some of the things we may need to do to simplify our lives?\n\nFewer people, fewer commitments\n\nIt is theoretically a privilege to have a lot of people to see and things to do. It is also \u2013 psychologically speaking \u2013 exhausting and ultimately rather dangerous.\n\nThe manner of expression is a little dated and brutal, and one might want to quibble over the exact timings, but this point from Friedrich Nietzsche remains acute: \u2018Today, as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official or a scholar.\u2019\n\nWe need to recognise that what is physically possible for us to achieve in a day is not psychologically wise or plausible. It may well be feasible to nip over to a foreign capital or two in a day, and run a company alongside managing a household, but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if such routines ultimately contribute to a breakdown.\n\nSleep\n\nPlenty of it, of course: at least seven hours. Or, if we can\u2019t manage it, we need at a minimum to recognise fully how much we are deprived, so that we won\u2019t aggravate our sorrows by searching for abstruse explanations for them. We don\u2019t necessarily have to get divorced, retrain in a completely different profession or move country: we just need to get some more rest.\n\nMedia\n\nWhat we\u2019re taking in when we check our phones is perhaps the single greatest contributor to our mental ill-health. For most of history, it was inconceivable that there could ever be such a thing as \u2018too much news\u2019. Information from political circles or foreign countries was rare, prized and expensive (it was as unlikely that one could gorge oneself on it as one could on chocolate bars). But since the middle of the twentieth century, news has been commodified and, in the process, it has become a major \u2013 though still too little known \u2013 risk to our mental survival.\n\nEvery minute of every day presents us with untold options for filling our minds with the mania, exploits, disasters, furies, reversals, ambitions, triumphs, insanity and cataclysms of strangers around our benighted planet. Always, news organisations speak of our need to know \u2013 and our need to know right now. But what they have left out is our equally great, and often even greater, need not to know: because we cannot change anything, because the stories are too violent, dispiriting and sad, because our minds are fragile, because we have responsibilities closer to home, because we need to lead our own lives rather than be torn apart by stories of the lives of others who are ultimately as remote from and irrelevant to us as the inhabitants of the Egyptian court of King Sneferu in late 2613 B.C.\n\nNutrition\n\nIt is maddening to be told this constantly and in such specific and ever-changing detail, but we do \u2013 in brief \u2013 have to eat less, and simpler things too. The exact details of an anxious person\u2019s diet are perhaps for others to argue about, but suffice to say that it should probably involve some hazelnuts, slices of apple, olives, apricots and coarse bread. The body needs long periods unoccupied with any sort of physical digestion to stand a chance of tackling the endless peculiar fruits of its turbulent mind.\n\nThinking\n\nInsomnia and anxiety are the mind\u2019s revenge for all the thoughts we refuse to have consciously in the day. In order to be able to find rest, we need to carve off chunks of time where we have nothing to do other than lie in bed with a pad and paper in order to think. We need to consider three topics in particular:\n\nWhat is making me anxious?\n\nWho has caused me pain and how?\n\nWhat is exciting me?\n\nWe need to sift through the chaotic contents of our minds. Every hour of living requires at least ten minutes of sifting. We need to orient ourselves in the ongoing story of our lives by (as it were) writing its next few paragraphs.\n\nWe should do some anticipatory thinking as well. On another sheet of paper, we should write, \u2018What is coming up\u2019. With some of the same patience as a parent taking a child through what it will need to do at school the next day (as has already been established, we need to be better parents to ourselves), we should anticipate the challenges ahead: what time we\u2019ll need to order the taxi, how we\u2019ll need to schedule some calls, what it might feel like to have a grim conversation with a colleague. Experiences lose at least half of their power to unnerve us when we have gone through them in our minds the day before. We need to recover a sense of the seriousness and dignity of making lists.\n\nExpectations\n\nOf course, it might be pleasant to be extraordinary, famous and world-beating, but maybe it will be an even greater achievement to stay sane and kind. We might opt not to conquer the world in favour of living a longer and more serene life. We are not backing away from a challenge; we\u2019re shifting our sense of what the real challenge might be \u2013 and, more importantly, where the real rewards may lie. A quiet life isn\u2019t necessarily one of resignation or flight; it may constitute a supremely wise recognition that the truly satisfying things are available away from the spotlight and the big cities, on modest salaries and as far as possible from the manic, sleepless competition to \u2018win\u2019 the professional status race.\n\nBeauty\n\nIt would be deeply helpful if we could be calm whatever the view was like or however our room was decorated. But we are, as we\u2019re establishing, far more sensitive than that. Just as it may help a baby if its room is a gentle shade of lilac, so too it will help our inner state immeasurably if there are very few objects in our visual field and if the ones that are there are in visual harmony (ideally with some bilateral symmetry and repetition of forms). Outer mess inflames any tendency to inner confusion\n\nThe visual world can\u2019t magically translate itself into a mood, but it can certainly foster and invite one. We need to take every step we can to make a home in the sort of environment that promises at a visual level the calm we crave at a psychological one.\n\nAs we\u2019re discovering, excitement is fun for a time; but it also kills. Simplicity is true wisdom.\n\nWe need more naps and more white rooms.",

      "content": "## OVERTHINKING & ANXIETY\n\nThe temptation, when we are worried, is to direct our determined intelligence to trying fully to anticipate whatever may be coming for us down the line. We try to strip the unknown of its surprises; we seek, quite understandably, to do nothing less than control the future.\n\nThis is far from foolish; there is lots to be learnt from arduous anticipation and rational planning. But, after we have weighed up all possible prognoses and taken every step these might reasonably demand, there is also a moment to confront an apparently maddening, but in reality \u2013 if we can approach it from the right angle \u2013 highly releasing, thought: we can\u2019t ever tell exactly what will happen to us and nor should we try. A great part of our lives lies in the hands of the unknown, in the current of time, in the province of fate. Our minds, however impressive, cannot peer into the future and wrestle it of every last ambiguity. We are subject to too many variables. Our mental telescopes only permit us to see so far. We must learn to sleep on the pillow of doubt.\n\nTo help us foster the right kind of scepticism, we should equip ourselves with an attitude of benevolent trust in the face of our ignorance. One of its clearest expressions in Western culture can be found in the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St Matthew, where Jesus \u2013 in his Sermon on the Mount \u2013 recommends that we quell our anxieties as to where precisely our next meal will come from by looking at the behaviour of birds:\n\n\u2018Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither\n\ndo they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly\n\nFather feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\u2019\n\nWe don\u2019t need to believe in a divine creator, or indeed relinquish every sensible attempt to forward plan, to see the wisdom of the point. For all the astonishing powers of our minds, there is a critical role for knowing how to switch them off in the face of uncertainty. We should not torture ourselves with manic, insistent rumination on what cannot yet be known or commanded.\n\nUnknown Flemish painter, Landscape with Cows, circa 1870\n\nBeneath Christianity, we sense the origins of such trust: in our childhood experience of fathers and mothers who imbued us with a confidence to navigate the uncharted future, who had faith that we would find a little place to eat along the way, even if we didn\u2019t know its name right now. It is never too late to fill in for the absence of such lessons. We can replace God with terms like nature, fate or the universe. We can\u2019t tell exactly what will have happened by next year, what the outcome of the test is going to be, who we will love, how our career will pan out or when we will die. But what we can trust is that, whatever unfolds, we will \u2013 broadly \u2013 be fine. Even death is endurable.\n\nAmongst Nietzsche\u2019s more unusual loves were cows, whom he considered the most philosophical of all the animals. In a section of Thus Spake Zarathustra, he wrote: \u2018Unless we change (or be converted) and become as cows, we shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.\u2019 What lent the cows their particular wisdom in Nietzsche\u2019s eyes was their advanced capacity not to worry overly about their own futures; they knew how to sit quietly in a field, occasionally swatting away a determined fly, chewing strands of meadow grass and taking each minute as it comes. For all their mental limitations, they had achieved something the human mind is extremely bad at: resigning itself to the limits of what can plausibly be known and leaving the rest aside. The real symbols of a thinking life should not, in this vein, be a volume of Montaigne or Plato, but a well-positioned and suitably reverential image of a cow.\n\nWe hear no end of reminders as to the benefits of intellectual work. We need, along the way, to rediscover the art of knowing when to cease trying to think.",

      "content": "## STOICISM & ANXIETY\n\nThere is, in our quest to master anxiety, a need to face down our fears, to refuse to be cowed and tortured by them \u2013 a defiant will not to be defeated by our malignant worries. There may well be an alarm ringing in our head, warning us against new plans and occasions, but we may choose not to listen to it. It can ring all it likes; we may by now have had enough of being bullied by it.\n\nPart of this facing down of anxiety involves a rather surprising move: thinking about the very worst in a great deal of detail \u2013 in order to realise that we could, if need be, cope with it. Even if all our circumstances were thrown into reverse, we could survive. Anxiety feeds off our impression of our vulnerability: our sense that we need perfect health, a great reputation, an unblemished record, a lot of money, happiness and love in order to exist. But we can go in the opposite direction and ask ourselves with new rigour what it would be OK not to have, a question that isn\u2019t popular with merchandisers but is exceptionally useful for us to turn over, especially in bed at night. We know it could always be better, but in what ways could it be worse, and still \u2013 despite everything \u2013 bearable?\n\nRather than shunning thoughts of disasters, we should drain them of their power to scare us by being entirely at home with them. We should think through every bad scenario until we\u2019re almost bored and thereby closer to indifference. Anxieties thrive by not being thought about, by festering in the dank corners of the mind; they demand that we pay them attention but hate us to think through them properly. So, we need to introduce them to the bright sunshine of focused thought, give ourselves a pad of paper, plenty of time to reflect and encouragement to ask ourselves: So what would it be if like if X or Y happened\u2026?\n\nAnd we will tend to find that even if X or Y did come to pass, it would be survivable. The worst, the very worst that can happen is that we die, an eventuality that has happened to a lot of people already and \u2013 it appears \u2013 they coped well enough.\n\nThese kinds of thoughts belong to Stoicism, a philosophy it is hard not to fall back on when dealing with anxiety. Arguably the greatest, and certainly the most prolific, Stoic philosopher was the Roman author and statesman Seneca, who was born in 4 B.C. in Spain and died in 65 A.D. in Rome.\n\nA lot of Seneca\u2019s thought is known to us from the letters he wrote to his friends, giving them counsel at times of trouble. Seneca had a friend called Lucilius, a civil servant working in Sicily. One day Lucilius learnt of a lawsuit against him that threatened to end his career and disgrace his good name. He wrote to Seneca in a panic.\n\n\u2018You may expect that I will advise you to picture a happy outcome, and to rest in the allurements of hope,\u2019 replied the philosopher, but \u2018I am going to conduct you to peace of mind through another route\u2019 \u2013 which culminated in the advice: \u2018If you wish to put off all worry, assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen\u2019.\n\nThis is an essential Stoic tenet. We must always try to picture the worst that could happen \u2013 and then remind ourselves that the worst is survivable. The goal is not to imagine that bad things don\u2019t unfold; it is to see that we are far more capable of enduring them than we currently think.\n\nTo calm Lucilius down, Seneca advised him to make himself entirely at home with the idea of humiliation, poverty and ongoing unemployment \u2013 but to learn to see that these were, from the right perspective, not the end of everything. \u2018If you lose this case, can anything more severe happen to you than being sent into exile or led to prison?\u2019 asked the philosopher, who had himself survived bankruptcy and eight years of exile in Corsica. \u2018Hope for that which is utterly just, and prepare yourself for that which is utterly unjust.\u2019\n\nSeneca gave Lucilius a meditation to mull over in the luxury of his home that he was now in danger of losing:\n\n\u2018I may become a poor man; I shall then be one among many. I may be exiled; I shall then regard myself as born in the place to which I shall be sent. They may put me in chains. What then? Am I free from bonds now? Behold this clogging burden of a body, to which nature has fettered me!\u2019 Seneca tells us that we must grow familiar with, and hold before us at all times, not just the sort of events we like to plan for, that are recorded in living memory or are common in our age group and class, but the entire range of possibilities \u2013 a longer and inevitably far less agreeable list that finds space for cataclysmic fires, sackings and deaths.\n\n\u2018Nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to meet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen. Let us place before our eyes in its entirety the nature of man\u2019s lot ... not the kind of evil that often happens, but the very greatest evil that can possibly happen. We must reflect upon fortune fully and completely.\u2019\n\nAt one point, a friend of Seneca\u2019s lost a son, and the consoling thoughts ran in a similar direction. Marcia, a lady of a senatorial family, was devastated by the death of her son Metilius, who was not yet twenty-five. She fell into a period of mourning that seemed to have no end. Three years after his death, her sorrow had not abated; indeed, it was growing stronger every day.\n\nSo, Seneca sent her an essay in which he expressed the hope that, given the length of time that had elapsed since Metilius\u2019s death, she would forgive him for going beyond the usual condolences to deliver something darker, but perhaps more effective.\n\nTo lose a son was surely the greatest grief that could befall a mother, but, given the vulnerability of the human frame, Metilius\u2019s early death had its place in a merciless natural order, which daily offered examples of its handiwork.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018We never anticipate evils before they actually arrive, but, imagining that we ourselves are exempt and are travelling a less exposed path, we refuse to be taught by the mishaps of others that such are the lot of all. So many funerals pass our doors, yet we never dwell on death. So many deaths are untimely, yet we make plans for our own infants: how they will don the toga, serve in the army and succeed to their father\u2019s property.\u2019\n\nThey might end up doing such things, but how mad to love them without remembering that no one had offered us a guarantee they would grow to maturity, let alone make it to dinner time.\n\n\u2018No promise has been given you for this night \u2013 no, I have suggested too long a respite \u2013 no promise has been given even for this hour.\u2019If Metilius\u2019s death had been unexpected for Marcia, it was only on the basis of a wishful assessment of probabilities.\n\n\u2018You say: \u201cI did not think it would happen.\u201d Do you think there is anything that will not happen, when you know that it is possible to happen, when you see that it has already happened to many?\u2019\n\nSeneca imagined meeting Marcia before her birth and inviting her on a tour of the troubled earth so that she could weigh up the terms of life, then choose whether or not to accept them. On the one hand, Marcia would see a planet of awe-inspiring beauty; on the other, a place of constant, unspeakable horror. Would Marcia choose to step into such a world? Her existence suggested her answer. In which case, would she not now have to bow to the real terms of earthly life?\n\nImportantly, the Stoics and Seneca thought that if things were really unendurable, we had no obligation to continue forever:\n\n\u2018The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can\u2026. He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are numerous events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he sets himself free. And this privilege is his, not only when the crisis is upon him, but as soon as Fortune seems to be maltreating him; then he looks about carefully and sees whether he ought, or ought not, to end his life on that account.\n\n\u2018He holds that it makes no difference to him whether his taking off be natural or self-inflicted, whether it comes later or earlier. He does not regard it with fear, as if it were a great loss; for no man can lose very much when but a driblet remains. It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. And dying well means escape from the danger of living ill.\u2019\n\nSeneca was not advocating random or thoughtless exits; he was attempting to give us more courage in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always within our remit, when we have genuinely tried everything and rationally had enough, to choose a noble path out of our troubles.\n\nHe was seeking to strip willed death of its associations with pathology and to render it instead an option that the wise always know is there as a backstop.\n\nWhen we are furious, paranoid, depleted or sad, the philosophy of Stoicism is on hand \u2013 as it has been for 2,000 years \u2013 to nurse us with its hugely fortifying, distinctive and unusual wisdom and friendship.\n\nManuel Dom\u00ednguez S\u00e1nchez, The Death of Seneca, 1871",

      "content": "## ARRIVAL & ANXIETY\n\nWhat most of us long for above all else is \u2018security\u2019, the sense that we are \u2013 at last \u2013 safe on the earth. We pin our hopes for security on a shifting array of targets: a happy relationship, a house, children, a good profession, public respect, a certain sum of money.\u2026 When these are ours, we fervently believe we will finally be at peace. We may mock the term \u2018happily ever after\u2019, synonymous as it is with naive children\u2019s literature, but in practice we do, indeed, tend to live as if we could one day, somewhere over the horizon, reach a place of rest, satisfaction and safety.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore worth trying to understand why happiness \u2018ever after\u2019 should be congenitally so impossible. It isn\u2019t that we can\u2019t ever have a good relationship, a house or a pension. We may well have all this \u2013 and more. It\u2019s simply that these won\u2019t be able to deliver what we hope for from them. We will still worry in the arms of a kind and interesting partner, we will still fret in a well-appointed kitchen, our terrors won\u2019t cease whatever income we have. It sounds implausible \u2013 especially when these goods are still far out of our grasp \u2013 but we should trust this fundamental truth in order to make an honest peace with the forbidding facts of the human condition.\n\nWe can never properly be secure, because so long as we are alive, we will be alert to danger and, in some way, at risk. The only people with full security are the dead; the only people who can be truly at peace are under the ground. Cemeteries are the only definitively calm places around.\n\nThere is a certain nobility in coming to accept this fact \u2013 and the unending nature of worry in our lives. We should both recognise the intensity of our desire for a happy endpoint and at the same time acknowledge the inbuilt reasons why it cannot be ours.\n\nWe should give up on the Arrival Fallacy, the conviction that there might be such a thing as a destination, in the sense of a stable position beyond which we will no longer suffer, crave and dread.\n\nThe feeling that there must be such a point of arrival begins in childhood, with a longing for certain toys; then the destination shifts, perhaps to love, or career. Other popular destinations include children and family, fame, retirement or (even) \u2018after the novel is published\u2019.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that these places don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s just that they aren\u2019t places that we can pull up at, settle in, feel adequately sheltered by and never want to leave again. None of these zones will afford us a sense that we have properly arrived. We will soon enough discover threats and restlessness anew.\n\nOne response is to imagine that we may be craving the wrong things, that we should look elsewhere, perhaps to something more esoteric or high-minded: philosophy or beauty, community or art.\n\nBut that is just as illusory. It doesn\u2019t matter what goals we have: they will never be enough. Life is a process of replacing one anxiety and one desire with another. No goal spares us renewed goal seeking. The only stable element in our lives is craving; the only destination is the journey.\n\nWhat are the implications of fully accepting the Arrival Fallacy? We may still have ambitions, but we\u2019ll have a certain ironic detachment about what is likely to happen when we fulfil them. We\u2019ll know the itch will start up again soon enough. Knowing the Arrival Fallacy, we\u2019ll be subject to illusion, but at least aware of the fact. When we watch others striving, we may experience slightly less envy. It may look as if certain others have reached \u2018there\u2019. But we know they are still longing and worrying in the mansions of the rich and the suites of CEOs.\n\nWe should naturally try to give the journey more attention: we should look out of the window and appreciate the view whenever we can. But we should also understand why this can only ever be a partial solution. Our longing is too powerful a force. The greatest wisdom we\u2019re capable of is to know why true wisdom won\u2019t be fully possible \u2013 and instead pride ourselves on having at least a slight oversight on our madness.\n\nWe can accept the ceaselessness of certain anxieties and rather than aim for a calm, yogic state, serenely accept that we will never be definitely calm. Our goal should not be to banish anxiety but to learn to manage, live well around and \u2013 when we can \u2013 heartily laugh at, our anxious state.",

      "content": "## DETACHMENT & ANXIETY\n\nThe majority of our lives requires us to be heavily invested in our own ego, its pleasures, sufferings and ambitions. But we are also capable, at rare moments, of accessing a mood of detachment in which what exactly happens to us, who we are and what we are capable of cease to be of such primary and tortuous concern \u2013 and we are able to look out at the world as if we were not so condemned to be so tightly connected to ourselves.\n\nIn such moods of detachment, which can take place particularly at night, often in the vastness of nature, practical concerns are, for a time, kept wholly at bay and we accede to an unnerving yet thrillingly oblique perspective on existence. We might be driving down a deserted motorway or looking down at the earth from a plane tracing its way across Greenland. It might be high summer or a deep winter evening. The essential element is that we are able to look \u2018beyond the ego\u2019. Helped along by the sound of flowing water or the call of a distant owl, the habitual struggle ceases, we are freed from our customary egoistic vigilance and we can do a properly extraordinary thing: look at life as if we were not us, as if we were a roaming eye that could inhabit the perspective of anyone or anything else, a foreigner or a child, a crab on a seashore or a cloud on the hazy horizon. In our detached state, the \u2018I\u2019, the vessel that we are usually supremely and exhaustively loyal to, ceases to be our primary responsibility. We can take our leave and become a roaming, vagabond, promiscuous thing, a visitor of other mentalities and modalities, as concerned with all that is not us as we are normally obsessed by what is.\n\nAs a result, a range of emotions that we would typically feel only in relation to us can be experienced around other elements too. We might feel the pain of someone we hardly know, or be gratified by the success of a stranger. We could take pride in a beauty or intelligence to which we were wholly unconnected. We can be imaginative participants in the entire cosmic drama.\n\nThere might, in all this, be a particular emphasis on love. That could sound odd, because we\u2019re used to thinking of love in a very particular context, that of the circumscribed affection that one person might have for a very accomplished and desirable other. But understood properly, love involves a care and concern for anything at all. We might find ourselves loving \u2013 that is, appreciating and delighting in, understanding and sympathising with \u2013 a family of dung beetles or a moss-covered tundra, someone else\u2019s child or the birth of a faraway star. An intensity of enthusiasm that we usually restrict to only one other nearby ego can be distributed more erratically and generously across the entire universe and all its life forms.\n\nNo longer so closely wedded to ourselves, we cease to worry overly about what might happen to our puny and vulnerable selves in the always uncertain future. We may be readier to give up on some of our jealously guarded and pedantically held goals. We may never get to quite where we want to go, but we are more prepared to bob on the eddies of life, content to let events buffet us as they may. We make our peace with the laws of entropy. We may never be properly loved or appropriately appreciated. We\u2019ll die before everything has been achieved \u2013 and that will be OK.\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, a particular gaiety might descend on us, for a huge amount of our energy is normally directed towards nursing our ego\u2019s wounds and coping with what we deep down suspect is the utter indifference of others. But that no longer seems like a spectre we have to ward off and we can start to raise our eyes and notice life in a way we never otherwise do. Our invisibility and meaninglessness is a given we now joyfully accept, rather than angrily or fearfully rage against. We don\u2019t quake in fear that we might not be a somebody; we embrace the full knowledge of our eternal nullity \u2013 and delight that, right now, the blossom looks truly enchanting in the field opposite.\n\nWe cannot persist at a detached plane at all times; there will inevitably be bills to be paid and children to be picked up. But the claims of the ordinary world do not invalidate or mock our occasional access to a more elevated and disinterested zone, in which the burden of being us is momentarily lifted and, with the usual thrum of anxiety stilled, we can pay due heed to what is always there, waiting for us to be in a state to notice: the wonder and beauty of existence.",

      "content": "## HAPPINESS & ANXIETY\n\nGiven how much we all long to be happy, we might presume that accepting the possibility of happiness in our lives would be an uncomplicated, serene and automatic process. But for many of us, however theoretically attached we might be to the notion of being happy, the possibility of actually being so is liable to trigger deep ambivalence and fear. We would \u2013 it appears \u2013 often prefer to be worried and sad rather than attempt to take on the risks surreptitiously connected in our minds with positive moods. We may \u2013 however paradoxical it sounds \u2013 be nothing less than afraid to be happy.\n\nAs ever, our fear has a history that begins in childhood, where one of the following is likely to have occurred. Someone we deeply loved, and perhaps admired too, was unhappy. Their sorrow moved us profoundly and led us to identify with them so that our caution around contentment continues to function as a secret tribute to them. To be happy would, in a way that would pain us profoundly, mean being disloyal. However much they might on the surface have encouraged us to venture out and seize opportunities for joy, an important part of us wishes to stay with them under the canopy of grief. So without knowing we\u2019re doing this, we ensure that we will always have a modest career because they never had educational possibilities, or we turn down sexual opportunities because they were sexually neglected. Alternatively, someone we were close to might have been jealous of us and led us to want to downplay our achievements and hide our contentment \u2013 in order to feel safe from their envy and rage. Or perhaps we were badly let down by someone in whom we had once placed a lot of hope \u2013 and now it feels more appropriate to anticipate a blow rather than be surprised by one. We learnt to associate gloom with safety and joy with risk. More generally, we may have lacked any plausible role models for happiness. We may have grown up in an environment where being anxious and panicky was the default state, where it seemed natural to picture the plane crashing, the police showing up, the business collapsing and the mole turning malignant. We may be intellectually aware that there could be other ways to interpret the future, but equanimity doesn\u2019t feel like what our tribe does. To this resistance, we might have added a layer of intellectual superiority. Deep in our hearts, we might suspect that happiness is for the little people, and that the leading symptom of understanding the world intelligently must be sadness.\n\nAll such positions contribute to a psyche where the onset of happiness is a cause for grave and glaring alarm. When we are finally on holiday, in love, surrounded by friends or free of financial pressure, we panic. Our senses have been jammed for so long in fear mode they are filled with dread when the alarm stops wailing.\n\nTo return to a more balanced state, we\u2019re liable systematically to sabotage the conditions of contentment. We start working on holiday and soon uncover a cause for concern at the office; within hours, we may be protesting that we need to return home. Or else we do our utmost to convince a new lover that we\u2019re not worth it, by seldom calling them or (if they really don\u2019t get the message) having an affair. It feels so much more normal to be abandoned.\n\nIn order to acclimatise ourselves to joy, we need to return to the past and unpick how we learnt to use anxiety as a defensive strategy to protect us against other threats we were too young and too easily overwhelmed to answer.\n\nThe manic worrier worries, as it were, about \u2018everything\u2019 because they are unable to be appropriately concerned with, and in mourning for, one or two big things from long ago. The anxiety that belonged to one particular distant time and place has been redistributed and subdivided across hundreds of ever shifting topics in the present (from workplace to reputation, money to household tasks), because its true source and origins remain unknown to the sufferer.\n\nWe are using the flotsam and jetsam of everyday worries as a proxy for an unmasterable trauma: shame; humiliation; a sense that we don\u2019t matter to our caregivers; neglect or abuse. We should not sarcastically point out to worriers that they need \u2018something else to worry about\u2019, we should realise that something terrifying that they have buried deep in their unconscious is lending a continuous sense of dread to their fragile present.\n\nWe manic worriers need not sarcasm but supportive and intelligent company to give us the love we need to dare to look back at the past \u2013 and the insight with which to try to do so. Our dread is a symptom of an ancient sorrow, a sign that we keep not finding anything in the outer world that answers to the horror of the inner one.\n\nNeedless to say, it isn\u2019t the case that there is never anything to worry about in the present, just that there is a lot less than the manic worrier tends to believe. Furthermore, what there is to worry about can be coped with with far more resilience than the manic worrier can imagine, for they are operating with what is essentially a child\u2019s sense of their own powers and capacity for survival. Manic worriers should gradually come to exchange their feelings of dread for the future for a patient understanding and mourning for an unfairly traumatic and as yet insufficiently explored past.\n\nThere is nothing greedy or stupid about happiness. The ability to take appropriate satisfaction from the good times is a profound psychological achievement: it is a mark of deep seriousness to be able to giggle, have a pillow fight with a child, delight in a fig, sunbathe, sometimes knock off work early to have an ice cream and appreciate a daffodil. Sorrow is obvious; there is always a richness of reasons to despair. Fear is safe as well; if we are waiting for the enemy with sword in hand, we may gain a vital few seconds were the blow to come. But the truly courageous and heroically defiant move (given our background) would be to dare to put down our weapon, lessen our preparations for catastrophe, resist the terrors ingrained in us over decades and once in a while believe that, astonishingly, for a time, there might truly be nothing to worry about.",

      "content": "### AN IDEAL LIFE FOR THE ANXIOUS\n\nHowever much we often claim that we would like not to be so anxious, we seldom systematically undertake truly concerted efforts not to be. Our moves, in so far as we make them, tend to be modest and intermittent: a book here or there, the odd candle, a trip to the countryside, a New Year\u2019s vow to do less and think more. Yet we hold back from fundamentally rearranging our activities in the name of a more serene life. We let our ambitions for calm take a backseat to other, more standard and noisy priorities: making money, raising a family, gaining status.\n\nIt might therefore be revealing, as a thought experiment, to try to imagine what a life might look like in its details if one actually did raise calm to our overwhelming priority; if \u2013 from dawn until bedtime \u2013 all our practical and psychological goals had an untroubled state of mind as their target. Given all that we have learnt about anxiety \u2013 its origins, triggers and salves \u2013 what might some of the features of a pervasively calm life look like?\n\nLiving together\n\nFor a start, we would probably seek to live together, communally, away from the loneliness of a single life or the fractiousness of a nuclear family unit, among a group of people similarly committed to containing anxiety \u2013 but also similarly sensitive to losing their grip on calm. The ideal community would be marked by kindness, gentleness and great sympathy for the troubles of being human. Among such people, there would be no pressure to impress or to deny one\u2019s sorrows and worries. Everyone would be open to the idea that they were a little \u2018broken\u2019 \u2013 while simultaneously profoundly committed to the business of repair and generosity.\n\nA building\n\nChristian monks understood early on that living as part of a community governed by an ideal would require a particular kind of architectural setting and location. The monasteries that sprang up around Europe in the Dark Ages enforced their spiritual commitments with very specific architectural features: massive stone walls, bare but noble furnishings, inner courtyards, communal dining tables, kitchen gardens and simple \u2013 though often elegant \u2013 cells equipped with a bed, a desk and a narrow view out onto open country. The monasteries were typically situated far from cities, so that their members could concentrate on their studies and thoughts, while regularly drawing inspiration from the sublimity of nature.\n\nThere are obvious differences between a life devoted to God and one devoted to calm, but we can imagine being no less purposeful in the design of a community for serenity. An ideal such community might, for example, be situated in one of the more remote Canary Islands (El Hierro or La Gomera), so that members could enjoy a constantly mild, light and agreeable climate, a fresh, light vegetable-based diet, groves of almond, lemon and mango trees and, at night, reminders of humanity\u2019s redemptively small place in the wider scheme derived from the exceptionally clear, pollution-free views onto the cosmos above.\n\nThere would, we can imagine, be dispersed bedrooms around the property, a large dining room, a library, space for meetings \u2013 and colonnades around which to walk and share pieces of one\u2019s inner life.\n\nGatherings\n\nEvery day in this ideal architectural setting, one would gather in a group and share whatever was in danger of engulfing or troubling one: there might be a discussion on shame or childhood neglect, anger or passivity. The purpose of such group discussions would be to foster a mood of communal introspection and strengthen every individual\u2019s commitment to understanding and soothing themselves. Any feeling that one was an outcast would regularly be diminished by the spirit of honest confession and candid interaction.\n\nTime for reflection\n\nA lot of the time, in the Community for the Anxious, one would be free of commitments and able to sit on one\u2019s own, downloading the contents of one\u2019s mind, while sitting in an elegantly appointed but very simple room (perhaps with a glimpse of a fig tree outside). One would work through outstanding anxieties, run through historic hurts and analyse where one\u2019s life might go next.\n\nConcept drawings, a School of Life Community for Serenity\n\nPsychotherapy\n\nAs a substitute for the religious instruction of monasteries, there would \u2013 in the Community for the Anxious \u2013 be a full complement of the best psychotherapists. Once a day, one would be able to sit with someone expertly trained to listen to, and make sense of, the confusions of one\u2019s mind. To the sound of a trickling fountain outside, the therapist would tease out one\u2019s more reticent and defensive aspects, help one feel compassionate towards one\u2019s younger self, untangle dreams and fears \u2013 and teach one how to trust anew and communicate maturely with other people.\n\nRoutines\n\nLife in the Community would, in the best sense, be very boring. There would be no newspapers or screens. What was happening beyond the island would be a matter of deep indifference (except in so far as it had urgent relevance). Every day would be much like any other. One wouldn\u2019t be trying to do anything very complicated. An achievement might be to help to rake the courtyard or rearrange some books in the library. The therapeutic value of cooking, housekeeping and gardening would be fully recognised \u2013 and rather than being seen as demeaning tasks, these would be framed as calming and essential. \u2018I\u2019ve been so busy\u2019 would be one of the most shocking things one could say to others. All the glamour would centre around being able to reveal that one had done not very much at all other than think, talk and rest.\n\nNo status race\n\nBecause one would be among sincere friends, there would be no attempts to jockey for position or assert one\u2019s superiority. Being famous or rich would lose any meaning because the only currencies in operation would be those of sincerity and kindness.\n\nGood habits\n\nThe Community would recognise that the great enemy of a good life is that we have the wrong habits. It isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t know in theory what would help us; we simply have no mechanism for instilling the right behaviours in practice. So the Community would impose a deliberately rather bossy set of routines, not in order to trap us, but in order to liberate us to be the calm people we anyway long to be. The diary for the day might look like this:\n\nIt would \u2013 of course \u2013 be very hard for us to live like this, but this deliberately somewhat dramatic proposal at least gives us a sense of what we might need to do if we are sincere in our aspirations to lead calmer lives. Given that an unagitated state truly is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding of modalities, we might dare to make a few major moves. We are anxious not only out of our innate biological dispositions (though these don\u2019t help), but chiefly because we don\u2019t structure our lives properly so as to counteract our panicky natures. And given that we rarely obtain what we don\u2019t plan for, we are about as worried as we can be expected to be \u2013 in the conditions we have built for ourselves.\n\nFor too much of our own lives, and for too long in the course of human history, we have left calm to chance. We owe it to ourselves to start more consciously to build the calm lives we so deeply crave and could so richly benefit from.\n\nThe School of Life is a global organisation helping people lead more fulfilled lives. It is a resource for helping us understand ourselves, for improving our relationships, our careers and our social lives \u2013 as well as for helping us find calm and get more out of our leisure hours. We do this through films, workshops, books, gifts and community. You can find us online, in stores and in welcoming spaces around the globe.",

      "content": "## I : Challenge\n\nFor a long time, we may cope well enough. We make it to work every morning, we give pleasant summaries of our lives to friends, we smile over dinner. We aren\u2019t totally balanced, but there\u2019s no good way of knowing how difficult things might be for other people, and what we might have a right to expect in terms of contentment and peace of mind. We probably tell ourselves to stop being self-indulgent and redouble our efforts to feel worthy through achievement. We are probably world experts in not feeling sorry for ourselves.\n\nDecades may pass. It\u2019s not uncommon for the most serious mental conditions to remain undiagnosed for half a lifetime. We simply don\u2019t notice that we are, beneath the surface, chronically anxious, filled with self-loathing, and close to overwhelming despair and rage. This too simply ends up feeling normal.\n\nUntil one day, finally, something triggers a collapse. It might be a crisis at work, a reversal in our career plans or a mistake we\u2019ve made over a task. It might be a romantic failure, someone leaving us, or a realization that we are profoundly unhappy with a partner we had thought would be our long-term future. Alternatively, we feel mysteriously exhausted and sad, to the extent that we can\u2019t face anything any more, even a family meal or a conversation with a friend. Or we are struck by unmanageable anxiety around everyday challenges, like addressing our colleagues or going into a store. We\u2019re swamped by a sense of doom and imminent catastrophe. We sob uncontrollably.\n\nWe are in a mental crisis.\n\nThis is what might come next . . .\n\n1 Breakdown\n\nIf we are lucky, when it feels impossible to carry on any longer we will know to put up the white flag at once. There is nothing shameful or rare in our condition; we have fallen ill, as so many before us have. We need not compound our sickness with a sense of embarrassment. This is what happens when you are a delicate human facing the hurtful, alarming and always uncertain conditions of existence. Recovery can start the moment we admit we no longer have a clue how to cope.\n\nThe roots of the crisis almost certainly go back a long way. Things will have not been right in certain areas for an age, possibly for ever. There will have been grave inadequacies in the early days, things that were said and done to us that should never have been, and bits of reassurance and care that were ominously missed out. In addition to this, adult life will have layered on difficulties which we were not well equipped to know how to endure. It will have applied pressure along our most tender, invisible fault lines.\n\nOur illness is trying to draw attention to our problems, but it can only do so inarticulately, by throwing up coarse and vague symptoms. It knows how to signal that we are worried and sad, but it can\u2019t tell us what about and why. That will be the work of patient investigation, over months and years, probably in the company of experts. The illness contains the cure, but it has to be teased out and its original inarticulacy interpreted. Something from the past is crying out to be recognized and will not leave us alone until we have given it its due.\n\nIt may seem\u2014at points\u2014like death sentence but we are, beneath the crisis, being given an opportunity to restart our lives on a more generous, kind, and realistic footing. There is an art to being ill\u2014and to daring at last to listen to what our pain is trying to tell us.\n\nMental health is a miracle we are apt not to notice until the moment it slips from our grasp\u2014at which point we may wonder how we ever managed to do anything as complicated and beautiful as order our thoughts sanely and calmly.\n\nA mind in a healthy state is, in the background, continually performing a near-miraculous set of maneuvers that underpin our moods of clear-sightedness and purpose. To appreciate what mental health involves\u2014and therefore what makes up its opposite\u2014we should take a moment to consider some of what will be happening in the folds of an optimally functioning mind:\n\nFirst and foremost, a healthy mind is an editing mind, an organ that manages to sieve, from thousands of stray, dramatic, disconcerting, or horrifying thoughts, those particular ideas and sensations that actively need to be entertained in order for us to direct our lives effectively.\n\nPartly this means keeping at bay punitive and critical judgments that might want to tell us repeatedly how disgraceful and appalling we are\u2014long after harshness has ceased to serve any useful purpose. When we are interviewing for a new job or taking someone on a date, a healthy mind doesn\u2019t force us to listen to inner voices that insist on our unworthiness. It allows us to talk to ourselves as we would to a friend.\n\nAt the same time, a healthy mind resists the pull of unfair comparisons. It doesn\u2019t constantly allow the achievements and successes of others to throw us off course and reduce us to a state of bitter inadequacy. It doesn\u2019t torture us by continually comparing our condition to that of people who have, in reality, had very different upbringings and trajectories through life. A well-functioning mind recognizes the futility and cruelty of constantly finding fault with its own nature.\n\nAlong the way, a healthy mind keeps a judicious grip on the drip, drip, drip of fear. It knows that, in theory, there is an endless number of things that we could worry about: A blood vessel might fail, a scandal might erupt, the plane\u2019s engines could sheer from its wings . . . But it has a good sense of the distinction between what could conceivably happen and what is in fact likely to happen, and so it is able to leave us in peace as regards the wilder eventualities of fate, confident that awful things will either not unfold or could be dealt with ably enough if ever they did so. A healthy mind avoids catastrophic imaginings: It knows that there are broad and stable stone steps, not a steep and slippery incline, between itself and disaster.\n\nA healthy mind has compartments with heavy doors that shut securely. It can compartmentalize where it needs to. Not all thoughts belong at all moments. While talking to a grandmother, the mind prevents the emergence of images of last night\u2019s erotic fantasies; while looking after a child, it can repress its more cynical and misanthropic analyses. Aberrant thoughts about jumping on a train line or harming yourself with a sharp knife can remain brief peculiar flashes rather than repetitive fixations. A healthy mind has mastered the techniques of censorship.\n\nA healthy mind can quieten its own buzzing preoccupations in order, at times, to focus on the world beyond itself. It can be present and engaged with what and who is immediately around. Not everything it could feel has to be felt at every moment.\n\nA healthy mind combines an appropriate suspicion of certain people with a fundamental trust in humanity. It can take an intelligent risk with a stranger. It doesn\u2019t extrapolate from life\u2019s worst moments in order to destroy the possibility of connection.\n\nA healthy mind knows how to hope; it identifies and then hangs on tenaciously to a few reasons to keep going. Grounds for despair, anger, and sadness are, of course, all around. But the healthy mind knows how to bracket negativity in the name of endurance. It clings to evidence of what is still good and kind. It remembers to appreciate; it can\u2014despite everything\u2014still look forward to a hot bath, some dried fruit or dark chocolate, a chat with a friend, or a satisfying day of work. It refuses to let itself be silenced by all the many sensible arguments in favor of rage and despondency.\n\nOutlining some of the features of a healthy mind helps us to identify what can go awry when we fall ill. At the heart of mental illness is a loss of control over our own better thoughts and feelings. An unwell mind can\u2019t apply a filter to the information that reaches our awareness; it can no longer order or sequence its content. And from this, any number of painful scenarios ensue:\n\nIdeas keep coming to the fore that serve no purpose, unkind voices echo ceaselessly. Worrying possibilities press on us all at once, without any bearing on the probability of their occurrence. Fear runs riot.\n\nSimultaneously, regrets drown out any capacity to make our peace with who we are. Every bad thing we have ever said or done reverberates and cripples our self-esteem. We are unable to assign correct proportions to anything: A drawer that doesn\u2019t open feels like a conclusive sign that we are doomed; a slightly unfriendly remark by an acquaintance becomes proof that we shouldn\u2019t exist. We can\u2019t grade our worries and focus in on the few that might truly deserve concern.\n\nWe can\u2019t temper our sadness. We can\u2019t overcome the idea that we have not been loved properly, that we have made a mess of the whole of our working lives, that we have disappointed everyone who ever had a shred of faith in us.\n\nEvery compartment of the mind is blown open. The strangest, most extreme thoughts run unchecked across consciousness. We begin to fear that we might shout obscenities in public or do harm with the kitchen knives.\n\nIn the worst cases, we lose the power to distinguish outer reality from our inner world. We can\u2019t tell what is outside us and what inside, where we end and others begin; we speak to people as if they were actors in our own dreams.\n\nAt night, such is the maelstrom and the ensuing exhaustion that we become defenseless before our worst apprehensions. By 3 a.m., after hours of rumination, doing away with ourselves no longer feels like such a remote or unwelcome notion.\n\nHowever dreadful this sounds, it is a paradox that, for the most part, mental illness doesn\u2019t tend to look from the outside as dramatic as we think it should. The majority of us, when we are mentally unwell, will not be foaming at the mouth or insisting that we are Napoleon. We won\u2019t be making speeches about alien invasions or declaring that we control space and time. Our suffering will be quieter, more inward, more concealed, and more contiguous with societal norms; we\u2019ll sob mutely into the pillow or dig our nails silently into our palms. Others may not even realize for a very long time, if ever, that we are in difficulty. We ourselves may not quite accept the scale of our sickness.\n\nThe clich\u00e9d images of \u201cmadness\u201d\u2014with their obscenities, ravings, and bombast\u2014may be frightening in themselves, but our collective focus on them suggests a concealed search for reassurance. We depict mental illness in colorful and extreme terms to convince ourselves of our own sanity; to put some clear blue water between our own fragile states and those of people we dismissively term \u201clunatics.\u201d We thereby fail to acknowledge the extent to which mental illness is ultimately as common, and as essentially unshameful, as its bodily counterpart\u2014and also comprises a host of more minor ailments, the equivalents of cold sores and broken wrists, abdominal cramps or ingrowing toenails.\n\nWhen we define mental illness as a loss of command over the mind, few of us can claim to be free of all instances of unwellness. True mental health involves a frank acceptance of how much ill health there will have to be in even the most ostensibly competent and meaningful lives. There will be days when we simply can\u2019t stop crying over someone we have lost. Or when we worry so much about the future that we wish we hadn\u2019t been born. Or when we feel so sad that it seems futile even to open our mouths. We should at such times be counted as no less ill than a person laid up in bed with flu\u2014and as worthy of attention and sympathy.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that we are at least a hundred years away from properly fathoming how the brain operates\u2014and how it might be healed. We are in the mental arena roughly equivalent to where we might have been in bodily medicine around the middle of the seventeenth century, as we slowly built up a picture of how blood circulated around our veins or our kidneys functioned. In our attempts to find fixes, we are akin to those surgeons depicted in early prints who cut up cadavers with rusty scissors and clumsily dug around the innards with a poker. We will\u2014surprisingly\u2014be well on the way to colonizing Mars before we definitively grasp the secrets to the workings of our own minds.\n\nIt is surely no coincidence that in many parts of Europe, asylums for the mentally ill were, from the Renaissance onward, opened up in converted monasteries, signaling an implicit connection between the solace sought from religion and from psychiatry. The best of these asylums, and there were very few, promised a dignified refuge from the pressures of society and the terrors of the mind. They may have had extensive gardens, most famously like the one at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my, where an ailing Vincent Van Gogh spent a year in 1889, sitting very still in his room for hours at a time and then painting dozens of sublime canvases of irises, cypresses, and pine trees, paintings that may to this day help persuade the inconsolable to keep living.\n\nVincent Van Gogh, The Garden of the Asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my, May 1889, 1889.\n\nIn its way, this book aims to be a sanctuary, a walled garden filled with nourishing psychological vegetation and with comfortable benches on which to sit and recover our strength, in an atmosphere of kindness and fellow feeling. It outlines a raft of therapeutic moves with which we might approach our most stubborn mental afflictions and instabilities. It sets out to be a friend through some of the most difficult moments of our lives.",

      "content": "## A SELF-PORTRAIT\n\nOur societies sometimes struggle with the question of what art might be for. Here the answer feels simple: Art is a weapon against despair. It is a tool with which to alleviate a sense of crushing isolation and uniqueness. It provides common ground where the sadness in me can, with dignity and intelligence, meet the sadness in you.\n\nPerhaps for a long time, the man in the diner kept it together. As late as this morning, he might have believed that, despite everything, he would be OK. He\u2019d taken his hat along with him, as always; he remained attached to appearances. Even as his anguish mounted, he kept going, one sip of coffee after another, an occasional pat of the mouth with a paper napkin, while looking out at the busy room: secretaries at lunch, people from the nearby construction site, a few exhausted mothers and their kids. Then, suddenly, there was no more arguing with the despair any longer. It swept him up without any chance of a rejoinder: the mess he had made, the fool he had become in everyone\u2019s eyes, the absurdity of everything. His head hit the table with a shocking clatter but almost at once it was absorbed by the dense murmur of the room and the city. One could die in public here and few would notice.\n\nExcept that there was a French photographer right opposite who was very much into noticing everything: an elegant, willowy man, with a name impossible for Americans to pronounce\u2014he invited them to call him Harry\u2014and a Leica 35 around his neck. Henri Cartier-Bresson had wandered the area all morning; he\u2019d shot a group of women chatting outside on Ground Street and discovered a striking view of midtown Manhattan from the promenade. He had just begun his lunch when, without warning, there came that distinctive bang of a head hitting a table with force.\n\nWe need not feel ashamed, the photograph suggests, that we are in despair; it is an inevitable part of being alive. The distress that normally dwells painfully and privately inside our minds has been given social expression\u2014and no longer needs to be shouldered alone. Whatever a distressingly upbeat world sometimes implies, it is normal, very normal, to be in agony. We don\u2019t, on top of it all, ever need to feel unique for being unwell.\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson, A Caf\u00e9, 2nd Avenue, Brooklyn, NYC, USA, 1947.",

      "content": "## CURLING UP INTO A BALL\n\nWe cause ourselves a lot of pain by pretending to be competent, all-knowing, proficient adults long after we should, ideally, have called for help. We suffer a bitter rejection in love, but tell ourselves and our acquaintances that we never cared. We hear some wounding rumors about us but refuse to stoop to our opponents\u2019 level. We find we can\u2019t sleep at night and are exhausted and anxious in the day, but continue to insist that stepping aside for a break is only for weaklings.\n\nWe all originally came from a very tight ball-like space. For the first nine months of our existence, we were curled up, with our head on our knees, protected from a more dangerous and colder world beyond by the position of our limbs. In our young years, we knew well enough how to recover this ball position when things got tough. If we were mocked in the playground or misunderstood by a snappy parent, it was instinctive to go up to our room and adopt the ball position until matters started to feel more manageable again. Only later, around adolescence, did some of us lose sight of this valuable exercise in regression and thereby began missing out on a chance for nurture and recovery.\n\nWe have all come from a ball position but only some of us remember to return there on a regular basis: Leonardo da Vinci, Studies of the Foetus in the Womb, c. 1510\u201313.\n\nDominant ideas of what can be expected of a wise, fully mature adult tend to lack realism. Though we may be twenty-eight or forty-seven on the outside, we are inevitably still carrying within us a child for whom a day at work will be untenably exhausting, a child who won\u2019t be able to calm down easily after an insult, who will need reassurance after every minor rejection, who will want to cry without quite knowing why and who will fairly regularly require a chance to be \u201cheld\u201d until the sobs have subsided.\n\nIt is a sign of the supreme wisdom of small children that they have no shame or compunction about bursting into tears. They have a more accurate and less pride-filled sense of their place in the world than a typical adult: They know that they are only extremely small beings in a hostile and unpredictable realm, that they can\u2019t control much of what is happening around them, that their powers of understanding are limited, and that there is a great deal to feel distressed, melancholy, and confused about.\n\nAs we age, we learn to avoid being, at all costs, that most apparently repugnant\u2014and yet in fact deeply philosophical\u2014of creatures: the crybaby. But moments of losing courage belong to a brave life. If we do not allow ourselves frequent occasions to bend, we will be at far greater risk of one day fatefully snapping.\n\nWhen the impulse to cry strikes, we should be grown up enough to cede to it as we did in our fourth or fifth years. We should repair to a quiet room, put the duvet over our head, and allow despondency to have its way. There is in truth no maturity without an adequate negotiation with the infantile and no such thing as a proper grown-up who does not frequently yearn to be comforted like a toddler.\n\nIf we have properly sobbed, at some point in the misery an idea\u2014however minor\u2014will at last enter our mind and make a tentative case for the other side: We\u2019ll remember that it would be quite pleasant and possible to have a very hot bath, that someone once stroked our hair kindly, that we have one and a half good friends on the planet and an interesting book still to read\u2014and we\u2019ll know that the worst of the storm may be ebbing.",

      "content": "## THE SLEEP OF REASON PRODUCES MONSTERS\n\nGoya\u2019s title is central. In case we were to miss it, it is even etched on the desk, and it sounds more eloquent still in the original: El sue\u00f1o de la raz\u00f3n produce monstruos. As the artist knew intimately\u2014he\u2019d been manic depressive since late adolescence\u2014night is when things can become properly unbearable if our mind is fragile.\n\nEach of Goya\u2019s monstrous animals is really a thought of the kind that can assail us when we are exhausted. Such thoughts are an internalization of the most awful messages we\u2019ve ever heard from other people\u2014probably those we grew up around: You are no good. You disgust me. Don\u2019t you dare to outsmart me. The owl with outstretched wings might be shrieking: You will never achieve anything. The furry-beaked bat might be hissing: Your desires are revolting. The lynx-like thing at the bottom looks on judgmentally: I\u2019m so disappointed in what you\u2019ve become.\n\nDuring the day, when we feel so-called monsters hovering as we talk to a colleague or have dinner with friends, we can fend the animals off with rational arguments: Of course we\u2019ve done nothing wrong. There\u2019s no reason to keep apologizing. We have the right to be. But at night, we can forget all our weapons of self-defense: Why are we still alive? Why haven\u2019t we given up yet? We don\u2019t know what to answer any more.\n\nTo survive mentally, we might need to undertake a lengthy analysis of where each animal comes from, what it feeds off, what makes it go on the prowl and how it can be wrestled into submission. One beast might have been born from our father\u2019s mouth, another from our mother\u2019s neglect. Most of them get excited when we have too much work, when we\u2019re exhausted and when the cities we live in are at their most frenetic. And they hate early nights, nature, and the love of friends.\n\nWe need to manage our monsters\u2014each of us has our own versions\u2014with all the respect we owe to something that has the power to kill us. We need to build very strong cages out of solid, kind arguments against them. At the same time, we can take comfort from the idea that the night-time monsters will get less vicious the more we can lead reasonable, serene lives. With enough gentleness and compassion, we can hope to reach a point when, even in the dead of night, as these monsters chafe at their collars and strike at their bars, we will remember enough about ourselves to be unafraid and to know that we are safe and worthy of tenderness.\n\nGoya\u2019s print isn\u2019t just an evocation of night terrors; it\u2019s also pointing us\u2014more hopefully\u2014to how we might in time tame our monsters through love and reason.\n\nFrancisco Goya, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, plate 43 from \u201cLos Caprichos,\u201d 1799.",

      "content": "## REASONS TO LIVE\n\nWhen we say that someone has fallen mentally ill, what we are frequently indicating is the loss of long-established reasons to remain alive. And so the task ahead is to make a series of interventions, as imaginative as they are kind, that could\u2014somehow\u2014return the unfortunate sufferer to a feeling of the value of their own survival.\n\nThis cannot, of course, ever be a matter of simply telling someone in pain what the answers are or of presenting them with a ready-made checklist of options without any sincere or subtle connections with their own character. If we are to recover a true taste for life, it can only be on the basis that others have been creative and accommodating enough to learn the particularities of our upsets and reversals and are armed with a sufficiently complicated grasp of how resistant our minds can be to the so-called obvious and convenient solutions.\n\nWe can hang on to one essential and cheering thought: that no life, whatever the apparent obstacles, has to be extinguished. There are invariably ways for it to be rendered liveable again; there are always reasons to be found why a person, any person, might go on. What matters is the degree of perseverance, ingenuity, and love we can bring to the task of reinvention and remodelling.\n\nMost probably, the reasons why we will feel we can live will look very different after the crisis compared with what they were before. Like water that has been blocked, our ambitions and enthusiasms will need to seek alternative channels down which to flow. We might not be able to put our confidence in our old social circle or occupation, our partner or our way of thinking. We will have to create new stories about who we are and what counts. We may need to forgive ourselves for errors, give up on a need to feel exceptional, surrender worldly ambitions and cease once and for all to imagine that our minds could be as logical or as reliable as we had hoped.\n\nIf there is any advantage to going through a mental crisis of the worst kind, it is that\u2014on the other side of it\u2014we will have ended up choosing life rather than merely assuming it to be the unremarkable norm. We, the ones who have crawled back from the darkness, may be disadvantaged in a hundred ways, but at least we will have had to find, rather than assumed or inherited, reasons why we are still here. Every day we continue will be a day earned back from death, and our satisfactions will be all the more intense and our gratitude more profound for having been consciously arrived at.\n\n2 Self-Knowledge",

      "content": "## A VISCERAL UNDERSTANDING\n\nOne of the great impediments to understanding our lives properly is our automatic assumption that we already do so. It\u2019s easy to carry around with us, and exchange with others, surface intellectual descriptions of key painful events that leave the marrow of our emotions behind. We may say that we remember, for example, that we \u201cdidn\u2019t get on too well\u201d with our father, that our mother was \u201cslightly neglectful\u201d or that going to boarding school was \u201ca bit sad.\u201d\n\nIt could, on this basis, sound as if we surely have a solid enough grip on events. But these compressed stories are precisely the sort of ready-made, affectless accounts that stand in the way of connecting properly and viscerally with what happened to us and therefore of knowing ourselves adequately. If we can put it in a paradoxical form, our memories are what allows us to forget. Our day-to-day accounts may bear as much resemblance to the vivid truth of our lives as a postcard from Naxos does to a month-long journey around the Aegean.\n\nIf this matters, it\u2019s because only on the basis of proper immersion in past fears, sadnesses, rages, and losses can we ever recover from certain disorders that develop when difficult events have become immobilized within us. To be liberated from the past, we need to mourn it, and for this to occur, we need to get in touch with what it actually felt like. We need to sense, in a way we may not have done for decades, the pain of our sister being preferred to us or the devastation of being maltreated in the study on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe difference between felt and lifeless memories could be compared to the difference between a mediocre and a great painting of spring. Both will show us an identifiable place and time of year, but only a great painter will properly seize, from among millions of possible elements, the few that really render the moment charming, interesting, sad, or tender. In one case we know about spring, in the other we can finally feel it.\n\nThis may seem like a narrow aesthetic consideration, but it goes to the core of what we need to do to recover from many psychological complaints. We cannot continue to fly high over the past in our jet plane while refusing to re-experience the territory we are crossing. We need to land our craft, get out and walk, inch by painful inch, through the swampy realities of long ago. We need to lie down\u2014perhaps on a couch, maybe with music\u2014close our eyes and endure things, metaphorically, on foot. Only when we have returned afresh to our suffering and known it in our bones will it ever promise to leave us alone.\n\nFIGURING OUT WHAT WE REALLY, REALLY THINK\n\nWhat we really think about, for example, the character of a friend, or the next best move we should make in our career or our stance toward an incident in childhood . . . all of our conclusions on such critical topics can remain locked inside us, part of us but inaccessible to ordinary consciousness.\n\nWe operate instead with surface and misleading pictures of our dispositions and goals. We may settle, in haste or fear, on the most obvious answers: our new friend is very kind, we should aim for the most highly paid job, our childhood was \u201cfun.\u201d\n\nWe ignore our truths first and foremost because we aren\u2019t trained to solicit them; no one ever quite tells us that we might need to exhibit the patience and wiliness of an angler while waiting at the riverbank of the deep mind. We\u2019ve been brought up to act fast, to assume that we know everything immediately and to ignore the fact that consciousness is made up of layers, and it\u2019s the lower strata that might contain the richest, most faithful material.\n\nWe may also be hesitant because the answers that emerge from any descent into the depths and subsequent communion with our inner beings can sound at odds with the settled expectations we have of ourselves in daylight. It might turn out that in fact we don\u2019t love who we\u2019re meant to love, or are scared and suspicious of someone who is pressing us to trust them or are deeply moved by, and sympathetic to, a person we hardly know. It\u2019s the profoundly challenging nature of our conclusions that keeps us away from our inner sanctum. We prioritize a sense of feeling normal over the jolting realizations of the true self.\n\nThe steps we need to take in order to check in with ourselves are not especially complicated. We must make time, as often as once a day, to lie very still on our own somewhere, probably in bed or maybe in the bath, to close our eyes and direct our attention toward one of many tangled or murky topics that deserve reflection: a partner, a work challenge, an invitation, a forthcoming trip, a relationship with a child or a parent. We might need a moment to locate our actual concern. Then, disengaged from the ordinary static, we should circle the matter and ask ourselves with unusual guilelessness: What is coming up for me here? Holding the partner, work challenge, invitation, or disagreement patiently in mind, we should whisper to ourselves: What do I really think? What is the real issue? What is truly going on? What is actually at stake?\n\nWe should\u2014to sound a little soft-headed\u2014ask ourselves what our heart is whispering to us or what our gut is trying to articulate. We\u2019re striving to access a sincere part of the mind too often crushed by the barking, harried commands of the conformist executive self.\n\nWhat we will almost certainly find is that, in a quasi-mystical way, the answers are already there waiting for us, like the stars that were present all along and only required the sun to fade in order to come to light in the dome of the sky. We already know\u2014much more accurately than we ever assume\u2014who we should be friends with, what is good and bad for us, and what our purpose on this earth is.\n\nWe need only a few moments in the dark at 11 p.m. or 5 a.m. to wander the corridors of the deep mind with the torch of consciousness and ask: What have I looked at but never seen?",

      "content": "## FACING ANXIETY\n\nOne of the stranger aspects of feeling anxious is that we can be both suffering and markedly uninclined or unable to acknowledge that we are in fact so. We know of course that something isn\u2019t quite right, but a kind of bravery or pride keeps us running forward, unable to square up to the problem. It\u2019s as if, somewhere in our thoughts, we worry that looking at our anxiety directly will bring us harm: slow us down, cause us pain, or just be of no use.\n\nIt helps to note that our minds can easily carry more than one mood. They are like movie theaters with a variety of screens; there tends to be a foreground and a background to our emotional horizon in which very different things may be happening. In the foreground, we might\u2014on a given day\u2014be focused on achieving certain practical goals. Things might be fast-paced and relentless. We might keep opening tabs, scanning the diary, looking up emails\u2014and diverting ourselves with glimpses at the news.\n\nBut then at another level, further back in the emotional sky, there might be something vast, eerie, and confused, a black sun we can\u2019t quite see or touch and yet also can\u2019t escape from. It tracks us everywhere; it is never not present but it doesn\u2019t ever clarify itself into anything with borders. If it had a soundtrack, it might be made up of distant bellowing occult horns. If it were a color, it might be a hazy dark burgundy and brown. If it were made of words, it would be about fear and doom.\n\nIt isn\u2019t, of course, very pleasant to be bearing this sort of diffuse anxiety within us. But we are not powerless before it and the way to defeat it is, paradoxically, to engage with it more directly than we probably have to date. Doing so is both easy and hard. Practically speaking, it requires nothing more than a few questions, questions which sound\u2014at one level\u2014utterly banal in their simplicity. But though such simplicity can be an insult to our pride, we should never do ourselves the injustice of assuming that our misery rests on something overly complex at a procedural level. We are sometimes like a high-powered aeroplane that can be grounded because a small screw is missing. We should be humble in the face of the ostensibly simple things that can ruin our lives.\n\nWith this caveat, we should step outside the ordinary flow of the anxious day for a moment, close our eyes, take a deep breath and ask ourselves this: What am I really worried about right now?\n\nIf we let the question resonate for a time, allowing its true profundity to emerge, we stand to find that, waiting until we have quietened the noise, there is a pain we knew all along, looking up at us with startled, wise eyes, like those of a tortoise we find hiding beneath a car or a fox burrowed in a corner of the garden.\n\nWe can continue the questioning: Why is this thing so worrying?\n\nAnd then: What could I tell myself to make this less bad?\n\nAnd finally, we can ask ourselves to complete a sentence: I feel compassion for myself because . . .\n\nIt sounds so simple and it takes only a few minutes, but it can decisively change the internal weather. Our minds are not obvious to themselves. We may be running for days, months, decades even, without pausing to wonder what is really the matter. We have so much misplaced composure, it can be dreadful to realize how fragile and scared we have been all along. We need to create a small safe place in which we can ask ourselves some basic questions\u2014and whisper to ourselves what we are truly finding difficult.\n\n3 Childhood",

      "content": "## THIS FEELS LIKE AN INSULT\n\nModern psychotherapy is united on one point: Our problems require us to engage with our childhoods. This can feel profoundly offensive. How insulting to be told that childhood could matter inordinately to our adult lives, to our temperament, our chances of happiness, our sexuality, our levels of anxiety, and our self-esteem. Particularly if our childhood was difficult, we want more than anything to escape its dark centrifugal energy and to imagine ourselves as a free agent, able to determine the future without impediment. How dispiriting to be asked to believe that who we are was substantially determined by external factors before we reached the age of reason and, moreover, that if we are to have any hope of helping ourselves, we must undertake a painful and lengthy journey to understand the past in fine-grained detail.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why we might want to take out our annoyance on psychotherapy itself. Has this discipline not seen how broad and interesting the world is? How many grand and strange things there are in it? Hasn\u2019t it soared over the Western Australian desert or wandered the stately corridors of palaces and national libraries? Why does it so badly want us to return to, and circle, the messy claustrophobic start?\n\nWe understand. To take on the past, we don\u2019t need to be driven by a preternatural enthusiasm for self-exploration, we don\u2019t need to be self-pitying or dementedly furious with parents who were only trying to do their best. All that is required is a weary, dutiful realization that the principal way to overcome our history is to address it. We should try to remember not out of nostalgia, but in order to be able to forget, once and for all.\n\nCOULD IT MATTER SO MUCH?\n\nOur unwillingness to look backward might have to do with more than just boredom or frustration; it might be a symptom of sheer incredulity that childhood could matter as much as it apparently does. Could this period be so critical? Could events in those short years have such an outsize influence on everything that comes after? Are children really so impressionable and so easily marked?\n\nThe short answer to all such enquiries is a weary, regretful but resounding yes. The human mind between the ages of one and ten is dauntingly receptive, infinitely attuned to its environment, which means that our whole identity can be decisively and near-permanently shaped by our young experiences. A somewhat cold, forbidding father or an erratic mother really may be all that is required to breed an elevated degree of anxiety or self-hatred that colors the next eight decades. This susceptibility has been present throughout history, but only now are we beginning to notice it and give it due attention. Every era had its share of childhood-damaged people, it\u2019s just that no one bothered to find out why the fishmonger was so sad, the merchant fell into rages, or the knight was impotent\u2014just as no one bothered to investigate what might pollute water or how germs could spread. We are, finally, becoming a little more aware of causes and effects.\n\nIn insisting on the importance of the early years, it can help to think of the acquisition of language. Without having any memory of the phenomenon, all of us learned\u2014between the ages of zero and five\u2014many thousands of words and their seemingly limitless combinations. While we were innocently going about our business\u2014doing cartwheels in the yard, drawing submarines at the kitchen table, eating cookies by the TV\u2014a part of our minds was picking up and assembling, with extraordinary ingenuity, entire dictionaries of terminologies, declensions, verb endings, gerunds, and subordinate clauses. Without having any clue how it all happened, we became expert grammarians, far surpassing our mightiest computers in dexterity.\n\nWe should imagine that something similar was going on in the psychological sphere. We were acquiring an extensive command of emotional language: We were learning about trust, communication, esteem, kindness, cruelty, shame, anger, empathy, selfishness, and responsibility. And we didn\u2019t realize that this was happening any more than we realized that we were learning to speak. We were simply going about the ordinary business of childhood while being emotionally imprinted in a most permanent and comprehensive way by the people around us.\n\nWe now spare little time thinking of how relative our emotional language might be, just as we seldom reflect on the arbitrariness of speaking English or French rather than Sentinelese or Pirah\u00e3. We overlook that there are people for whom love is mohabbat (Hindi) or who bid each other goodnight with hyv\u00e4\u00e4 y\u00f6t\u00e4 (Finnish) or w\u01cen\u2019\u0101n (Cantonese). Or, to shift register, people who don\u2019t feel depressed every time they succeed or worry that any sexual encounter might end in shame.\n\nAnd finally, as with standard language, with time we stand to realize how appallingly hard it can be to learn a new and different language, what a struggle we have ahead of us when we no longer want to speak in our allocated tongue\u2014a tongue of anxiety, self-hatred, contempt, or cynicism\u2014and seek to try to express ourselves instead in tones of trust, calm, and kindness.",

Notice, first, their scale. The fingers are implausibly tiny, the wrists even more so. A modest bump to the head or three centimeters of water can finish them off. Notice, too, how out of control they are. Saliva dribbles from their mouth, their head bobs drunkenly when they are weary, they fall asleep in supermarkets or on the laps of near strangers. They\u2019re wholly, terrifyingly trusting. They lack all defenses. They take everything at face value. They\u2019ll follow you wherever you want to take them. You can tell them strange stories about who lives in the house next door, or why the trees look the way they do, or what sort of a human being you are. And they\u2019ll agree. They have no place from which to judge anything independently. They can\u2019t tell if Mommy is as nice as she claims, they simply know that she has supernatural powers and understands how to drive a car and make lumps of dough morph into cakes in the oven. They won\u2019t be able to determine whether what Daddy is doing is reasonable or kind until another decade has passed.\n\nThe vulnerability is both touching and\u2014when you remember how damaged certain adults are\u2014appalling. You can do anything with little people. Tell them you are their friend and then burn their hand, give them a lollipop and then separate them from their parents, whisper to them late at night that no one must ever know about this and ruin them for life. It sounds highly disturbing and it is.\n\nWe were those little people once. We aren\u2019t any longer. We know the ways of the world. We\u2019re tall and our voices carry. We can think freely. But this was once us\u2014and the distortions of those years have a habit of remaining embedded within our minds for a long time, beneath a substratum of maturity. We owe it to ourselves to take a very patient look at what might have happened to us before we knew who we were.\n\nWHAT IS A GOOD PARENT?\n\nWe can afford a few generalizations. First, and most importantly, a competent parent is someone who can feel inordinately pleased that their child has come into the world\u2014and never ceases to remind themselves or their offspring of the fact, in direct and indirect ways, at small and large moments, pretty much every day. There is no risk of spoiling anyone by doing so: Spoilt people are those who were denied love, not those who had their fill of it.\n\nSecond, the good parent is attuned to their child; they listen\u2014very closely indeed\u2014to what the small person is trying to say. This means getting down on their knees and paying attention to messages that may sometimes sound extremely weird. Maybe the child is saying that they are very sad, even though it\u2019s their birthday and the parent has gone to enormous trouble with the presents. Maybe they are saying that they are angry with their teacher, even if education is in principle very important and the school was difficult to get into. Maybe they are explaining that they are fed up with Granny, though of course she means well and she\u2019s our mother too. Children are filled with complicated emotions that may have no place in the average adult\u2019s assessment of what is \u201cnormal,\u201d let alone convenient. Good parents suspend judgment and check their certainties. There is no danger of creating an entitled brat by doing so. People who cause a fuss don\u2019t generally do so because they have been listened to a lot; they start screaming\u2014and later taking drugs and robbing stores\u2014because their smaller, younger messages were never heard.\n\nA good parent is, furthermore, not so fragile that they constantly need to be obeyed. They can take being sometimes called a fool because they lost their pride long ago. They\u2019re sufficiently on top of the unfairness of life not to mind being someone on whom a child, especially a teenage one, occasionally offloads their disappointments at the misery of everything. They don\u2019t need to instil terror; they have the self-confidence to be ignored or overlooked brusquely when a child\u2019s development requires it.\n\nA good parent isn\u2019t envious of their children. They are strong enough to allow them to have a better life than they did. They aren\u2019t sadists: They never derive relief from making a child miserable. They don\u2019t feel any cleverer themselves by telling the child that they\u2019re an idiot, or more in control by monitoring the child\u2019s every move.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to pass on their sadness and regret. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to make someone very unhappy because someone else made them miserable long ago.\n\nThey are sufficiently on top of their issues to be able to warn their children about them. They make it easy for the child to work out what the family madness is\u2014and to move on from it. They don\u2019t insist on their normality and then challenge the child to determine where they\u2019ve been lied to.\n\nThey don\u2019t inject their poison into anyone: Their jealousy, terror, ambition, or disappointment remains a matter for them alone.\n\nThey don\u2019t need attention from their own children because they have enough of an audience elsewhere.\n\nThey don\u2019t demand admiration\u2014and certainly not gratitude. They know how to be calm and even boring. They absorb the child\u2019s excitements and terrors without adding to them. They show up day after day and act with reliable dullness. Of course they have drama going on beneath the surface, it\u2019s just that no child wants to think of their parent as overly complicated or three-dimensional. The good parent doesn\u2019t mind being, in a benign sense, a caricature.\n\nThe good parent knows how to play because their imagination is free: the doll can be a princess, the couch can be a ship and dinner might be pushed back by half an hour without peril. They\u2019re solid enough inside not to need to impose rigidity on the world. Sometimes, they can allow themselves to be very silly.\n\nThey know about boundaries. The game was hilarious for a long time, but now it\u2019s the moment to wind down, to put the paints away, to get back to work or to go up to bed. The good parent doesn\u2019t mind being hated for a time in the name of honoring reality.\n\nAround the good parent, the child is, at the same time, allowed to utter \u201cno\u201d about certain matters, being a center of sufficient autonomy to disagree. It should not have the final say but should invariably have a voice.\n\nThe good parent is tender: Of course teddy\u2019s lost eye doesn\u2019t matter in the broad run of things, but the child\u2019s world is small and minor things loom large in it. Good parents therefore have the patience to respond to the child\u2019s minor crises and delights from a sure sense that maturity will emerge through precisely targeted indulgence.\n\nWe might think back to our past and give our carers a score to measure how things went. It isn\u2019t unfair or mean sometimes\u2014in the privacy of our own minds\u2014to hold people to account.",

      "content": "## THE PARENTS WHO LIVE INSIDE OUR MINDS\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of how invisible the process of parental imprinting can be that most of us would be highly surprised to think that a parent or two might be living inside our heads. The way we think seems to us to be the result of our own will. We seldom come across any voices or attitudes that feel actively foreign or externally sourced.\n\nNevertheless, given how long we were exposed to them and at what formative stages, our parents may have left more of a mark on us than we normally recognize and may be constantly commenting on our lives from inside like a chorus of unhelpful marionettes.\n\nWhen we fail, a voice inside us may say: You should never get above your station. When a relationship breaks down, an inner voice might whisper: Never expect anything from others. When a nasty rumor spreads about us, we hear: You were always too impulsive.\n\nIt can help to ask ourselves a number of questions about our parents\u2019 views\u2014as experience has taught us to conceive of them. We might, without thinking too hard and thereby allowing our defenses to choke our spontaneous insights, finish the following sentences:\n\nMy father gave me a feeling that I am . . .\n\nMy mother left me with a sense that I am . . .\n\nMy father would now think that I am . . .\n\nMy mother would now think that I am . . .\n\nWhat our inner parents have to say is often not especially enlightened or in line with what we want for ourselves. And yet even so we can observe how deeply such ideas sink into us.\n\nWe can continue the exercise:\n\nIf I really needed him, my father . . .\n\nIf I really needed her, my mother . . .\n\nTo disagree with my father would mean . . .\n\nTo disagree with my mother would mean . . .\n\nIf I made a mistake, my father would . . .\n\nIf I made a mistake, my mother would . . .\n\nOur parents\u2019 views rarely stick out in our minds. Instead, they merge with our own; they lose their identifying labels and become sides of everyday consciousness, indistinguishable from what we more broadly want and believe.\n\nYet we should try to reverse the process of absorption and recover some distance between ourselves and impulses and attitudes that may bear no relation to our healthier aspirations. It\u2019s bad enough to suffer; it\u2019s even worse to do so at the hands of what we might as well term, with no supernatural associations, a coven of unfriendly ghosts.",

      "content": "## THE EXTREME LOYALTY OF CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS\n\nWe hear a lot about ungrateful children: offspring who lack respect and deference, who don\u2019t appreciate how much was done for them, who complain without reason and lament with unfair bitterness.\n\nBut what is often missed is how deeply children are, for the most part, loyal to their parents. They will go to enormous lengths to try to think well of those who brought them into the world, isolating things that are good in them and focusing on these wholeheartedly at the expense of memorizing what was mean-spirited or painful.\n\nAs psychotherapists have long observed, the worse the childhood, the greater and more manic the filial loyalty tends to be. There are no more tenacious defenders of their parents\u2019 legacies and reputations than those who were maligned, ignored, or physically harmed. In a choice between thinking that we might be bad ourselves or accepting that a parent was the disappointing and cruel one, self-hatred tends to win most of the time. It is, in the end, less devastating to deem ourselves ungrateful and awful than to imagine that we were brought up by small-minded mediocrities who were too ill or troubled to care.\n\nARE WE MODERNS UNIQUELY SELF-OBSESSED?\n\nTo compound our sense of irritation at needing to look at our childhoods, we may have a nagging sense that doing so is a uniquely modern luxury. It can seem like evidence of a particularly regrettable kind of decadence and weakness that we should be spending so much time thinking of \u201cMommy\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u201d while outside bigger and more important issues await us. We may enviously suspect that earlier, less cosseted and more martial ages had no time for any such nonsense. They were too busy surviving to indulge themselves in idle, circuitous thoughts about their ancestors and progenitors.\n\nBut we should be wary on this score. People in other ages may not have had the language of Freud; they didn\u2019t know about projection, the superego, or repression. And yet they thought a lot about mommies and daddies nonetheless\u2014and worried intensely about the impact they had on their lives. Even while they were spearing enemies, tracking deer, or setting off in longboats, they were never far from extraordinary absorption in their own families\u2019 stories. They simply framed their interests in different terms.\n\nIn any premodern culture we might study, we can identify an obsession with the well-being and management of \u201cancestors.\u201d Every illness, perturbation of the mind, obsession, incapacity, or sorrow will immediately be ascribed to the work of the spirit of a dead family member; it is always about the past. And every society therefore learns to manage these figures from yesteryear with extreme care, with an understanding that an ancestor who has not been properly processed and put to rest will end up taking bitter revenge on us: we might become impotent or grow depressed, marry the wrong person, or fail in our careers.\n\nIn Cambodia, during the annual fifteen-day festival of Pchum Ben, the whole society turns its attention to its ancestors, stretching back as many as seven generations, and makes extensive and costly food offerings in their names, as well as going to temples to carry out rituals and to chant songs for them. It\u2019s understood that the gates of hell have been opened at this time and any ancestor with a difficult character may be on the loose, looking to cause trouble, unless they are appeased by the strenuous efforts of the living.\n\nA group of devotees and Buddhist monks pray inside Wat Lang Ka pagoda during Pchum Ben festival, September 23 2014, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\n\nWe may not go about matters in exactly this way\u2014we may head for the couch rather than the temple. But the underlying dynamics are strikingly similar. We are in essence always striving to ensure that figures from our pasts are not allowed to ruin what remains of our lives.\n\n4 Love\n\nThe main ingredient on which any recovery from serious mental illness depends is also one which, curiously and grievously, never makes an appearance in any medical handbook or psychiatric diagnostic, namely love. The word is so fatefully associated with romance and sentimentality that we overlook its critical role in helping us to keep faith with life at times of overwhelming psychological confusion and sorrow. Love\u2014whether from a friend, a partner, an offspring, or a parent\u2014has an indomitable power to rescue us from mental illness.\n\nWe might go so far as to say that anyone who has ever suffered from mental illness and who recovers will do so\u2014whether they consciously realize it or not\u2014because of an experience of love. And, by extension, no one has ever fallen gravely mentally ill without, somewhere along the line, having suffered from a severe deficit of love. Love turns out to be the guiding strand running through the onset of, and recovery from, our worst episodes of unwellness.\n\nWhat, then, do we mean by love, in its life-giving, mind-healing sense?",

      "content": "## UNCONDITIONAL APPROVAL\n\nWhat frequently assails and derails us when we are sick in our minds is a continuous punishing sense of how terrible we are. We are lacerated by self-hatred. Without any external prompting, we think of ourselves as some of the worst people around, even the worst person on earth. Our own charge sheet against us is definitive: we are \u201cawful,\u201d \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cnasty,\u201d \u201cbad.\u201d We can\u2019t really say much more\u2014and efforts to get us to expand in rational terms may run aground. We often can\u2019t even point to a specific crime, or if we do it doesn\u2019t seem to onlookers to merit quite the pitiless opprobrium we devote to it. In our illness, a primal self-suspicion bursts through our defenses and overtakes our faculties, leaving no room for the slightest gentleness. We are implacably appalled by, and unforgiving of, who we are.\n\nIn such agony, a loving companion can make the difference between suicide and keeping going. Such companions do not try to persuade us of our worth with cold reason; nor do they need to go in for any showy displays of affection. They can just demonstrate that we matter to them in a thousand surreptitious yet fundamental ways. They keep showing up by our bed day after day, they make pleasant conversation about something that won\u2019t in any way make us anxious, they\u2019ve remembered a favorite blanket or a drink, they know how to make a few jokes when these help, and they suggest a nap when they feel us drifting away. They have a good sense of the sources of our pain, but they aren\u2019t pushing us for a big conversation or confession. They can tolerate how ill we are and will stick by us however long it takes. We don\u2019t have to impress them and they won\u2019t worry too much about how scary we are looking or the weird things we might say. They\u2019re not going to give up on us. The disease might take a month or six years or sixty, but they\u2019re going nowhere. We can call them at strange hours. We can sob or we can sound very adult and reasonable. They seem, remarkably, to love us in and of ourselves, for who we are rather than anything we do. They hold a loving mirror to us and help us to tolerate the reflection. It\u2019s pretty much the most beautiful and useful thing in the universe.",

They\u2014the well ones\u2014have come to see us in order to help, but we sense how much they cling to a fundamental difference between the mess we are in and who they think they are. We are the insane ones and they will always fly the flags of health, rationality, and balance. They feel sorry for us from afar: We are the proverbial drowning man and they the observer on dry land.\n\nLoving companions bear no such hints of superiority. They do not judge us as beneath them when we lie crumpled in our pyjamas at midday because they do not fundamentally see themselves as \u201cabove\u201d someone who has fallen through the floor of sanity. We may happen to be very ill at the moment, but it could just as easily have been them if not for the accidents of psychology and of neurochemistry. They don\u2019t oppress us by covertly clinging to a belief in their own inviolable solidity and competence. They throw in little sentences that indicate that they too find life very taxing, that they too are very strange and that they too might one day be in our place.\n\nLOYALTY\n\nAt the heart of many mental traumas is an early experience of abandonment. Someone, when we badly needed them, was not present and their neglect has thrown us off balance ever since. We may find it hard to depend on others in adult life and lack faith that someone won\u2019t run away, or take advantage of us, in turn.\n\nA loving companion intuits this about us and is ready to fight to earn our trust. They know that they cannot blithely assert their loyalty, they will have to prove it, which means not deserting us at moments when others would be tempted to give up. We may try to incite despair and frustration in them as a way of testing the relationship; we may say some awful things and pretend to be indifferent. But if the companion is wise, they will listen and remain unruffled\u2014not because they are weak, but because they understand that a basic piece of repair work around trust is under way.\n\nWe have to be given the chance, which we may have missed out on in childhood, to be a bit more demanding than usual in order to witness conclusively that this isn\u2019t enough to destroy love. We can be ill and still acceptable to another person. How much more real love will feel once it has been shaken by our disease and survived.",

What if someone wants to take them away? What if someone tries to kill them? What if the voices in their head never go away?\n\nThe loving companion does their best to quieten the panic by presenting the future as unknowable in its precise details but fundamentally safe and bearable. They hold open options: it will always be possible to leave town, to live very quietly in a small cottage, to be at home and lead a domestic existence. No one expects them to perform great feats any more, just being is enough. There doesn\u2019t have to be pressure to earn money, to impress strangers, or to be heroic. Surviving is all that matters.\n\nMore importantly, the loving companion insists that they will be there to personally ensure that the future is manageable. When things get terrible, they can be in each other\u2019s presence and hold each other\u2019s spirits.\n\nThe loving companion doesn\u2019t get bored of instilling the same fundamental message: I am here for you and it will be OK. Even if this OK isn\u2019t what one would ideally want, still it will be all right, it will be better than death\u2014which probably remains the alternative in the sufferer\u2019s mind. Quite how the years ahead are going to pan out can\u2019t be determined yet, details will have to be examined later, but what is known already now is that the future won\u2019t need to be unendurable, for a huge basic reason: because there is love.\n\nPATIENCE\n\nWe are, when mentally ill, often extremely tedious in relation to the number of anxieties we desperately need to go through with others. We may want to return again and again to the subject of whether or not we said something terrible to someone at a party hosted by our workplace seven years ago. Or whether we might have unwittingly upset a sexual companion five years before. Or if we might go bankrupt because we didn\u2019t warn our accountant of a small move in our tax affairs.\n\nLoving parents know that the minds of little children are similarly filled with anxiety-inducing and sometimes peculiar questions: Is there a tiger under the bed? What happens if one of the trees comes into the room and takes me away? What if someone laughs at me at school?\n\nThe temptation can be to rush in and give an answer full of blustering, impatient confidence. Of course it will be fine! Nonsense, there\u2019s no tiger! And so on. But the properly loving response is to take the worry as seriously as its progenitor does and address it head on, without scoffing or denying the scale of the concern. We might get out a pad of paper and a pen and run through all the many anxieties. It doesn\u2019t matter if this is the first or the fifteenth time we have done so. Love gives us the patience to enter imaginatively into the other\u2019s worried mind and to try to settle it by sensible examination of what there might be to fear.\n\nWe may be called upon to inspect for imaginary tigers night after night and, on the floor with a torch, should always be ready to go through the many reasons why these big cats have\u2014after all\u2014decided to leave us in peace.",

They may have craved money and status and power to shore up a ghastly feeling of not being able to matter to people unless they had first attracted society\u2019s baubles and prizes.\n\nWhen they break down, what remains unbelievable to these exhausted warriors is that they could ever be loved outside of their performance in the worldly race. Surely it is only their earning potential that counts? Surely it has to be their popularity that matters?\n\nBut now that they are ill and without any of the usual tools to impress, the mentally unwell stand to discover a more complex and salutary lesson. According to the values they have been subsisting on, they are a disgrace and should kill themselves. But with any luck, in the presence of a loving companion, they can start to believe in something far more nuanced and miraculous: that they could be loved without prizes, that true love isn\u2019t about impressing or intimidating someone, that an adult can love another adult a little like a good parent loves their child: not because of anything they have done, but simply and poignantly just because they exist.",

They need to be cuddled, spoken and sung to, played with, held close and looked at with enthusiasm\u2014and will as good as die inside without such care. Every child needs to experience what one could term \u201cprimary parental delight,\u201d a basic feeling that they are limitlessly wanted by those who put them on the earth and are capable of generating intense pleasure through their very being. Without this, a child might survive, but they can never thrive. Their ability to walk the earth freely will always be somewhat in doubt. They will grow up with a sense of being superfluous, disruptive and, at heart, unappealing and shameful.\n\nSuch emotions feed directly into a broad range of mental illnesses: chronic anxiety, self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression. All of these have roots in a sense of not having mattered enough to anyone over long childhood years.\n\nThis defines the challenge for the carer in adulthood. Some of the work will involve making good failures of early provision. The wounded inner child will need to be convinced that what they didn\u2019t receive decades ago could still be available today; that there might still be joy, reassurance, play, and kindness.\n\nIt might seem highly patronizing to tell an adult that they need to be reparented. In fact it\u2019s the height of maturity to recognize that the small version of us must, if we\u2019re ever to get better, allow ourselves another chance to experience what it could feel like to matter limitlessly to a kindly companion.",

      "content": "## COMPANIONSHIP THROUGH THE NIGHT\n\nWay back, the night was when we were especially afraid, and especially needed love and reassurance. The same will be true in our periods of acute mental illness. The night will terrify us, stretching out as a vast and threatening space in which our worst fears and most critical voices will have unlimited dominion.\n\nWe need someone who can help us during these torturous hours, perhaps by remaining awake next to us, or by sleeping in an adjoining bed or room, or by giving us permission to call them whenever panic descends.\n\nWe will know we are properly loved when we can wake up at 3.30 a.m. and have the right to no longer be completely alone with our racing hearts and fearsome anxieties.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be so surprised at the enormous levels of mental illness at large in society. We just need to understand how bad we are collectively at love, how poor we are at being sympathetic, at listening, at offering reassurance, at feeling compassion and at forgiving\u2014and conversely how good we are at hating and shaming and neglecting. We consider ourselves civilized but display levels of love that would shock a primitive tribe or a den of thieves.\n\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve opted to wash our hands of the issue of love and handed responsibility for healing wholesale to the scientists, as though they could culture a complete solution to mental unwellness through their pills. We ignore the fact that the cure largely lies in the emotional realm: in getting better at appeasing each other\u2019s fears, at being generous about our transgressions, at no longer tormenting and maltreating one another for our failures and at sitting together through the darkness in a spirit of care and kindly forbearance.\n\nWe should of course be under no illusion that the love described above will be easy to find. But at least by defining what it could consist of we can grow more clear-eyed about, and less ashamed of, the loneliness that has surreptitiously contributed so much to our suffering.\n\n5 Community\n\nOne of the cruellest aspects of mental illness is that it strips us of our ability to believe that other people might be suffering in the way we are. We aren\u2019t being wilfully egocentric or arrogant; we are condemned by our illness to a feeling that we are uniquely pitiful, uniquely unacceptable, uniquely awful. The central legacy of mental illness, and a major contributor to our suicidal impulses, is a feeling of exceptionalism.\n\nOnce ill, we start to run away from other people. Gatherings become impossible, for we grow pre-emptively terrified of the presumed invulnerability and judgmentalness of those we might meet. We can\u2019t possibly make small talk or concentrate on what someone else is saying when our heads are filled with catastrophic scenarios and an intrusive voice is telling us that we should die. There seems no easy or acceptable way to share with old friends what we have been going through. They knew us as chatty and optimistic, so what will they make of the tortured characters we have become? We start to assume that no one on earth could possibly know\u2014let alone accept\u2014what it is like to be us.\n\nThis is especially tragic because the best cure for mental illness is company. Our disease denies us access to precisely what we most need in order to get better.\n\nIn 1892, the Swiss artist Ferdinand Hodler exhibited The Disappointed Souls. Five figures are pictured in varying states of dejection. We don\u2019t know quite what has gone wrong in their lives, but Hodler\u2019s talent invites us to imagine possibilities: a marriage here, a social disgrace there, a depression, a feeling of overwhelming anxiety  . . . However awful the individual stories might be, the true horror of the painting emerges from the way each crisis is unfolding in complete isolation. The disconsolate figures are only millimeters away from one another, but they might as well be in other countries. It should be so easy to reach out, to share the burden, to lend a comforting hand, to swap stories\u2014and it would be so life-giving. But no fellowship seems possible in this insular hell. Sadness has wrapped each sufferer up in a pitiless sense of their own singularity.\n\nFerdinand Hodler, The Disappointed Souls, 1892.\n\nHodler wasn\u2019t painting any one scene. He intended his work as an allegory of modern society as a whole, with its absence of community, its lonely cities and its alienating technologies. But in this very depiction lies the possibility of redemption. We will start to heal when we realize that we are in fact always extremely close to someone who is as wretched as we are. We should therefore be able to reach out to a similarly broken neighbor and lament in unison. We should learn to come together for a very particular kind of social occasion the whole focus of which would be an exchange of notes on the misery and lacerations of existence.\n\nIn an ideal gathering of the unwell, in a comfortable safe room, we would take it in turns to reveal to one another the torments in our minds. Each of us would detail the latest challenges. We\u2019d hear of how others were going through sleepless nights, were unable to eat, were too terrified to go outside, were hearing voices and had to fight against constant impulses to kill themselves. The material would be dark no doubt, but to hear it would be a balm for our stricken lonely souls.\n\nIdeally, we would keep meeting the same people, week after week, so that our lives would grow entwined with theirs and we could exchange mutual support as we traveled through the valleys of sickness. We would know who was in particular difficulty, who needed tenderness and who might benefit from an ordinary-sounding chat about the garden or the weather.\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible that we are as alone as we currently feel. Biology doesn\u2019t produce complete one-offs. There are fellow creatures among the seven billion of our species. They are there, but we have lost all confidence in our right to find them. We feel isolated not because we are so but because we are unwell. We should dare to believe that a fellow disappointed soul is right now sitting next to us on the bench, waiting for us to make a sign.\n\n6 Psychotherapy\n\nThe discipline of psychotherapy has a deserved place at the center of most accounts of a return to mental health. But what might it involve; what should we expect?",

Our illness masks a truth that is struggling to break through a compliant exterior. There is so much that we are meant to be but are not and are meant to feel but don\u2019t. And in the gap between our notion of respectability and our own reality, there grow silence, shame, anxiety, and guilt.\n\nWe may\u2014in private\u2014be terrified of being exposed as incompetent at work, while having to maintain an aura of poise in front of colleagues. Or we may be hugely frustrated with a partner or a parent while under pressure to show only consideration and calm. Or there may be a secret in our sex lives that seems wholly incompatible with what we hear discussed in the media or among our friends.\n\nTherapy should at last allow us to be honest. We can finally tell someone else the secrets that have pained us for too long. We can tell a non-judgmental, judicious, wise observer about the appalling terrors that we have been assailed by and the incongruous thoughts that run through our minds. We don\u2019t need to be afraid of upsetting or surprising the therapist; they have seen all this before and much more. We can tell them about the crying in the night, the longing to be dead, the anxiety that strikes every morning, the fear of failure, the nature of our sexual tastes. We don\u2019t have to be cheerful, competent, restrained, or admirable. We can be ourselves, in all our complexity and strangeness. We can regress, complain, and lament, without fear of censorship and condemnation. We can start to heal ourselves through honesty.",

Gradually, but only gradually, it will be shown the way to adopt\u2014at points\u2014a false self that knows how to smile, say thank you and not let on about its disagreements. But only if the true self has had its say for a good long while can development be healthy\u2014and Winnicott knew that too many of us are wandering the world without having had the chance to be appropriately awkward and tricky with others before the demand to be polite set in.

They will raise new possibilities with us: Might it not be OK to want something different sexually? Why not contemplate leaving a job that is evidently making us miserable? Must this relationship be for ever? And why? Is it really true that we have never done anything with our lives? Might we not be deserving and attractive?\n\nWe may never have revealed to anyone the peculiar arguments that reverberate inside us and make us feel so hemmed in.

They are wholly porous to their environment so that they can learn French and European table manners in Paris and Inuit and fishing techniques in Iqaluit. But it\u2019s this very porousness that also makes them perilously vulnerable to the emotional peculiarities of their host families. We generalize outward from dubious premises. One particularly difficult father or mother can shape our expectations of men or women over a lifetime. Being emotionally neglected by a distracted parent can instil a lasting sense of worthlessness which no amount of later attention or fame can easily contradict. Fear of a volatile parent\u2019s temper can mold a whole personality in the direction of meekness and compliance.\n\nThe therapist\u2019s role is to incite the patient to get curious about the strangeness and partiality of their introduction into the world. What they might have believed was \u201cnormal\u201d was in fact the result of a very particular, and problematic, set of circumstances. We are granted the right to question the sanity of our early caregivers and, in the process, to recover some of our own.\n\nWe may have inherited a script from childhood that dictates that we should only ever fall in love with people who leave us emotionally unfulfilled, or that we should start to panic that we will be attacked and humiliated the moment we do well professionally. Our script may tell us that no one will understand if we level a complaint against them or if we betray anyone on whom we have come to depend.\n\nA therapist can open our eyes to how we may be following a script simply because it feels familiar, not because it is rational or in any sense connected to our satisfaction, and thereby offer us a chance to invent newer and more satisfying ways to lead our lives.",

That\u2019s not how it feels of course. From the inside, our minds have probably never seemed so busy and so focused. From the moment we wake up in panic and self-disgust, we are ruminating, pondering, exploring catastrophic scenarios, scanning our past, attacking ourselves for things we have done and not done, questioning our legitimacy, talking to ourselves about how repulsive we are, paying attention to strange voices telling us that we are evil and sick and headed for the worst\u2014and wondering whether and how we should kill ourselves. Our minds don\u2019t give us a moment of respite. We may rub our temples to cool them down but when we eventually fall asleep we are exhausted by the marathons our thoughts have run inside us.\n\nNevertheless, we may still want to insist\u2014for the kindest and most redemptive of reasons\u2014that we have not been thinking at all, that none of this hive of activity deserves the title of thinking; it is just illness.\n\nTo be mentally ill is to be swamped by secretions of fear, self-hatred, and despair that, like surging seawater through a pumping station control desk, knock out all our higher faculties, all our normal ability to sensibly distinguish one thing from another, to find perspective, to weigh arguments judiciously, to see the wood for the trees, to correctly assess danger, to plan realistically for the future, to determine risks and opportunities, and, most importantly, to be kind and generous to ourselves.\n\nNone of these faculties function any longer, but\u2014and this is the true nastiness of the illness\u2014we are never and nowhere alerted to our loss. We are both very ill and very unaware. It looks as though we are continuing to think as we have always done, with all our usual intelligence and reliability, but that we just have a lot more to worry about. Nowhere along the way does our mind do us the honor of telling us that it has begun to look at reality through a distorted lens, that it has, at some point in the day, to all intents and purposes stopped working. No bell goes off, no hazard lights flash.\n\nYet the truth is that we have lost command of about a third of our minds and are pulling together our ideas from the most degenerate, traumatized, unreliable, and vicious aspects of ourselves. It\u2019s as if a group of terrorists had donned white coats and were impersonating prestigious scientists in order to lay out a set of vicious theories and prognoses.\n\nOnce we have been through a few cycles of distorted thinking and finally recovered contact with reality, we should do ourselves the kindness of accepting that, on an intermittent basis, we will lose command of our higher faculties. There is nothing embarrassing in recognizing the possibility and accommodating ourselves to it very carefully.\n\nWe should get better at detecting when illness might be drawing in, what the triggers for it might be. Then, when it is upon us, we should do and decide nothing. We shouldn\u2019t send emails or deliver judgment on our lives or plan for the future. We should, as much as possible, stop all mental activity and rest. We might listen to music, have a long bath, watch something untaxing on television, and perhaps take a calming pill.\n\nWe should also try to plug our brain into the brain of someone else, to benefit from their greater powers of reason. If we have a trusted friend or therapist on whom we can call at such moments, we should ask them if they might help recalibrate and regulate our thoughts with an injection of their wisdom and insight. We should willingly put them in charge of determining how things are for us. They should be allowed to tell us what we are worth, what we have done, what there is to worry about and that we should do our best to discount the doom-laden signals that emerge from inside us. They may be able to come up with innovative ideas that we\u2019re no longer capable of recognizing\u2014and that could save us. They might tell us that it\u2019s OK to have secrets or that compromise is not always a disaster\u2014concepts that our panicked minds would have had no way of conceptualizing.\n\nWe should strive to become thinkers who can acknowledge when they are no longer able to think.",

What is pernicious about this kind of worrying is that it attaches itself to genuine features of the here and now, presenting itself as reasonable. But on closer examination it clearly isn\u2019t. There is always something to be alarmed by: turbulence in the economy, things that go wrong with our bodies, reputations rising and falling . . . But what should eventually alert us to the peculiarity of our position is the duration, scale, and repetitiveness of our worries. We should learn to see that we are essentially worried all the time about something. The focus may shift, but what is constant is our insecurity about existence. It is in such situations that a therapist may make a hugely useful intervention, pointing out that the way we worry about the future is in fact telling us a huge amount about our past. More specifically, we are worried right now in a way that mirrors the panic we once felt as children; we are greeting the challenges of the adult world with the defenseless panic of the child we once were. What we are doing in the process is exchanging the pain of remembering the difficult past for a sense of foreboding around the future. The catastrophe we fear is going to happen has already happened.\n\nSo sealed off are our memories, we project them forward, where they greet us as apprehensions of what is to come. Instead, we should identify them as legacies of unmasterable past anxiety. The good therapist becomes aware of the correct source of the anxiety\u2014and doesn\u2019t let go of their insight. They will listen politely and generously to our description of our current panic: What will happen in our job, have we studied enough, what if our enemies gang up on us? But then they will gently try to shift the conversation to the past, to show us that the future looks so fearful because we are being counterproductively loyal to the terrors of an earlier age, which we now need to remember, to feel sad about, and then eventually to mourn and move on from. We should be disloyal to those who brought us up in an atmosphere of fear in order to save what remains of life from always appearing doom-laden. We may be trying to stay close to them by continuing to panic alongside them, but we owe it to ourselves to break the circle of worry and to make our future different from the past by remembering, localizing, and mourning what belonged to yesterday even as it pretends to be about tomorrow.",

      "content": "## REVISITING OUR YOUNGER SELVES\n\nFor many of us, childhood was a traumatically confusing and lonely time as we were placed in circumstances that far outstripped our ability to understand, contextualize, and properly apportion blame. As a result, we have grown up fundamentally mistaken about who we are and what we might deserve.\n\nReturning to health can involve learning to go back to the child we once were, seeing ourselves in all our early helplessness and confusion, and bringing ourselves the benefit of adult compassion and insight. A visual metaphor for what this might involve comes in the work of the Japanese photographer Chino Otsuka, who, in a project called \u201cImagine Finding Me,\u201d located old pictures of herself in a variety of childhood settings and then inserted her current self next to the child she once was. Thirty-three-year-old Otsuka slipped in beside ten-year-old Otsuka outside a boulangerie in Paris, popped up next to her on a beach in Japan, and, one winter, gave her a hand with a snowman she was building after a heavy snowfall.\n\nChino Otsuka, 1982 and 2005, Paris, France, from the series \u201cImagine Finding Me,\u201d 2005.\n\nChino Otsuka, 1976 and 2005, Kamakura, Japan, from the series \u201cImagine Finding Me,\u201d 2005.\n\nChino Otsuka, 1980 and 2009, Nagayama, Japan, from the series \u201cImagine Finding Me,\u201d 2009.\n\nThis deceptively simple idea latches on to a powerful fantasy: that the older us could go back to help the younger us. How extraordinary it would be if we could give our comparatively frail and bereft tiny self the benefit of our adult strength, experience, poise, and confidence. If only we could return to provide ourselves with answers, to explain the adults around us and sometimes just to offer ourselves a consoling hug. We would be much more able now to navigate what we endured with such pain then. We would tell ourselves not to worry, we would guarantee that we were lovable and precious, we would hold ourselves through the long nights.\n\nThis might sound merely fantastical, but in fact it has practical applications in therapy. The reality is that our childhood selves still exist: their ghosts still wander around the old vacation destinations, they\u2019re still having bath time in the old house, they\u2019re still at school on winter mornings, and they are still crying at night in bed. No part of us ever really dies; our younger selves continue at some concurrent level in the unconscious and will cause us pain for as long as they remain fearful and abandoned.\n\nThe priority is therefore to go back and, just like Otsuka in her project, stand beside our younger selves in all their difficulties. We should slip into our bed the night we were sobbing after having been shouted at. We should take ourselves to school and sit at the desk next to ours and tell ourselves what we so needed to hear but never did. We should stand up to particular adults and make the speeches we were too inarticulate to utter. Our lost sad child is still inside us and won\u2019t let us rest until we have been able to witness and appease them.\n\nThrough therapy, we will get better once we have located the scenes that truly matter and then comforted and reparented ourselves back to health.\n\nFor all these life-saving functions of therapy, we should add that most therapists will not match the exalted hopes we have of them. This merely reflects the realities of the distribution of talent\u2014which we should be ready for and accommodate ourselves to. Just as we can have the highest estimation of art but still find most practicing artists mediocre, so most therapists we come across are likely to be less than what they should be. We shouldn\u2019t despair or blame the profession as a whole; we should trust our instincts, politely leave, and keep searching until we find someone with the kindness, intellectual grit, humor, insight, and warmth we need. We will be very lucky if we find this therapeutic figure at once, but the eventual prize should make even the longest search worthwhile.\n\n7 Modernity\n\nPeople have fallen prey to mental illness for as long as our species has been in existence, so it could sound naive or punitive to single out any one era as especially responsible for generating mental troubles. Nevertheless, certain periods of history seem capable of bringing together such a confluence of aggravating factors and of so perfectly testing our emotional limits that they deserve to be considered as causes of mental unwellness in and of themselves.\n\nSuch may be the case with our own era, a time known as modernity which, notwithstanding its extraordinary technological creativity, overall peaceability, and increasing wealth, has imperiled our mental health as few ages before it ever have. The illnesses bequeathed to us by modern times may manifest themselves very personally within us, but a great many of their causes lie in the broader dynamics of society, economics, and politics.\n\nWe would do well to identify the myriad ways in which our age renders our mental lives more challenging than they should be\u2014and then find techniques to sidestep the worst of our contemporary ills.",

Whereas past ages resigned themselves to offering modest destinies to most of their citizens, modernity has insisted that everyone\u2014whatever their background or families of origin\u2014should be capable of realizing the most stellar feats. No longer should anything\u2014education, background, race, creed\u2014stand in the way of ambition.\n\nThis has been in its way an incomparably generous philosophy. But it has also, in the background, set up the ideal preconditions for mental instability. It is one thing to promise us all a chance of success, it is another to hint\u2014as our era constantly does\u2014that a modest destiny is essentially unacceptable. While praising lives of outsized accomplishment, our era has thrown a shadow over the ordinary lives that most of us will by necessity continue to lead. The norm has ceased to be enough. We cannot be average without at the same time having to think of ourselves as being what our age resents above all else: losers.",

The matter lay in the hands of the gods or of fortune, of luck or, more likely, of rigged odds. No one expected the world to be \u201cfair,\u201d so it was natural to offer sympathy to oneself and others at the inevitable moments of failure.\n\nModernity has refused to accept this state of affairs. It has fought with unparalleled energy, whether in education, business, politics, or family life, to create a world that can be deemed just, one in which those who deserve to get to the top are able to rise and where rewards are rightfully apportioned to the most deserving candidates.\n\nThough this too may sound like an advance, it carries a nasty sting in its tail, for if one is committed to believing in an order of things whereby those who achieve success invariably deserve to do so, then one is simultaneously signing on to a vision of existence in which those who fail must, with equal fairness, be deserving of their fate. In a meritocracy, an element of justice enters into the distribution of punishment as well as rewards.\n\nThe burden of personal responsibility grows exponentially and explains why this age has seen a corresponding increase in rates of suicide, since the blame for a life that has gone awry can only reside narrowly within each of us. We can no longer look elsewhere to explain why we have floundered; we can no longer blame the gods or bad luck. Winners make their own luck, goes the modern mantra, so we must logically also pay the full, unmitigated price for our failures.\n\nENVY\n\nFor most of history, we were protected from the ravages of envy by a class structure that denied most of life\u2019s advantages to all but a narrow and preselected few. Most of us had very little, but we also knew that there was no alternative to penury and that it was therefore not for us to gape with longing and desire at those with finer homes and carriages, horses and titles.\n\nModernity has freed us from such class-bound strictures. We are repeatedly informed that everyone is born equal and therefore we can and should aspire to the most gilded of lives, comparing ourselves to everyone else in our societies. We no longer believe in innate aristocrats or born peasants; we are runners on a notionally level playing field, able to reach whatever we aim for depending on our investments of imagination and energy. This means that the eventual gaps in social status and material wealth are no longer, as they used to be, an unremarkable feature of the natural order; instead they are a devastating reminder that the good life has eluded our grasp.\n\nIt becomes painful and at points intolerable to hear about old school acquaintances who are now scaling the heights while we remain, for causes we cannot overcome, tethered to more lowly stations. We are condemned to perpetual inadequacy in a radically unequal world of self-declared equals.",

Life was understood to be, for the most part, a matter of regret, longing, failure, incompleteness, and sadness. Buddhism declared that life itself was suffering; the Judaeo-Christian tradition emphasized that we were all the heirs of Adam and Eve, broken and tarred by sin, condemned to grief outside the gates of paradise. The situation was dark but, crucially, communally so. There was no danger of feeling isolated with one\u2019s woes; to exist was automatically to sign up to suffering.\n\nModernity has heroically thrown off such inbuilt pessimism. It is an age of resolute good cheer, of faith in the future and in our ability to overcome whatever challenges we face through willpower and technology. Pessimism has been recategorized as a disease.\n\nBut though the trajectory of humankind may, arguably, be on an upward curve, the arc of every life never manages to escape fearsome degrees of pain and loss. The human race may be getting happier, but each one of us remains exposed to a devastating range of sorrows. Except that there is now an added burden in weeping when we are meant to smile and in wanting to hide when others are insisting that we step out and celebrate. Our sadness starts to seem like a personal curse rather than what it more fairly always is: an inevitable feature of being alive.",

God has died and there is now little we can turn to, intone in front of, or beg for deliverance from when times grow hard. We dwell in a world ruled by the pitiless laws of science in which relief is on offer only from psychotherapists or psychiatric doctors, who equate our problems narrowly with our own personal histories and biology. It feels, for most of us, impossible to weep in temples and churches. We scour the universe for clues as to why we are here and what we are meant to do with our troubles, and hear back only static and silence.\n\nAt the same time, the disappearance of religion means that humankind looms ever larger in our own imaginations. There is nothing left to relativize us. We used to be put in our place by contact with the spiritual realm. Every weekend, we would be shepherded into gloriously rendered halls and reminded of what a puny thing mankind was, how ridiculous were all our achievements, and how flawed and frail we were next to the majesty of God. The differences between human beings were as nothing next to the differences between us and the Almighty. We were usefully relativized by the shadow of the divine.\n\nNow mankind is the measure of all things. Our heroes are drawn only from our own kind, our myths reference only ourselves and our strengths.

But this emphasis serves only to aggravate our isolation and renders our relationships more fractious than they should be, for no single person, however extraordinary, can ever replace our need for a more broadly based circle of support.

We have surrounded ourselves by gadgets that give us minute-by-minute insights into the perturbed and excited minds of billions of others\u2014and that along the way deny us all necessary access to stillness, distance, and perspective, let alone time for self-knowledge and reflection. We grow convinced of the unerring importance of everything in the near term and can set nothing in its broader context. We pass our own mental perturbations on to one another under the guise of keeping ourselves \u201cinformed.\u201d The media spreads our madness virally and without respite. We come under pressure to know at all times \u201cwhat is going on,\u201d without realizing how much we have abandoned ourselves to an enervating collective frenzy at the cost of our serenity and self-possession.\n\nSo pernicious are the trends of modernity, so greatly do they affect our chances of mental well-being, that sanity demands we exercise immense caution around our era and, as quietly as we need to, enter a state of what could be termed internal exile from some of its pressures. We may continue to benefit from the advantages of the modern age while simultaneously creating a wide berth between ourselves and its more destructive and cruel psychological ideals.\n\nTo do so, we might draw on a range of counter-cyclical ideas.\n\nMODESTY\n\nWe know the attractions of extraordinary lives well enough: the glamour, the acclaim, the material abundance . . . What can be less familiar to us is their costs: the destruction of emotional stability, the frenetic activity, the lack of time in which to absorb experiences, the envy and hostility that success arouses, the fear of retribution, and the dread of downfall.\n\nOnce we have properly surveyed the merits and demerits on offer, we may willingly choose to side with what the modern age typically considers to be a disaster: a quiet life. This is not from any lack of ambition, but from a more focused aspiration for what we now recognize to be the primordial ingredient of happiness: peace of mind.\n\nWe might choose to live outside a large metropolis, not to push ourselves forward for promotion, to avoid the limelight, and to do a satisfactory but undramatic kind of work. We can discover the subtle greatness of a life in which we exercise our virtues on a domestic canvas, in which we do not seek to be known by people we don\u2019t ourselves know and in which the intricate love of a few carefully chosen souls replaces the hurried attentions of a host of unfaithful strangers. In such quiet lives, we can go to bed early, avoid functions with people we despise, work only for the money we need to secure a materially adequate standard of living, drop out of the status race, and refuse to assess ourselves according to the alien standards of a corrupt media.\n\nWe will have liberated ourselves from the madness of the age when we can look on loud and heroic lives\u2014perhaps led by people we once knew\u2014and with good faith say that this is not for us, that we are happier where we are, because we at last understand what we really require to survive mentally: cosiness, connection, and an ongoing lack of drama.",

      "tags": "inner peace, self-doubt, sleep, solitude, introspection",
      "content": "## AN INTERNAL HUT\n\nWe might, in order to escape modernity totally, seek to move to a hut somewhere far away. We would dwell amid nature with our own thoughts and, ideally, a circle of supportive friends. We would not need to be harried and pressured to conform to foreign ideals of success. But moving ourselves physically may not be necessary. What we may need is not so much an actual hut as a hut inside our own minds, one to which we can retreat when we know that we are being assailed by values that are inimical to our sense of balance and self-love. We may continue to wander through the modern world, to all intents and purposes just another obedient citizen of its value system, while internally highly suspicious of the messages we are receiving and committed to replacing them with ones imbued with far greater kindness and justice.\n\nWe can blame ourselves too much for our mental suffering. It is not that we are personally fragile but merely that we are living in a high-tech age that routinely smashes its more sensitive members to pieces through adherence to what will one day be recognized as a grossly primitive and unimaginative ethos.\n\n8 Self-Compassion\n\nIf there is one generalization we can hazard about those who end up mentally unwell, we could say that they are masters at being very nasty to themselves.\n\nThe worst kind of nastiness doesn\u2019t have to involve shouting at oneself or calling oneself an idiot, though this might happen too. It means that one part of us continually drives the other toward self-doubt, fear, paranoia, shame, and despair, without revealing that it is doing this or that there might be other options available. Panic and self-flagellation become identified with safety and virtue. No attention is drawn toward the partiality of the choices that are being made internally\u2014otherwise the game would be up. Self-loathing may be the order of the day but it is never presented as such. We just think that we are \u201cnormal,\u201d hard-headed and interpreting reality as it truly is.\n\nRelease from the grip of self-loathing therefore has to start with an awareness of what we are doing to ourselves\u2014and what the alternatives might be. For example, we might start to notice that no sooner has something nice happened to us than we set about wondering when something awful will strike in revenge; that every success has to be ruined by a feeling of foreboding and guilt; that every potentially pleasant day ends up marred by panic or a sense of loss; that we spontaneously imagine that everyone must hate us and that the worst things are being said about us the moment we leave any room.\n\nNone of this looks on the surface like \u201cnastiness.\u201d We could just say that we have a \u201cworried mind\u201d or a \u201cregretful temperament.\u201d But it is useful to group these ideas under a single title in order to fully identify the direction in which they point: toward the systematic destruction of any pleasure in being ourselves. This is, when we think about it, a very nasty thing indeed to do to someone. Without realizing it, we are committed to throttling our chances of contentment. We dwell inside a mind in which every good element has to be spoilt and every vicious, destructive, alarming, and cruel thought has to be honored.\n\nAs an experiment, we might imagine trying to be as kind as possible to our own minds, in order to see how differently things might unfold. Rather than dragging every last deformed and mean idea into the theater of consciousness, we could dare to be vigilant about only presenting our minds with the very kindest and most reassuring ideas. The moment we leave a room, we could ruthlessly prevent thoughts about our unacceptability from manifesting themselves in the usual way; they might beg to be let in, claiming all sorts of reasons why they should be, but for once we could give them a firm \u201cno.\u201d If they keep trying to force their way into our minds, we might put on a piece of music or do some gardening\u2014anything other than allow destructive thoughts to have their normal hold over us.\n\nLikewise, when the old familiar thought about the future being terrible knocks at the door, we might refuse to let it in. When we wake up with the traditional burden of guilt about our past mistakes, we might decide to pay no attention. We then realize that we have agency over the things that fill our minds and that we don\u2019t have to surrender control to our masochistic stage manager at every turn.\n\nWe might along the way start to appreciate that other people do not give their worst thoughts unlimited sway. They don\u2019t give endless time to ideas of their own dreadfulness or their likely destruction. They don\u2019t allow whole days to be lost in catastrophic forebodings. And one way to make sense of the reason for this is that they are fundamentally, without being aware of it in this way, kind to themselves ; they are not in the business of torturing their own spirits.\n\nWhere does this unconscious impulse to be unkind to ourselves come from? How is the choice to torture ourselves made? We can hazard another generalization. The way we treat ourselves is an internalization of the way others once treated us, either directly in the sense of how they spoke to us or indirectly in the sense of how they behaved around us, which could have included ignoring us or openly displaying a preference for someone else.\n\nOur early caregivers did not literally instruct us to worry about our right to exist or tell us to panic constantly about what might happen next. But the way that our minds now work bears the imprint of their relationship to us; it is an extrapolation from their messages of fear and ridicule, humiliation and shame, which we have absorbed as careful students.\n\nTo get a measure of where we stand on the spectrum of self-love, we need only ask ourselves a very simple question\u2014one that we have nevertheless ignored for far too long: How much do I like myself? If the answer immediately and intuitively comes back that we feel we are loathsome, there is a history that we urgently need to consider and are, conveniently for our self-torturing minds, choosing to ignore. The contempt we habitually show ourselves is neither fair nor right. We should spot the oddity and partiality of treating ourselves with a viciousness that we wouldn\u2019t accord to our worst enemies.\n\nThis self-hatred breeds low self-confidence and a continual fear of disaster. Terrible things must, after all, happen to terrible people. We are denied any confidence in ourselves as workers, parents, friends, and humans more broadly, and are terrified both when things go well, because our comeuppance is sure to be just around the corner, and when we contemplate the future, which must be filled with dreadful and threatening prospects. It\u2019s one of the more unexpected features of mental life that what manifests itself as \u201canxiety\u201d is really, at heart, a form of intense self-suspicion.\n\nFor a long time, self-hatred can be disguised within an outwardly normal life. The destruction blends in. But just how dangerous and unfair we are being to ourselves is likely to come to the fore when we hit a crisis, making some sort of a mistake or encountering a reversal. At moments when anyone might experience a dip in their degrees of self-love and confidence, we enter a completely different and more perilous zone. The bad news confirms every one of our savage impulses and self-suspicions. It kick-starts efforts to conclusively tear ourselves apart. Not only are we somewhat in trouble and responsible; we are, as we tell ourselves, a catastrophe and despicable, foul and damned. Self-torture can quickly end up with compulsive thoughts of self-extinction.\n\nPeople who commit suicide aren\u2019t those for whom a few things have gone very wrong; they are people who have encountered some otherwise survivable reversals against a background of fierce self-hatred. It is the self-hatred that will end up killing them, not the apparent subjects of their panic and sorrow.\n\nAs ever, salvation comes through self-awareness. There is nothing inevitable about self-hatred. We are treating ourselves unkindly because people were in the past not especially kind to us\u2014and we are being touchingly yet dangerously loyal to their philosophies of derision. Harshness can have a glamour all of its own; it can seem the more serious and powerful approach to take toward our characters, as though we were doing ourselves a favor, and even securing our safety, by whipping our consciences as hard as possible.\n\nBut if we\u2019re to stay alive, we need radically to redraw our moral code and return to kindness the prestige that it should always have had. Kindness to ourselves is the single most necessary quality for success and endurance. That we spent so long on the side of cruelty is a sign not of its utility, but of the scale of the distortions we have inherited from the past. We have learned far too much about a lack of mercy, about panic, about self-suspicion and finding oneself pitiful. Now, when we have felt the temptations of suicide, we need to rediscover the virtues of forgiveness, mercy, calm, and gentleness. And when we panic and feel intensely anxious about the future, we need to remember that we are in essence worrying about our fundamental legitimacy and lovability. Our survival depends on a swift mastery of the varied arts of self-compassion.\n\n9 Gratitude\n\nA particularly unfortunate consequence of mental illness is its power to close us off from the world, from its beauty, its interest, and its power to distract us from ourselves. We are liable to be so engulfed in what feels like a life-or-death struggle, we forget that there is anything outside the walls of our own minds. Every morning is likely to begin with fear and trepidation; it feels like a close-run thing whether we will make it to evening. In the circumstances, there is little chance to observe the dawn, we don\u2019t hear the birdsong, and we miss the way the rising sun briefly dressed the horizon in a mantle of purple gold.\n\nOnce upon a time, when we were children, we were champions at observation. A simple walk to the park offered a treasury of discoveries. There was the brick wall along which we liked to run our hands; there was an ant that we saw on the sidewalk and followed until it disappeared into a mysterious hole just wide enough to take its body; there was a small yellow flower growing in some rubble whose stem we caressed and whose petals we rubbed against our cheek. There were the clouds we observed, stretching and distending themselves like swirls of milk in coffee; there were the three gigantic trees whose weathered bark we ran our nails across and wanted, if we\u2019d been able, to knead and wrap ourselves in.\n\nIt can feel as if there is no time for such frivolities now. Adult life has grown drained of delight. We spend hours poring over our emotions with therapists, we visit psychiatric doctors, we sit in ugly rooms discussing our pains with strangers.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that we have resolutely turned our minds against appreciation. We simply lack encouragement\u2014and, we might say, permission. We need to have it confirmed to us by some external source that it is not trivial to look up from ourselves for a while, that the capacity to find delight in so-called \u201csmall things\u201d is at the core of recovery and strength. Appreciation may once have been automatic but that isn\u2019t an argument against a little artificiality in restarting its engines. We may need to be nudged, occasionally, to pause with our travails and take a moment to look around. The huge things won\u2019t be solved quickly. We\u2019re going to be with anxiety and despair for a little while longer yet. But that is no reason to shun moments of relief.\n\nIt is artists who may best stimulate our appetite for observing the world through the evidence of their own heightened sensitivities. We might consider, for example, the work of Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u201394), an exceptionally generous observer of our place on the earth. He looked closely at summer fruit, skies, the view from the window in mid-afternoon, the atmosphere in the park. In 1875, while staying in his family\u2019s home in Yerres, south of Paris, he went down to the river on a gray day and grew fascinated by the patterns made by large drops of summer rain on the surface of the water. We have seen such a sight hundreds of times before, but are unlikely\u2014for a long while at least\u2014to have given it its due, to have grown appropriately mesmerized by the complex geometries of interlocking circles, by the refractions of light, by the variegated sounds of water falling into water.\n\nGustave Caillebotte, Yerres, Effect of Rain, 1875.\n\nCaillebotte\u2019s painting isn\u2019t about our distress. It doesn\u2019t know anything about the broken relationship with our spouse, our troubles with lawyers, our financial anxieties, our fear of the future . . . But it seems to grasp that such things might exist and yet insist that they do not, right now, need to swallow the whole of our lives. For a moment or two, we can slip out of ourselves, pause on our walk by the riverbank and take in something that will remind us that it is worth keeping on with existence.\n\nWe might, following the example of Caillebotte, sometimes interrupt our internal dialogue in order to study daisies in jars, someone\u2019s hands, an old map, a photo from childhood, a pencil on a new sheet of paper. We have suffered so much, we are so aware of all that is difficult and arduous, but we have not been barred from adopting the wide-eyedness of children and artists. Indeed, it is against the backdrop of our difficulties that beauty becomes not just pleasing but moving\u2014a reminder of our true home, to which we so long to return.\n\nIn our efforts to appreciate what is still good, we might also take a lead from the exceptionally busy Yinzhen (1678\u20131735), fifth emperor of China\u2019s Qing dynasty, who was much preoccupied with reforming his country\u2019s taxation system and rooting out corruption in local officials, but nevertheless found the time to take his son and a few of his favorite courtiers out for a picnic in the fields near Beijing, in order to look at the flowers, at some point around 1725.\n\nIt is touching to note the solemn expression of the Emperor, who has interrupted the affairs of state for something as easy to overlook as some spring flowers. Yinzhen was known to have been a deeply pious and serious man, but he evidently retained a secure hold on life\u2019s real priorities, nudging us to recalibrate our own hierarchy of importance in the direction of the overlooked beauty of the everyday. If an emperor can do this, then we\u2014for all our afflictions\u2014can too.\n\nThe Yongzheng Emperor Admiring Flowers, c. 1725.\n\nMuch remains imperfect; most of us have lives that are not as we would want them to be. But this should not become a reason to refuse modest pleasures. We should be sure to carve out moments when, despite everything, we can still savor incidental arguments for hope, sweetness, and an end to suffering.\n\n10 Routines\n\nWe understand that in order to create a world-class athlete, it isn\u2019t enough to work on someone\u2019s muscle strength. We need to watch how they sleep, what they eat, the company they keep, the clothes they wear. Similar care is taken when trying to train elite soldiers or musicians; a whole way of life has to be examined and adjusted in order to deliver the right results. The foremost example of this totalizing approach can be found in the history of religions. Behind the invention of the monastery is the notion that, in order to fashion a mind that can focus appropriately on the divine, a great many details will need to be considered and rethought: what sort of hairstyle someone has, the kind of material their tunic is made out of, what time they have breakfast, how they sit when they read or contemplate and what the view should look like out of the window.\n\nUnderpinning such interest is a conception of the human being as immensely susceptible to the influence of what we in the secular realm tend to call, with fateful neglect, \u201csmall things.\u201d It seldom occurs to us to trace the connection between apparently incidental sensory and physical routines and what passes through our minds. We treat the mind as a more or less wholly isolated organ that can continue to function as we would want it to whatever food we serve it, however much rest we give it and whatever the architectural or natural vistas that lie before its eyes. We implicitly deem it impossible that our thoughts could be heavily colored by the sort of light we are exposed to, the articles we read, or the kind of exercise we take. No such indifference was ever permitted in Zen Buddhism or Catholicism. These careful belief systems developed elaborate traditions around posture, tea drinking, breathing, and gardening because they did not subscribe to our walled-off vision of the mind. They saw continuity between beliefs and, among other elements, how we bathe, the words we say on waking up, the kind of crockery we use, and the speed at which we eat our dinner.\n\nWe should take inspiration from this spiritual vigilance in the quest for our own mental health. We should borrow from the manic sensitivity of religions to imagine spaces and routines that can give our minds the best possible chances of finding and then holding on to robust reasons to keep living.\n\nHere are some of the elements we might consider.\n\nSLEEP\n\nPart of the reason why many of us have a tangled and unhelpful relationship with sleep can be traced back to the way we first learned about the subject many years ago. Parents of small children tend to be very careful about bedtimes. They favor early nights, give their babies plenty of naps throughout the day, think a lot about black-out curtains, are quick to diagnose many instances of bad temper as stemming from a background deficit of rest and, while they may be indulgent in some areas, are likely to be entirely implacable in any negotiation over routines.\n\nNone of this is remotely altruistic: tired small children are a nightmare to look after. Every reversal becomes a drama, every disappointment turns into a catastrophe, and every excitement shifts into mania. A halfway decent adult existence is impossible alongside a tired child. Self-interest necessitates totalitarianism.\n\nBut while a draconian philosophy is useful in the early years, it can set up an awkward dynamic in an offspring\u2019s mind as adolescence sets in. Growing up and asserting their independence and individuality can then become associated with a newly defiant and cavalier approach to bedtimes. Not for a newly empowered young adult the strictures and denying rules of the past. Why bother to put the light out by ten or even midnight, given that they are so obviously no longer a toddler? And as they have no more use for nappies, why worry that they are still finishing something on the computer as the first signs of dawn appear in the eastern sky?\n\nWhat is thereby missed is how much every adult shares in a young child\u2019s sensitivity to a shortfall of sleep. Just like our younger selves, we do not automatically have a reasonable view of our own prospects or condition. There are many different ways of telling the stories of our lives, ranging from optimistic accounts of progress mixed with noble defeats to tragic narratives of thorough going stupidity and unforgivable errors. What determines the difference between madness and sanity may be nothing grander, but then again nothing more critical, than how long our heads have been allowed to lie on a pillow in the preceding hours.\n\nIt\u2019s especially unfortunate that this connection is so easy to miss. No bells go off in our minds warning us that we are running low on nocturnal nectar; there are no parents around any longer to nag us up to our rooms; plenty of well-meaning friends invite us out for meals that begin at 9 p.m.; our screens never fail to have something new and interesting to tell us at every hour. What\u2019s more, no stylish or authoritative figures in the public realm ever seem to urge us to turn in early or proudly show off their cautious bedtime routines. Being meticulous about sleep is something that only a very dull or defeated person would care about.\n\nAs a result, we start to believe many dark things with doomful ease: that our relationship is over, that everyone hates us, that our lives are meaningless, and that human existence is a cosmic joke. As Friedrich Nietzsche knew, \u201cWhen we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.\u201d We go mad from tiredness long before we notice the role that exhaustion is playing in stealing our sanity.\n\nWe need to recover some of the wisdom of our early years. We may be a sizeable height, holding down an important job, and capable of performing impressive feats, but in terms of our vulnerability to emotional chaos, we are no more robust than a very young infant. Whenever we sense our spirits sinking and folly and anxiety pressing in on us, we should abandon all endeavors and head to the bedroom. We should be as proud of our regimented sleep patterns as we are of a neat house or a flourishing career.\n\nUnderpinning our care should be modesty. While thinking through our problems is crucial to our health, to attempt to think without enough sleep is worse than not thinking at all. The thinking we do when tired is vindictive and sloppy. It misses important details, gives the advantage to our enemies, and hands victory to the evangelists of sadness. It isn\u2019t disrespectful to the power of the mind to insist that we shouldn\u2019t attempt to fire up this machine unless and until it has been adequately restored to health\u2014like a powerful rocket or exquisite motorboat that we wouldn\u2019t dare to activate unless we could be sure of a clear sky or a calm sea.\n\nUnderstanding our vulnerability, we should never take seriously any worry that suddenly appears extremely pressing after ten in the evening. What we panic about in the early hours should automatically be discounted. No large conversation or argument should ever be undertaken past nine o\u2019clock.\n\nBeing careful doesn\u2019t just apply to the night. At varied points in the day, when we are overwhelmed, we should know to stop and hoist a white flag. It may look as if we should keep trying to fight our demons. In fact, we need to sidestep them with a nap. We may feel guilty, but it is lazier and more irresponsible to try to keep going than it is to know the game is up for now. There is never anything shameful in admitting we can\u2019t cope. It\u2019s this very knowledge that guarantees us a chance to fight another round soon.\n\nWhen we lie in bed, it makes sense to think of ourselves as akin to a smaller, furry mammal, a rabbit or perhaps a squirrel. We should lift our knees up very close to our chests and pull our duvets over our heads. We might soak a whole patch of the pillow with our tears. We should metaphorically stroke our own weary foreheads as a loving adult might once have done. Grown-up life is intolerably hard and we should be allowed to know and lament this.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t feel weird in our weepy-squirrel position. Other people go to immense lengths to hide that they do, or would like to do, the very same sort of thing. We need to know someone extremely well\u2014better than we know 99 percent of humanity\u2014before they will let us in on the scale of their despair and anxiety and their longings for a cozy, safe nook. It looks childlike but it is in fact the essence of adulthood to recognize and make space for our regressive tendencies.\n\nWhat the curled-squirrel position indicates is that not all mental problems can be solved by active reasoning. Not thinking consciously should also be deemed a part of the mind\u2019s work. Being curled up in bed allows our minds to do a different sort of thinking, the sort that can take place when we are no longer impatiently looking for results, when the usual hectoring conscious self takes a break and lets the mind do what it will for a time. It is then, paradoxically, that certain richer, more creative ideas can have the peace and freedom to coalesce, as they may do when we are out for a walk or idling in a cafe. Thinking isn\u2019t what we do best when it\u2019s all we\u2019re meant to do.\n\nThere remain plenty of reasons to live. We simply may not be able to see them until we have allowed ourselves the privilege of a weepy nap or a long night\u2019s sleep.\n\nFOOD\n\nMental illness is often bound up with a sense of shame, self-disgust, and self-flagellation. We scour our past for reasons to hate who we are. We appear in our own eyes as unworthy and despicable candidates who should never have been allowed to be.\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of the close connection between diet and mental health that such thoughts are particularly likely to come to the fore following certain sorts of meals. After a lunch or dinner soaked in trans fat and sodium nitrate, processed sugar and corn syrup, saccharin and palm oil, potassium benzoate and butylated hydroxyanisole, reasons for our non-existence can appear especially persuasive.\n\nIn a quest for mental health, we would be advised to take in only those ingredients that help dampen our anxiety, weaken our self-hatred, and strengthen our sense of hope. Some of the following are especially to be recommended in a diet for a vulnerable mind.\n\nCamomile tea\n\nWe, the ones forever on the edge of madness, hardly require anything to stimulate us further. We have visions aplenty without the fluorescent colors added by caffeine or alcohol. What we require above all else is something that can slow our racing thoughts and hold us to our most sensible and quiet mental pathways. With a cup full of hot camomile tea, we will be forced to sip slowly, the steam will gently caress our eyelids and we will treat ourselves as who\u2014without any pejorative connotations\u2014we really are: convalescents.\n\nFigs\n\nWe should incline toward foods that have been tampered with as little as possible by the artifice and wiliness of chemists, foods that would have been around in much the same form when the world still had some of its original innocence and quiet. The fig seems to understand sadness and vulnerability. It keeps its appeal muted and it may not be until after we have eaten one that we properly appreciate how nourishing and flavorful it was beneath its serene, unshowy exterior. It urges us to follow it in its attitude of humility and reticence.\n\nNuts\n\nEspecially sympathetic to mental health are handfuls of walnuts and hazelnuts, cashew nuts, and (unsalted) pistachios. They seem to rein in the ambitions that ordinarily torture us. They satisfy us with little and thereby urge us to quieten our restlessness and ignore the chatter and excitement of the public square. They reach a special pitch of sanity-inducing goodness when accompanied by three or four dried apricots.\n\nDates\n\nA good life can\u2019t be free of moments of delight and ecstasy and the date knows this. There has to be room for a degree of excitement. The date delivers ravishment when required, but it is also limited in its power to derail us. It will never render us manic. We could not\u2014even though it can seem as though we might\u2014become addicts of this fruit. It won\u2019t allow us to escape ourselves for too long but it will, for a few moments at least, reorient us toward the light.\n\nFeta cheese, Kalamata olives, and bread\n\nThis should count as a meal for us in moods of mental torment, taking us back to a basic existence and reassuring us that this can be tolerable and wholesome. We don\u2019t need very much to survive. The walls may have closed in and yet pleasure can be drawn from the most apparently insignificant elements. We may lose everything but there will still be this, and alongside it the love and care of a few imaginative and loyal people.\n\nDark chocolate\n\nIt can be as black as the night we fear, but it is\u2014without melodramatic sweetness and with a grown-up understanding sternness\u2014on our side. It leaves behind an almost metallic taste that endows us with courage and resolve without adding guilt or judgment.\n\nIn our ill moods we\u2019re unlikely to have the energy to cook or even think about food, so we can end up highly vulnerable to the blandishments of processed dishes. Yet we should take care that food never becomes yet another reason why we might hate ourselves or regret decisions. We should lean on a few simple menus to carry us across the most difficult, frightened phases of our inner lives.\n\nBATHING\n\nIt is a sign of our lack of civilization that we insist on thinking of baths primarily as tools to clean ourselves with rather than honoring them as what they truly are: instruments of mental health.\n\nThe Romans would have been astonished by our modern plumbing, our ability to summon up a flawless cauldron of piping-hot water at the turn of a tap inside almost every home at negligible cost. Our boilers would have awed them, our pipework would have been the envy of their engineers. These were people who did not consider a country or province properly colonized until public baths had been constructed, who moved mountains and cut through forests to ensure a regular supply of water, who left behind elegant bathing establishments from northern England to the edges of the Sahara desert, from M\u00e9rida in the Iberian West to Palmyra in the Levantine East.\n\nAnd yet it would have puzzled the Romans how silent we are on the deeper resonances of bathing, how few poems and odes there are to our moments in the tub, how unimaginative we tend to be about the powers of hot water to heal our souls.\n\nAll of us have come from warm, watery encasements and, when mental troubles strike, we should immediately head back into the bath to be held, as the womb once did, in a tight aquatic embrace.\n\nHot water is a symbol of love and care. It allows us to let down our guard and, as at so few other moments, to be at once defenseless and safe, naked yet cozy. We can bolt the door, turn down the lights, and allow ourselves to do nothing for a time other than watch the water lap at our knees and occasionally up the temperature with a small scalding infusion.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to force ourselves to arrive at any great conclusions. This is a time to idle and free-associate. We can let the mind wander, perhaps backward to more innocent days or to the moment when the troubles began. We can float over our lives without our usual critical inclinations. We can drown our pain in the heat, cauterize our mental wounds, and let our tears lose themselves in the steam.\n\nWe may want to keep a small towel and a pad of paper and a pencil by the bath, in case something strikes us that could put a better spin on our travails. Or we can simply float and wait for some of the panic to subside, as it surely will.\n\nThose of us who suffer in our minds should not be embarrassed to have as many as three baths a day, each one lasting up to an hour. They will be the enamel ships that carry us over the worst of our griefs.\n\nEXERCISE\n\nOne of the great impediments to taking exercise is the idea that being unwilling to do so must be caused first and foremost by something called \u201claziness.\u201d The reason why we are sitting on the couch a lot, or are spending a considerable time in bed, or are seriously reluctant to run is that we are, in essence, bone idle.\n\nBut we must get to the root of what is really going on with the mentally unwell. They don\u2019t sit around because they are lazy but because they are ill, and it\u2019s a specific feature of mental illness that you may be especially hampered when it comes to the matter of moving your body with any degree of vigor.\n\nOne might say that mental illness makes one retreat\u2014from the world in general, its trees, its people, its sagas and concerns and joys. But it also makes us retreat from our own body, from its limbs, its skin, and its right to be. One might say that illness squats at the front of consciousness in pain and is reluctant to let anything carefree or mobile or fluid get through.\n\nMany varieties of mental illness freeze us, not with fear necessarily, though that too, but with self-hatred, shame, anxiety, and regret. With such moods coursing through us, we are in no position to stretch, to run, or to gambol. We are rooted to our spot, a place of sadness, misery, and dread.\n\nWe know all the arguments in favor of exercise\u2014they are incontestable. Our limbs need to move, our lungs need rapid oxygenation, our skin needs to sweat vigorously. But when we are ill these arguments end up feeling punitive and accusatory. They remind us of all that we are incapable of, of how badly we have failed and of how awful we are.\n\nTo have any chance of exercising, we need a different, more forgiving approach, one built first on a lot of modesty. Because we are ill we can\u2019t be an athlete, certainly not for now. So by \u201cexercise\u201d we mean something far gentler than might ideally be recommended. The only exercise we are capable of will be mild in the extreme\u2014realistically, we are talking about going for a walk and not much more. This doesn\u2019t sound like any sort of feat, but nor do many of the achievements of those who are in recovery. They become heroic only once we know what the individual had to go through to pull them off.\n\nThe walk might be only once or twice around the block, but it will still be extremely valuable, especially if it\u2019s repeated every day. In many forms of mental illness, such is our degree of shame we don\u2019t feel we have permission to leave the house. We feel it is illegitimate to be outside \u201cenjoying\u201d ourselves, worried that we will be seen and negatively judged. We want to hide because we feel like a monster in the eyes of others. So it\u2019s an enormous feat to put on a coat and, against all our instincts, wander out as though the world could be a habitable, welcoming, and safe place.\n\nYet how salutary it can be to take the risk, because there is healing to be found in the sight of the trees on the horizon, the starlings in a hedge, a duck by the meadow, a dog next to the supermarket. What we are seeing is soothing evidence that the world exists beyond our own cruel, mean-spirited ill minds. There is so much that knows nothing of us, that is gloriously indifferent\u2014those stars appearing in the dusk sky\u2014and that isn\u2019t there to shame us. We slowly reinhabit our bodies. Outside seems so much more normal than what is inside our heads and we can take inspiration: Someone is moving house, a child is playing with a stick, there is a cat on a wall resting in the sun. Things may not be as awful as we had assumed when it was just us in the bedroom, going through the narrow, dark corridors of memory. We can feel our feet taking slightly longer steps, our lungs working a little harder. We have walked once around the block already and no one has attacked us, no one has mocked us, no one is laughing. We are doing extremely well.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t push it. Exercise can be very minor and still wholly beneficial. We aren\u2019t going to be marathon runners, but we have managed something extraordinary nonetheless. We\u2019re athletes of a different sort, tackling a different enemy, and our battle is already well under way.\n\nSILENCE\n\nThe news media serves two essential constituencies: people who are running nations and businesses; and people whose lives are a little too quiet, a little too undramatic, and a little too serene for their own tastes.\n\nThese two broad categories are unlikely to comprise anyone who self-identifies as mentally unwell. The last thing that we need when things are going awry in our minds is yet more evidence of folly, melodrama, chaos, aggression, partisanship, and an absence of forgiveness. We owe it to ourselves to become willingly more ignorant of what is going on in our highly disturbed and disturbing media.\n\nThe minds of the mentally ill are already engaged in titanic struggles and battles. While there may be no outward movement, inside heroic efforts will be taking place to answer back against the monsters of self-hatred and to hold the door against the hounds of self-contempt. They will be facing floodwaters of anxiety that try to sweep away every last hope in their path, crushing like toys elements placed in their way, like plans and affiliations and a sense of identity. If we could hear this struggle it would have some of the melodrama of a Wagner opera; and if we could see it it would have the turbulent quality of a Turner painting. Someone could be sitting down on the couch, looking sad, occasionally putting a finger to their lips, while inside their benighted mind scenes might be unfolding akin to Valley of Aosta: Snowstorm, Avalanche, and Thunderstorm set to the sound of \u201cRide of the Valkyries.\u201d\n\nJ. M. W. Turner, Valley of Aosta: Snowstorm, Avalanche, and Thunderstorm, 1836\u20137.\n\nIn the circumstances, we don\u2019t need to have our nerve endings further shocked or titillated. What we urgently need, and may die without, is quiet. Despite the pressure to \u201cstay informed\u201d and know \u201cwhat is going on,\u201d our real responsibilities lie elsewhere: in not knowing a great many things in order to keep faith with life itself. We will have our hands full reviewing our past, battling despair, and hanging on to reasons why it might be worth surviving until next summer. This leaves no time to be curious about the parliamentary elections or the latest dilemmas facing an actor and her partner. The apparently innocent activity of reading the headlines now counts as a hugely reckless act.\n\nWe should tell those who love us and are living in our vicinity to help us direct our minds toward hope and kindness. We should beg them to switch off all media and not bring any papers into the house. Let them not refer to anything that hasn\u2019t been around for 200 years at least. We should focus on eternal verities and on small sympathetic, generous ideas nearer to home.\n\nWe need serenity in which to challenge our beliefs that we are awful, that the worst will happen to us and that we won\u2019t be able to survive. We need calm in which to rebuild faith in ourselves and in existence more broadly. To assist us, we need interiors like those depicted in the works of the great Danish master of stillness Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, rooms in which the sun washes on to clean, empty surfaces and all that can be heard in the distance might be the sounds of a child playing in the yard or some pigeons on the roof opposite. We don\u2019t need any further arguments in favor of chaos and nastiness. We have enough of this in our heads for twelve lifetimes. We don\u2019t need to titillate ourselves with the thought that the world might boil or be rocked by a nuclear accident or that a new disease might ravage us. Let someone else keep an eye on the bigger picture, calling us only when the crisis is at the door; for now, leave us to fight our inner world-shaking struggles in a corner of a quiet, sunlit room.\n\nVilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, Interior in Strandgade, Sunlight on the Floor, 1901.",

      "content": "## HOUSEHOLD TASKS\n\nA traditional approach to mental healing stresses the need to face up to our demons\u2014at all times and with full courage. The underlying idea is that we fall ill when we attempt to back away from certain painful but necessary truths about our inner lives: that we are in a very unhappy relationship, that we were traumatized in childhood, that we are addicted to a substance, or have not dared to do justice to our sexuality. We will only get well, so the theory goes, once we cease to crowd out our own reality; the glare of honesty will save us.\n\nBut while we can amply recognize the toll of certain forms of denial, we can still make a nuanced case for the other side, for the occasional need\u2014especially when we are very unwell\u2014to take some time off from self-analysis. We should do so not in a spirit of escape but rather from a feeling of consciously giving ourselves a few hours away from our problems so that we can return to them with renewed creativity and strength. Distraction intelligently handled can be a part of mental healing.\n\nWe might therefore want to recommend that the mentally fragile make soup or freeze batches of pasta sauces; weed the garden and seed flowers for the spring; scour the internet for new kinds of peripherals for the computer; ensure that the stairs are spotless and the windows free of all finger marks; or invest in a strange kind of sanding machine with which to finally sort out the door that doesn\u2019t close properly.\n\nOf course it\u2019s important to talk about key figures of childhood and try to trace the origins of our fears of disgrace. But it could be equally important at other moments to run away from the incessant pain inside us by making fishcakes or raking the garden.\n\nSmall household tasks offer us a metaphor for the sort of fixing we\u2019re interested in but can\u2019t yet quite manage inside ourselves. They give us the courage to imagine a day when we might be as tidy inside our minds as the linen cupboard outside currently is\u2014thanks to what we did all afternoon.\n\nThere is kindness in making sure a mentally unwell person has a few untaxing duties to take care of every day. Monasteries understood the unruliness of the mind and the kindly role of chores in assuaging it. They allowed the monks to think head on of God and their responsibilities within a spiritual life for many hours at a time. But they also gave them moments to think of something that was simpler and more exhausting. Hence the emphasis on working in the vegetable garden and the kitchen, the laundry room, and the pantry.\n\nIt can be the height of generosity to ask someone who isn\u2019t well to help us change the sheets and prune the artichokes. It won\u2019t be work; it is in reality a minor vacation from the exhausting labors that must soon resume within.",

      "content": "## MENTAL CONVALESCENCE\n\nIt\u2019s one of the benefits of most physical illnesses that they are immediately observable and hence command a ready degree of respect and kindness from those around us. We know to prop a pillow beneath the person with a broken arm, we immediately open the door to someone on crutches.\n\nBut without anyone meaning to be thoughtless, it is harder to keep this caring attitude in mind when dealing with a mentally unwell person. As sufferers, we may ourselves forget our condition, launching into tasks and situations for which we are not ready and which will undermine our efforts at recovery.\n\nTo get well, we need to recognize fully that we are ill and therefore that we must endure a period, which could be very lengthy indeed, of convalescence. This will mean rigidly patrolled and regulated routines, an absence of stimulation, a huge emphasis on rest, and a close monitoring of visitors. We should be as careful with ourselves as we might be if we were recovering from a cancer or lung operation. We may have no physical scars but we should do ourselves the kindness of accepting\u2014simply based on our symptoms\u2014that we are as sick as those in intensive care wards or those for whom sirens wail across the city at night.\n\nWe need to be selfish about the state of our spirits and ruthless in removing ourselves from situations that sap us. We should go to bed early, eat lightly, bathe often, go for a walk every day, have something pleasant to distract us, and, most of all, be kind to ourselves because of the mess we are in.\n\nWe should learn from physical rehabilitation how long it will probably take to feel well again. Recovery from a broken wrist might take six months; it can be a year before a new hip is fully functioning once more. A mind that\u2019s broken can take longer still; it could be one or two years, even four or five. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The mind is a far more complex organ than any bone or muscle and so warrants a correspondingly lengthy period of recuperation. Nor, as with other injuries, should we expect progress to be linear. There will be many days when we go sharply backward, when we\u2019re catapulted back into the sort of despair we had hoped to leave behind for ever. We should not be discouraged, though. What matters is the overall trend as measured across months, not a bad day here or there. There will be periods of darkness just when we had started to hope once more and we should greet them without panic.\n\nWe have become experts over many years in a distinct language, a language of illness and self-torture. It will take a great deal of time to unlearn it and become fluent in the language of generosity and self-compassion.\n\nWe may not be living in an institution, but we should proceed with as much care and seriousness as if we were. We should construct hospitals for the mind within our own homes and educate those around us about our needs. We will gradually grow well again as we learn to lead the peaceful, warm-hearted, kindly, and well-regulated lives that our minds have craved for so long.\n\n11 Work\n\nEven without knowing the specifics, we can hazard that work\u2014somewhere along the line\u2014will have heavily contributed to our falling mentally ill. But at the same time, we can suggest that work, if correctly rethought and reconfigured, may play a central role in our recovery. We should learn to handle this double-edged sword with particular care.",

It is the favored tool of all those who start in life with a feeling of being under-loved, under-appreciated, and overlooked. It is the instrument of vengeance of the once-ignored. Under the guise of a merely practical pursuit, it carries a heavy emotional mission: it is the means by which we try to earn our right to be.\n\nIt may for a while seem to fulfill this purpose very well. Success can earn us preferment, a higher income, honor and fame, which can assuage our underlying sense that we are undeserving and shameful.\n\nBut the healing is only ever cosmetic, temporary, and subject to constant reversals. All success necessarily brings with it envy and criticism. The moment we have achieved a prominent position, dissenting voices will emerge to claim that we are illegitimate and unworthy, and thereby remind us of precisely the negative self-image we are pedaling so hard to outrun. We\u2019ll be torn between listening to praise and focusing on the thread of denunciation\u2014and the latter will be the only one that mesmerizes us.\n\nNo amount of success will be able to expunge our inner sense of baseness and unlovability. We may work monstrously hard, not because our material needs are so elevated but because we are only ever a few steps ahead of a chorus of inner voices telling us that we are futile and ludicrous.\n\nOver time, we will fall prey to exhaustion. The source of our tiredness won\u2019t be the work itself, it\u2019ll be the constant effort to keep at bay a confrontation with our original lack of self-love. It\u2019ll simply be too tiring to spend a whole life insisting through our labors that we are not bad people.",

We will be failing in certain eyes of course, we will be letting down a lot of people and dashing the hopes of those who need us to perform in a certain way.\n\nBut if accompanied by the right sort of care, a breakdown can allow us to review the role that work was playing in our lives and to cease using it as compensation for an emotional wound. We can see that the real tragedy isn\u2019t that we messed up our impressive careers but that we so badly needed to have them in the first place in order to make up for early and unexplored deprivation.\n\nOur failure may have stripped us of chances to impress in the worldly sense. At a stroke, though, we\u2019ll be liberated from those false friends and colleagues who pegged their attention to our money and status. And all we will have to fall back on are those who understand love and are willing to be concerned with us not because of anything we can do for them, but simply because we are alive. This may be the first time we have ever witnessed such unconditionality\u2014and it will correct a lingering misapprehension that we can only earn care through performance.\n\nThe breakdown will offer us a path toward a more authentic way of living, where who we really are, shorn of our trappings, can feel acceptable. The failure we always dreaded would happen has unfolded and we are liberated, no longer having to worry about it as a feared spectre.\n\nIn the ruins, we may be able to ask ourselves new questions: What do I actually want to do? Whose opinion do I really care about? We\u2019ll have slain the dragon of prestige and may now be ready to live on our own terms for the first time.",

We should be unbothered by fears of failing, for this is a seam we have now fully explored.

      "content": "## SMALL IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMuch work seeks to have an impact on a large scale over an extended time period, involving hundreds and perhaps millions of players.\n\nGiven our fragility, we might be counseled away from vast and complex efforts. We need tasks that can leave us feeling, at the end of every day, as if we have made a small but notable difference in someone else\u2019s life. Perhaps we have in a modest way improved their command of a language, or cleaned up their garden, or given them something nourishing to eat. We may not have pushed the boundaries of knowledge or be remembered in a thousand years, but we\u2019ll have done something more substantial still: kept ourselves steady against enormous odds and made an honest contribution to the welfare of a few ailing fellow humans.\n\n12 Pessimism\n\nIt may be hard to imagine that the word \u201cpessimism\u201d could have any role to play in mitigating the effects of mental illness. But that would be to underestimate the covert persecutory aspects of its opposite, optimism. The expectation that our life should be well, that we should be forever free of anxiety and despair, paranoia and loneliness, is both understandable in its ambition and confidence and yet quietly tormenting.\n\nThose of us who have been visited by severe mental illness need to cling to darker counsel. We, members of a not insubstantial minority, have been stricken by a fragility that will not lightly ever leave us alone again and so we need to be ready henceforth always to greet life with particular care: grateful for whichever days go well, serene in the face of those that don\u2019t, appreciative of the small gains we are capable of, and permanently vigilant as to the possibility of relapse. We have been denied the easy-going lives we would have loved to lead and should not add insult to injury by continuing to regret them. They should be mourned rather than lamented.\n\nWe should accept with grace that things are, naturally, not as we would wish them to be. We will have to hobble when we would have loved to gambol freely. We\u2019ll need to be creative about exploring how life could be bearable in circumstances far less rosy than anyone would have wished. We will have to give up our pride: that is, our assurance in our own competence and automatic right to dignity. We have been humbled and ridiculed by our own minds.\n\nAt the same time, we should take steps to make ourselves at home in the darkness. We should willingly expose our reason to our worst, nastiest, and most invalid thoughts rather than let them steal up on us at a time of their choosing. We should practice thought exercises that strip our fears of their unexamined hold on us.\n\nThe anxious should defiantly accept that they can never eradicate certain risks but that these can be shouldered\u2014and a habitable life made among the ruins. Our relationships may never go right, certain family members will always resent us, particular enemies will never come over to our side, we cannot correct mistakes in our career, there will invariably be doubters and outright sadists. But none of this should surprise us and we should not let undue innocence aggravate our mood. We should explore the unbudgeable sadness on sunny mornings, when our reasoning faculties are lively and calming, instead of letting matters unnerve us in 3 a.m. confrontations when we are too groggy and worn down to know what to answer our demons.\n\nWe should heed the fact that it has already been very bad and, if it were to be so again, we would cope as we have already done. We should take comfort from the thought that we have suffered what some would consider to be the worst scenario\u2014we have actually gone \u201cmad\u201d\u2014and yet we are still here, more or less coherent, still able to enjoy one or two things, still capable of gratitude and occasional appreciation. We should, simply on the basis of what we have survived, not be very scared of anything much at all again.\n\nWe must accept with grim cheer that it wasn\u2019t to be our fate to belong to the mentally robust cohort. When the angels were distributing brains in the upper atmosphere, we were accorded one of the more sensitive, erratic, brilliant, tumultuous ones, which we will have to continue to watch like anxious nurses for the first signs of fracture till the day we die.\n\nBut the troubles we feel so personally are not in reality ours alone. We are a community of the ailing and the more we can discover and connect with its other fascinating, consoling members, the less our troubles will weigh on us as singular punishments. The mood of society as a whole may tend remorselessly toward cheeriness. We have access to a dark cheerfulness of our own, shared among fellow sufferers, who are equally resolute in meeting a fate they never asked for, do not deserve, but refuse to be cowed by.\n\n13 Skepticism\n\nFew things come more naturally to us than trust in our own minds: their first impressions, the feelings they summon up for us, their judgments about people and situations, their assessments of who we are, what we are worth and what the future may be like for us. It feels right and normal that we should accept, without hesitation or compunction, whatever response our minds put forward to our consciousness. Why would we go to the trouble and tedium of starting to doubt what we innately and automatically think and feel? We must surely be able to trust our very own thinking machines.\n\nYet at the core of recovery from mental illness is the continually bewildering realization that our minds are, at key moments, objectively extremely unreliable and illogical. And, to compound the problem, they give us no sign at all that they might be any such things. They insist on their reasonableness even while they are behaving in what we can only much later deduce, with great patience and effort, is a foolish, harmful, or demented way. We have a grave enemy and deceiver right between our ears.\n\nFor example, these minds will tell us with total sincerity that the future holds something entirely awful for us and will thereby ruin decades of our lives in paranoid obsessions and compulsive rituals. They will tell us with supreme confidence that we face grave danger by doing something that actually doesn\u2019t imperil us at all, and might even bring us a chance to flourish. They will encourage us to sabotage relationships filled with love and possibility, driving willing partners from our arms. They will tell us to give up on hugely promising work projects for fear we\u2019ll annoy someone and will inform us that there is grave danger in building up faith in ourselves.\n\nOur brains cannot think straight because they are reasoning via experiences in the past that were anomalous, unfair, unrepresentative, and unreliable. These brains claim to know that we are useless because that is how we happened to be viewed by one or two caregivers when we were very small and our neural networks were being laid down. They have complete assurance that achieving success will be dangerous for us because it once was, for a little while, around a jealous and inadequate relative who died many years ago. These brains keep sabotaging our relationships because of one relationship that hurt us immensely when we were too young to know how to defend ourselves. Or they keep us in a subservient position vis-\u00e0-vis someone in the present because this was once the safest way to be, when we were under five.\n\nOur flawed brains are fateful generalizers from their earliest moments. They take the raw material of our young lives and extrapolate universal theories from it which can destroy our chances of responding adequately to the diverse and novel conditions of adult reality.\n\nRecovering mental health depends on doing something utterly counter-intuitive: doubting our first thoughts on pretty much all topics through an appreciation of our innate biases, how they are structured and where they come from. We should put a large distance between ourselves and any impulse that washes over us. Strong feelings\u2014that we have found our ideal life partner after ten minutes, that we must leave a person immediately, that we are about to be destroyed, that everyone hates us, that disaster is upon us\u2014should invariably be resisted, placed in a safe zone and inspected with the utmost rigor, calm, and skepticism. We should develop an ingrained suspicion of our greatest, most spontaneous certainties, asking a whole series of questions of them: Is it really true that they told me they hate me? Did they actually say they wanted to end the relationship? Is there real evidence that everything is over?\n\nIt\u2019s a curious way to live, and a humbling one too, to have to pass our certainties through a constantly skeptical sieve and to demand that we sleep on conclusions and discuss them with a reliable friend before acting on them.\n\nAt given moments, especially when we are tired, we should realize that we are not capable of thinking correctly and should therefore stop thinking altogether rather than mangle our conclusions any further. We should hold on to the idea that when we are especially distressed and upset, we will have lost our hold on the fragile thread of reason.\n\nThere will be certain ideas that enter consciousness with which, politely, we should just refuse to engage\u2014because we have done so too many times before and know they are futile and disconnected from anything real. There really is no point in thinking, for the millionth time, about how ugly we are, how bad we are, how guilty we are. These aren\u2019t thoughts that have anything sensible to tell us about our lives today. With due respect to our minds, we\u2019d be better off putting on some music, counting to a hundred or calling up a friend.\n\nWe\u2019ll be on the road to recovery and sanity when we see that one way to be properly reasonable is to appreciate how much of the time we aren\u2019t able to be so. We aren\u2019t disrespecting ourselves; we\u2019re properly honoring our complex histories and the congenitally flawed thinking patterns they have unwittingly led us to.",

      "content": "## II : Love\n\nCentral to the process of overcoming mental turmoil is learning more about what love really is, so that we can detect its absence in the way we treat ourselves and start to nurture and honor its presence in those we decide to be close to.\n\nWe are often sold a fundamentally and unhelpfully romantic view of love, which proposes that love is the reward given to a person for their strengths: it is what someone can expect to receive when they are supremely beautiful, rich, impressive, or popular. The most lovable person on earth is\u2014according to this philosophy\u2014simultaneously the most gifted and consummate one.\n\nBut there is another, broader, nobler conception that understands love not as a reward for strength but as a sympathy for, and commitment to attending to, weakness. Love is what we feel when we see a small baby, helpless before the world, reaching out for our finger, clasping it tight and pulling a frail and grateful smile. Love is what we register when our partner, usually composed and competent, comes to us with apology and confusion, begging for our help.\n\nHowever impressed we may be by beauty and flawless achievement, what we should truly love is vulnerability. We begin to love, rather than merely admire, when others no longer have to exhibit perfection to seem worthy. Simultaneously, the people we should put our faith in are those who do not recoil from us in our frightened or hesitant moments, those who don\u2019t just want to clap at us and be awed by our triumphs. They are those who can be moved by our crises, who are on hand in the dark hours, who will still be around when the rest of the world is jeering.\n\nSimilarly, the properly self-loving person isn\u2019t the one who congratulates themselves when they have pulled off an astonishing feat; it\u2019s the one who knows how to speak to themselves in a kind voice when everything has gone wrong, who can remain kind in the face of ill fortune, who doesn\u2019t have to berate or criticize themselves without mercy. We should feel proud of having attained a capacity for such love. It isn\u2019t weakness or charity; it is an achievement founded on the most dignified understanding of what we must do to accede to our full humanity.\n\nWe will have finally learned to love ourselves and others when fragility and imperfection touch us and incite our desire to assist, to understand, and to console.\n\n1 Learning to Love\n\nTo begin with the love of others . . . A melancholy paradox lies at the heart of modern relationships: We know that to thrive emotionally must involve love, but on the ground contented unions are dauntingly rare. It is tempting to believe that those for whom love works out have been granted a form of divine favor. But we cannot build a decent life on the hope of randomly distributed heavenly munificence.\n\nThere is no need for superstition or despair. Good relationships are neither mysterious nor random. There are solid, rationally structured explanations for why some people do well together while others, despite powerful initial hopes and touchingly idealistic intentions, do not. Success seems random simply because we have to date operated with an insufficiently firm grip on the actual mechanics of true love.\n\nThere are, in reality, only a small number of fundamental factors that account for the well-being of every robust, loving couple. Though relationships might seem infinitely varied, whether they succeed or fail comes down, in essence, to the presence\u2014or absence\u2014of five anchors.\n\n(I) NON-DEFENSIVENESS\n\nHowever sweet and fascinating two people might initially be, it is inescapable that they will also with time, and the birth of true intimacy, stumble upon aspects of one another\u2019s characters that cannot help but generate difficulties and a degree of dismay. Each partner could be determined to be only kind, but the way that they shell an egg, leave the bathroom, deal with their suitcase on returning from a trip, handle the household keys, or tell an anecdote will gradually unleash powerful degrees of frustration or puzzlement in those they must share their lives with.\n\nOne of the most basic features of our natures is that we are defensive. That is, we seek to ward off psychic pain and defend ourselves against perceived attacks. Our minds are squeamish. We try to uphold a bearable picture of ourselves in the face of any possible insights or criticisms that others may direct toward\u2014us or that could emanate from the more perceptive recesses of our own minds. We are not keen on feedback. Our defensiveness is a profoundly understandable tendency, yet it is also behind a predominant share of the failure of all relationships.\n\nThe problem starts when we, as partners, venture to air what we have noticed. We might start out politely and tentatively, gently mentioning the strands of hair in the basin or the muddled telling of anecdotes in front of strangers. But thoughtful receptivity can be hard to come by. Our partner is in danger of treating our remarks as if they were a direct attack, as something no sound adult could ever really be bothered by; they might go strangely quiet or immediately accuse us of being hugely unkind or malevolently judgmental. Or they might slyly turn the tables and start listing\u2014with less and less good humor\u2014certain things that they find awful about us and that they have been holding on to privately for a long time. Whatever strategy they adopt, the underlying meaning tends to be the same: that being found in some way imperfect is entirely unacceptable and deeply contrary to the spirit of true love.\n\n\u201cLove me for who I am\u201d is the fateful rallying cry of all lovers headed for disaster. It is in reality a monstrously unfair\u2014though entirely understandable\u2014demand to be loved just as we are, with our panoply of faults, compulsions, neuroses, and immaturities. But with a modicum of self-awareness and honesty, we should only ever expect to be loved for who we hope to be, for who we are at our best moments, for the good that lies in us in a latent and not-yet-realized state.\n\nThe spirit of true love should require that whenever there is feedback, we turn gratefully to our partner and ask for more, that we continuously search to access a better version of ourselves, that we see love as a classroom in which our lover can teach us one or two things about who we should become\u2014rather than as a burrow in which our existing errors can be sentimentally endorsed and encouraged.\n\nIn order to overcome defensiveness, we need to understand its sources; we have to think about defensiveness not in its obdurate, dismaying present manifestations but in its greatly more benevolent and engaging origins. Defensiveness is almost invariably founded on an intimate history that no defensive person consciously chose and that, compassionately recounted, might move us to tears. Defensiveness is a legacy of early pain. There might have been a shy six-year-old with a robust, confident parent who was ashamed of their timid, lonely child. No one much seemed to care for this soft-cheeked, large-eyed creature at home. There were criticisms and hints that another sibling was favored. Love, as this poor soul encountered it, was a scarce, easily lost commodity. For anything to be pointed out to them was, as they came to think, a harbinger of fresh contempt and renewed exclusion from everything sustaining and kind. Or else a parent was intermittently admiring and then terrifyingly angry at their offspring if there was the slightest drop in performance at school. Defensive people did not magically acquire their ferocity in relation to our comments, but rather suffered from some form of early neglect or encounter with unsteady, fluctuating warmth. No wonder that such a person might respond with alarm, even viciousness, when the slightest negative thought about them rears its head in a lover they felt ready to entrust with their whole being. There could, in the mind of the unfortunate sufferer, plainly be no such thing as affectionate criticism, no such thing as helpful feedback, no possibility of being at once adored and upbraided. Love cannot be conceived of as coexisting alongside occasional moments of evaluation. It is on the basis of such awkward, emotionally scarred internal associations that defensiveness is built.\n\nA less-defended attitude isn\u2019t a random gift; it is something we can aim for every bit as much as we can aim for a flatter stomach or a tidier house. Even if we didn\u2019t have an ideal introduction to life, we can access ideas that dismantle the equation between love-worthiness and untouchable perfection. We can begin to become less defensive when we take some of the following on board.\n\nOur early experience isn\u2019t a guide to the present\n\nOur defenses were the best we could do in the face of early harshness. We were confronted with problems and demands far beyond our strength. But a decent partner, if we let them know our background troubles, will be moved by our tender desperation and hasty fear. And they can, so long as we master our panic, help us to see that the thing we should be afraid of now is not criticism but an inability to accept its occasional kindly manifestations.\n\nBy the background standard of the defensive person, no one could ever be loved\n\nIf love really required an absence of even the most minor flaws, no one could possibly qualify for a relationship. Yet in reality, we are love-worthy not because we are perfect, but because none of us ever can be.\n\nIrritation isn\u2019t objective\n\nWe need not feel overly targeted by criticism. Every partner has their own particular fixations and preoccupations that make them latch on to certain features of another\u2019s character. That a partner is annoyed with us over something is no sign that we are doing anything appalling per se, so we can afford to feel unpersecuted by their judgment. Some people wouldn\u2019t mind a messy cupboard; not everyone cares about a lengthy anecdote. An issue can be worth discussing amicably not because it is a fundamental failing but simply because it happens to bother someone we love.\n\nLove isn\u2019t fragile\n\nIn the defensive person\u2019s mind, the least comment is like the small rockfall that announces an avalanche. There seems no way to trust that it really is just about how long pasta should be cooked or the right way to make a bed. The underlying intention seems always to be to inflict a devastating wound and speed the entire relationship to a close. The defensive person has not had a chance to experience the robustness of love\u2014how it is possible to call someone the worst names in the lexicon and then, ten minutes later, want to lie softly in their arms, tenderness having been renewed and reinvigorated by an opportunity to purge frustration. There can be ruptures\u2014and repair. True love is resilient. It is not destroyed by a detail but only ever by the way that a detail can\u2019t be acknowledged or processed.\n\nDefensiveness can be outgrown. We can learn to measure in our hearts the difference between a complaint and an existential rejection. We can come to hear a criticism without connecting it to damnation. That love once seemed fragile doesn\u2019t mean it must be today. We can trust that we may on occasion irritate a partner without concluding that they will for that matter hate everything about us unto eternity.\n\nWhen searching for a partner, we need to look out for someone who can join us in the noble quest to recognize and overcome defensiveness. We might even raise this ambition on an early date\u2014\u201cI\u2019d like one day to move to the country, learn Spanish and, with a lover\u2019s help, get over my defensiveness,\u201d we might declare by way of introducing our goals. We could frame the attempt to listen to criticism without fury or hurt as belonging to one of life\u2019s mightiest challenges\u2014alongside sporting excellence or business success. Eventually, with a lot of effort, we would hope to reach the stage when a partner could point out with tact and humanity that we had bad breath or that our shoes didn\u2019t match our sweater and, rather than reacting as we have grown up to do, we could simply turn to them, smile benignly and say what flawed humans should always respond with when another member of the species deigns to help them to grow into a better version of themselves: Thank you.\n\n(II) VULNERABILITY\n\nThere\u2019s a second criterion crucial for relationship success: The person who is good at love is good at being vulnerable.\n\nWe make ourselves psychologically vulnerable whenever we let a partner know some of the ways in which we are weak, needy, scared, immature, incompetent, or just plain odd\u2014that is, some of the ways in which we are human. To be vulnerable is to dare to take off the usual cloak of normality and sensibleness with which we navigate the world and, for once, to show someone who we really are, with all the fragility and unusualness implied. We might, as vulnerable people, admit to having unsteady minds; to being prone to terror, despair, paranoia, and self-hatred.\n\nIt\u2019s a hugely complicated step to confess\u2014especially in front of someone we fundamentally want to impress and secure the affection of that there are basic ways in which we fall short of what a sane adult is meant to be like. A certain kind of no-nonsense partner might well tell us sternly to grow up, complain about us to their friends and make hasty moves to end the relationship.\n\nAs a result, we often lie, not for advantage or thievery, but in order to keep hold of a love we desperately want to rely on. We pretend to be strong and unafraid. We disown our needs and longings. We put on a show of being someone else. Such acting works in many contexts. An uncomplaining, breezy competence and unemotive intelligence probably make for an ideal employee, an admirable committee member, and a thoroughly respectable citizen of the modern world. But in an intimate relationship, this form of barricaded caution is fatal. Our fears and inadequacies don\u2019t vanish because we have hidden them; we don\u2019t get any less childlike or odd because we have learned to appear sensible. We simply end up making it impossible for a partner to know us\u2014and, because they are likely to take their lead from our own reserve, they will be unable to show themselves to us in turn. We enclose ourselves in the high walls of our deceptions.\n\nTo dare to be vulnerable involves a faith that whatever we are inwardly most afraid and ashamed of in our own natures must have counterparts in other people. We cannot be alone in our oddities and our symptoms. The only people we can assume are \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201csane\u201d are those we don\u2019t yet know very well. But once we are past the flawless exterior, every person we meet\u2014and especially the person we are now dating\u2014will have their share of follies and tender spots: they will be unable to temper their panic, they will fear disgrace, they won\u2019t remember how to soothe themselves. We are guaranteed not to be alone in our terrors and neediness. And what is more, it\u2019s only on the basis of mutual disclosure of susceptibility that a true bond can be built. We may admire paragons of strength and stoicism; we can never properly love them.\n\nTo be vulnerable is in essence to let a partner catch sight of a side of us that dates back to childhood: the distant time when we feared Mommy would never come back, when we cried and no one comforted us, when Daddy shouted at us and we were frozen with dismay, when a rough friend told us we were a baby for still loving our stuffed elephant, when no one wanted to play with us in the playground, when we tried and tried to explain but Granny was still angry. To be properly, fully vulnerable is to take the other into the frightened, small places of our past and let them see that we\u2019re still in significant ways the little, distressed people we once were. Honest, vibrant love is an encounter between two vulnerable children who otherwise do a very good job of masquerading as adults.\n\nWhat makes people reject the offer of vulnerability? The strength they insist on displaying to the world is an indicator of how punishing they have had to be toward their fragile inner selves; it\u2019s a measure of how fast they have had to grow up. If Mommy dismissed their night-time fears they will have had to try to tell themselves desperately that Mommy was right and that crybabies really are disgusting. They perhaps deflected the rough boys\u2019 taunting of Minko, who had been knitted by Granny while they were still in the womb and whose trunk had half disintegrated under the intensity of their hugs, by throwing the little soft toy in the bin. They managed their traumas by siding with those who had hurt them. They focused on keeping their room tidy, passing exams, and learning how to do business. And so they came to fear the very thing that they now most need: an enfolding, restorative, and profoundly understanding tenderness toward their traumatized early selves. In a grim paradox, to have words of empathy whispered to them lovingly in the dark only reinforces their deepest fears; their protective shell snaps ever more tightly shut at the approach of sympathetic love; they respond to their own needs with panic and self-disgust.\n\nWe learn to be vulnerable by understanding that those who conveyed the imperative of a tougher\u2014non-crying, non-fragile, loving\u2014self were profoundly incorrect and, in their own way, deeply traumatized. Mommy was dismissive of our fears not because she was impressively astute in her theories of human development but because she was struggling with her own history of unattended need. The anti-Minko \u201cfriend\u201d wasn\u2019t showing us the real path to being a grown-up but inflicting on us some of the unkindness that had in other contexts been directed at them. We need to go back and convince ourselves\u2014perhaps with a touch of anger\u2014of how misguided the agents of our \u201cgrowing up\u201d really were.\n\nFinding a partner with whom we can be vulnerable constitutes a supreme act of restoration. After a lifetime of denial and false strength, we stand to find in another the sympathy that was sorely needed but unavailable to us in the past. The old wounds can be gently tended; we become stronger by learning to speak the language of weakness. By letting our hurt, mentally fragile selves into the relationship, we open the way to a more nuanced, fruitful, creative, and accurate way of being an adult.\n\n(III) TENDERNESS\n\nLove has a third important but not always easily recognized ingredient: tenderness. Tenderness often gets overlooked because what it really involves is compassion at the very moment when compassion isn\u2019t obviously deserved. Relationships succeed when it is precisely a partner\u2019s less edifying and unworthy behaviors that remain capable of arousing, alongside a deep sigh, doses of unearned redemptive empathy.\n\nIn theory, we all have plenty of time for compassion, but we tend to have some specific notions of where and when this quality should really be deployed. We typically reserve it for the most obviously blameless candidates: those who are sad but entirely good, those who have lost their livelihoods through no fault of their own, those who were born into unfortunate circumstances, struck by lightning or rendered homeless by earthquakes.\n\nWhat we find much harder to do is to forgive someone who appears to be behaving suboptimally on purpose, who seems to have made an active choice to mess things up, who looks as if they have taken a negative path out of wilfulness, idiocy, or nastiness; someone who had options to be successful or respectable, calm or grown up, but instead\u2014for reasons we have no energy to investigate\u2014decided to shout, to be mean, to respond ungratefully or to display immaturity. We know we are kind people, but we surely cannot be expected to love where love is undeserved.\n\nAnd yet that is exactly where love should and must be deployed if relationships are to survive. True love cannot be directed solely toward those who are admirable and virtuous. It has to soften our judgments in relation to people who are at points undeniably maddening and plainly wrong.\n\nA way to conceive of love is as a willingness to look beyond the obvious damning grounds for bad behavior in search of deeper, more forgivable reasons why someone messed up. We see this most clearly in the way that a good-enough parent loves a child. When a three-year-old throws a tantrum and pushes their dinner plate on the floor, scattering pasta everywhere, a parent knows not to slap their offspring and declare them \u201cevil.\u201d The parent will search for reasons why their child acted as they did. Perhaps they have sore gums. Maybe they are extremely tired. Perhaps their rivalrous feelings toward a sibling have reached a pitch. The parent searches for something other than sheer \u201cbadness\u201d to explain a departure from good sense and decorum.\n\nA little of this curiosity and empathy should, with caveats and boundaries, enter our adult relationships as well. Here, too, there will be plenty of occasions when we cannot easily imagine why our partner acted as they did: their moodiness seems to have no rationale; there can be no blameless explanation for the way they spoke to our friend; nothing seems capable of excusing their persistent lateness . . .\n\nBut though outrage may feel liberating, it is no friend of love. In order to stand any chance of working, a relationship has to involve\u2014on both sides\u2014a continuous attempt to drill beneath difficult words and actions in search of their more complicated, and occasionally touching, origins. Perhaps our partner is feeling sexually insecure; maybe they are unduly threatened by a friend\u2019s financial success because they were never allowed to believe that they could matter in themselves. It\u2019s possible that persistent lateness is a protest against a bullying, coercive, time-obsessed parent . . . Someone may often be a pain\u2014and yet still be worthy of a lot of thought and kindness.\n\nAt the core of the tender person\u2019s outlook is a simple-sounding but love-sustaining fact: they treat the other as no less fragile, flawed, and sensitive than they remember themselves to be\u2014only around slightly different things. Tenderness taps modestly and perceptively into self-knowledge.\n\nWhen love is tender, two partners can together develop an impetus for change: the most easily bruised parts of who they are can dare to be exposed because they know that the other\u2019s touch will be gentle. The things we despaired of anyone understanding about us become, at last, possible to admit to. The strange, sweet aspects of our complicated, troubled minds open up to being explored and accepted in all their lonely oddity and shame.\n\n(IV) A THERAPEUTIC ATTITUDE\n\nTo state it boldly, and to risk sounding a bit strange, all good lovers are in a way good psychotherapists: that is, the success of modern romantic relationships critically depends on the degree to which both partners can, at crucial moments, adopt a therapeutic attitude toward the other\u2019s compulsions, blind spots, rages, and eccentricities.\n\nThis sounds odd to say because we usually see therapy as something only a professional could do in a consulting room after years of training, not as anything that we and a partner might be able to offer one another in the kitchen, the bedroom, or over a cocktail in a small but rather elegant bar.\n\nYet if we drill down into the true nature of psychotherapy our perspective changes. At base, the discipline relies on a theory about how emotional life works. Powerful emotions, therapy says, are triggered in the present by traumas and difficulties that began in a distant and usually largely forgotten past.\n\nThe essence of psychotherapy lies in a willingness to get systematically interested in why we constantly respond in the bizarre and uncalled-for ways we exhibit. It asks by what sequence of formative experiences an otherwise perfectly decent and intelligent person could be led to sob on the floor or threaten to jump out of the window after an argument. It\u2019s less disturbed by a tantrum, a sulk, or a cold withdrawal than curious about where such over-or under-reactions might be coming from.\n\nIn therapy, there is always a good\u2014and often moving story\u2014about why someone ends up shouting \u201cFuck off\u201d to the person they most love or gets icily dismissive when another is pleading for warmth. Perhaps far back, in the old house decades ago, there were genuine, urgent emotional terrors that had to be countered by aggression or evaded by massive psychological withdrawal. While the body has grown, the deep patterns of the mind have stayed the same, so that one now reacts not to what is presently happening but to an old threat that has been unknowingly re-evoked. The brutish words or cold facade are, when the logic of the mind is properly disentangled, directed not at a partner but at a carer, parent, or rival in a now hazy, convoluted back story.\n\nIn the consulting room, disturbed feelings can gradually be repatriated so that we no longer unleash them, haphazardly, on whomever happens to be most prominent in our lives. We grow appropriately therapeutic when we can be genuinely interested in the long history that might be standing behind the least alluring and at times appalling emotional conduct of which we and our partners are capable. As therapeutically minded lovers, we no longer always ask why they are being so horrible to us, we try to work out what other people might long ago have done to and around them.\n\nWe realize that we\u2019ve come along late in the history of others\u2019 souls. They are fighting emotional battles that commenced many years before they could have suspected our existence. They had dug themselves into defensive positions or honed their offensive tactics\u2014to which we are now exposed\u2014by the time they were mastering the eight times table. It isn\u2019t their fault. They didn\u2019t ask to have the childhood they did, they coped as best they could, and now we are simply the haphazard targets for their largely unconscious, albeit often genuinely off-putting, strategies of defense.\n\nAlong the way, psychotherapy teaches us that direct confrontation is seldom a good idea. A therapist might know, pretty much from day one, what a client is suffering from. They might have a solid thesis that the client is mentally scrambled because their mother\u2019s abundant love carried with it a secret command that they must never acknowledge any sexual feelings. Or that they are paranoid because of their father\u2019s displays of violence and cruelty. What counts, though, isn\u2019t that the therapist has developed an accurate diagnosis but that the patient is allowed to recognize it for themselves, by a process of carefully designed prompts, in a way that they can absorb without fear, in their own time. That is why therapists tend to proceed via gentle questions\u2014\u201cI wonder how it felt when Mom went away\u201d\u2014instead of blanket assertions: \u201cLet me tell you why you are so messed up.\u201d\n\nIn relationships, too, therapeutic kindness should mean avoiding direct lectures on the issues we sense in our partners. We try\u2014on a good day\u2014not to say: \u201cI\u2019ve seen through you, I know what\u2019s wrong with you\u2014and why you are running away from me as you are.\u201d And we strive instead to nudge the other toward greater self-knowledge at a pace they can benefit from. There are no prizes for trying to initiate others into varieties of self-awareness they have no strength for.\n\nFurthermore, in relationships that work well, the burden of analytic interpretation never falls on only one person; we\u2019re both prepared to see each other through an even-tempered therapeutic lens. We can mutually promise: \u201cI\u2019ll be less frightened of what\u2019s disturbed yet disguised in you, if you can begin to imagine doing the same for me and my foibles.\u201d\n\nEveryone, during the close-up, prolonged inspection all relationships entail, is sure to reveal themselves as being substantially disturbed. Which is why we so much want and need to be with someone who grasps, with reference to the complexities of our early emotional lives, the essential normality of our oddities. They might win our hearts by saying, on an early date: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about how mad I am, and where it all began, if you\u2019ll tell me how crazy you are, and how Mom and Dad messed you up.\u201d We\u2019ll thereby be deploying the possibilities of a therapeutically minded perspective to help secure the long-term sympathetic love we are looking for.\n\n(V) ENTHUSIASM\n\nWhen relationships start, enthusiasm for our partners tends to be at a pitch. We think of them constantly, we want only to spend more time in their company, we delight in their many skills and accomplishments. We can\u2019t quite get over the way they know how to glide on a dance floor, prepare such tasty soups, read interesting novels, sweet-talk our hard-to-please mother, or calmly perform a life-saving operation on an ailing horse or poodle.\n\nBut this early phase of powerful admiration and longing rarely lasts. A few years in, our partner may still be an administrative whizz, a stylish dancer, a good cook, a knowledgeable thinker, a fixed favorite of our mother, or a superlative vet\u2014and yet we now find it hard to feel or express too much wonderment. A sullenness has taken hold of us that does not lift. There is, somewhere deep inside us, a gigantic, stubborn \u201cbut . . .\u201d\n\nThe corrosion of romantic enthusiasm is one of the grand, intimate, tragic, and rarely told stories of love. It seems to happen almost without our noticing; we gradually slip into a position of no longer being able to admire very much. With time, we may feel loyal to the union we\u2019ve built; we may harbor a deep friendship toward our partner\u2014we\u2019d give them a kidney; but we can\u2019t relish and celebrate their merits as we once did.\n\nThe world often explains this cooling as a sheer and inevitable result of exposure. It is, they say, typical to neglect what is always around. But the true reasons seem more complicated, more psychologically rich and, in their own way, a lot more hopeful.\n\nIf we stop admiring, it is not because we are ever really bored or because it is \u201cnormal\u201d to take someone for granted; it is chiefly only because we are, at some level, furious. Anger creeps into love and destroys admiration. We cease to delight because we unknowingly grow entangled in various forms of unprocessed annoyance. We can\u2019t cheer them on because, somewhere deep inside, we are inhibited by trace memories of certain let-downs, large and small, of which they have been guilty without their knowing. Perhaps they caused us immense difficulties around a work crisis\u2014and never apologized. Maybe they flirted with a friend of ours\u2014and left us feeling tricked and unsure. They may have booked a vacation without asking us\u2014and then insisted that they\u2019d done nothing wrong.\n\nNone of these infractions was, on its own, necessarily particularly serious, but taken cumulatively a succession of minor disappointments can acquire a terrible capacity to dampen and ultimately destroy ardor. Yet it is not the simple fact of being let down that counts very much; the true problem is created when there hasn\u2019t been an opportunity to process our disappointment. Irritation is only toxic when it hasn\u2019t been extensively and thoughtfully aired.\n\nPerhaps we tried to explain what was wrong but we got nowhere. Our partner lost their temper and we gave up. Or, more subtly, we might have felt unentitled to make a fuss over so-called \u201csmall things\u201d and therefore stayed silent even though, in our depths, the small things mattered immensely to us. With great unfairness to our partner, we may have forgotten to admit to our own sensitivities even as we developed a steady burden of resentment against their unknowing offenses.\n\nWhat follows from such buried anger is something that can be mistaken for lack of interest but is in substance very different. We no longer want to celebrate their birthday, we withhold sexual attention, we don\u2019t look up when they walk into a room. This could seem like the normal impact of time and proximity. But it is no such thing. It is evidence of cold fury. We do our anger an honor, and can start to dismantle its deleterious impacts, when we recognize the full impact of unexamined frustration on our emotions. We never simply go off people; we only ever get very angry with them. And then forget we are so.\n\nTo refind our instinctive enthusiasm for our partner, we need to accurately locate our suppressed distress. We have to allow ourselves to be legitimately upset about certain things that have saddened us and then raise them\u2014for as long as we need to\u2014in a way that lets us feel acknowledged and valued. Because anger inflicts an ever-increasing toll the longer it is left unaddressed, a good couple should allow for regular occasions when each person can\u2014without encountering opposition\u2014ask the other to listen to incidents, large or small, in which they felt let down of late. There might be an evening a week left free for this form of \u201cprocessing.\u201d The mission should be bluntly known to both parties: an opportunity to pick up on areas in which we feel let down\u2014not, we should add, in the name of killing love but rather to ensure its ongoing buoyancy. It goes without saying that we might not immediately see why a given thing should matter so much to our partner; but that isn\u2019t the point. The object of the exercise is not to listen to complaints that seem utterly relatable to us; it is to let our partner know that we care because these are problems to them.\n\nTo ensure that our desire never suffers, this kind of hygienic ritual might be placed at the center of every relationship. If couples too often ignore the requirement, it is because they operate under an unfair burden of bravery: they are far more susceptible than they let themselves think. They assume that it cannot be sane to get \u201cupset\u201d so often, to experience so much hurt, to be so easily ruffled. They can\u2019t summon the courage to make a complaint about things that they don\u2019t even admit to themselves have caused a sting\u2014and so stay silent until it is no longer possible for them to feel. Wiser couples know that nothing should ever be too small to cover at length, for what is ultimately at stake in a marathon conversation about a single word or a minuscule event in the hallway can be the fate of the entire relationship. These lovers are in this sense like wise parents who, when a child is sorrowful, are patient enough to enter into the imaginative realm of the child and take the time to find out just how upsetting it was that there was a loud bang in the street or that one of Nounou\u2019s eyes came off. They will devote three and a quarter hours to understanding why a partner got silently immensely upset by the way we said the word \u201cready\u201d to them at breakfast the day before or how it felt to them when we were a touch slow at laughing along with a mildly unfunny story they shared about a train and a suitcase at dinner with our aunt. The gratitude that will flow from such an effort to understand them will be amply repaid the next time we feel abandoned because they forgot to put the lid back on the olives or omitted to add a second x at the end of an email.\n\nTo complain in love is a noble and honorable skill very far removed from the category of whininess with which it is sometimes confused. The irony of well-targeted and quickly raised complaints is that their function is entirely positive. Honesty is a love-preserving mechanism that keeps alive all that is impressive and delightful about our partner in our eyes. By regularly voicing our small sorrows and minor irritations, we are scraping the barnacles off the keel of our relationship and thereby ensuring that we will sail on with continued joy and admiration into an authentic and unresentful future.\n\n2 Love and Psychotherapy\n\nLovers and psychotherapists might, at first glance, seem to have very little to teach one another, but an unexpected way of helping our relationships to flourish can be to study how therapists speak to, and approach the troubles of, their patients. The truths of psychotherapy don\u2019t belong only to clinical practice; they have widespread application in the bedroom and especially outside the bathroom door at midnight during heated arguments about ostensibly very little. When relationships get difficult, as they invariably will, therapeutic ideas can give us ways to understand and cope sympathetically with many of the stranger parts of ourselves and our partners.\n\nThe following therapeutic ideas can prove of particular relevance.",

      "content": "## REFLECTIVE LISTENING\n\nLife constantly brings us into contact with people we care about who\u2014for a range of reasons, perhaps some of them having to do with us\u2014have grown immensely angry or profoundly distressed. We would very much like to calm them down and relieve them of their symptoms, but our techniques for doing so tend to badly miss their targets. When we try to tell them \u201cnot to worry,\u201d they slide into even greater panic. When we say that, all told, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d their irritation heightens. When we explain to them in a warm voice that they could afford to calm down, they pick up a pencil and snap it in two in frustration.\n\nWe would at such points be advised to lean on a technique pioneered and much favored by psychotherapy known as \u201creflective listening.\u201d The theory behind it is that an important share of our most serious problems have no solutions in any practical sense. There are simply no \u201canswers\u201d to losing lots of money, being excluded from a social circle, or failing in a job. Of course, there might be a few steps that could be taken\u2014applying for a loan, throwing a party, or going on a training course\u2014but these are unlikely to be things that we have not thought about before or that could, if implemented, shave off more than a fraction of our pain.\n\nWhat psychotherapy realizes is that, in our agony, what we desire more than anything, more than we usually even understand, is companionship: for someone else to know that we are suffering and to feel a measure of our pain more or less as we experience it. We yearn to feel that another person appreciates the scale of our despair and the magnitude of our sense of injustice, while at the same time being deeply suspicious of, and alert to, anyone who might too hastily be trying to make our distress go away. \u201cAnswers\u201d and \u201csolutions\u201d\u2014because they seek to remove a problem at speed\u2014may in our panicky moments seem indistinguishable from being asked to shut up and talk about something else.\n\nHaving fathomed our longing, psychotherapy introduces a key innovation: it proposes a way of behaving around a person who is incensed or sad that can give them a strong feeling that they are being understood. Saying \u201cI know\u201d or \u201coh yes\u201d won\u2019t\u2014as psychotherapy knows\u2014be quite enough. What we need to do instead is to paraphrase what our ailing companion has said, to build sentences that repeat back to them the essence of the difficulty they have expressed but in different words. This form of precis deftly signals two things: first, that we have precisely grasped what they have gone through, and second, that we have been doing more than listening passively. We haven\u2019t dumbly and distractedly echoed their exact language, as a recording device would; we\u2019ve taken the trouble to find a fresh set of words for the same story. Their woes have passed, and been sympathetically filtered, through the distinctive channels of our own minds.\n\nAn episode of reflective listening might go like this. We hear them say: I hate the bloody lecturers at university so much. They ramble and make no sense. I\u2019m taking on huge debts to be there and I might as well be asleep for all the good it will ever do me. To which we might respond: I\u2019m hearing that your course is proving deeply disappointing. You\u2019re finding it hard to understand what\u2019s really going on. And the faculty don\u2019t seem in any way interested in explaining things properly. You\u2019re worrying about how much all this is costing and what contribution, if any, this is going to make to your career goals.\n\nOr someone might tell us: I don\u2019t see why you jump to such unfair conclusions about me. Why can\u2019t you believe that something just slipped my mind? You\u2019re always accusing me . . . To which a reflective listener might answer: I\u2019m sensing that you don\u2019t feel trusted. You think I don\u2019t have enough faith in your good nature and intentions.\n\nThe genius of reflective listening is that, on the basis of paraphrasing alone, we can leave our speaker appeased and becalmed. Without anything ostensibly changing, the incensed or sad person\u2019s levels of fear and irritation ebb. The squall passes; hope returns. This teaches us just how much \u201csolutions\u201d may ultimately be overrated. All that we are chiefly in search of when we are at our lowest point is evidence that we are in company.",

      "content": "## ROOM FOR DARKNESS\n\nWhenever people tell us their problems, one of our most common, quasi-automatic\u2014and subtly dispiriting\u2014responses is to try to deny the severity of what they have just said to us. Someone tells us that they haven\u2019t been sleeping very well and we respond, with the best of intentions, that not getting a certain number of hours \u201cdoesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Another person tells us that they didn\u2019t get a promotion and we try to be nice by reminding them that they are \u201calready doing very well\u201d as they are.

It\u2019s the holidays.\n\nCHILD: I\u2019m really worried.\n\nPARENT: Darling, that\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s nothing to be scared of in your bedroom.\n\nThe reason for our cheerful rejoinders lies in our unresolved relationship with our own despair, fear, and sadness. We seem so unable to square up to awful things in our lives, we have no option but to try to deny that they might have a place in the lives of others. We become sentimental\u2014that is, addicted to airbrushing away the uncomfortable aspects of reality, out of fear, not deafness.\n\nA more evolved relationship to ourselves\u2014of the kind psychotherapists seek to promote\u2014can assuage the itch to deliver upbeat messages by prompting us to make our peace with sorrow. Someone might say that they are sad and we could in time learn simply, and more helpfully, to answer, \u201cI hear you.\u201d Another might insist, \u201cEverything is awful,\u201d and we might look them warmly in the eye and respond, \u201cYes, it really can feel like that at times.\u201d\n\nThe more we listen to the \u201csad\u201d messages our companions send us, the less hard they will have to push them. The more we hear, the quieter they can be. Someone who says they want to burn the country down doesn\u2019t really want to burn the country down; they want to be heard for the deep frustration that their job or their family is causing them. They will become an arsonist only if we continue not to listen; but not if we do so amply with empathetic good humor. Feelings get less strong, not stronger, once they\u2019ve been acknowledged. It is a move of exemplary generosity and maturity to let someone be sad and desperate around us without falling for the cruel temptation of saying something cheerful.",

      "content": "## SOFTENING LANGUAGE\n\nMuch of our trouble in relationships comes down to the force with which we try to assert certain of our ideas to other people: ideas about who they are, what they\u2019ve been up to and what they are likely to need in order to be happy. An idea of ours may be entirely correct, but the directness with which we attempt to insert it into another\u2019s mind can lead them to recoil and reject it almost as a matter of course, with violence and outrage. The truth, if ever it is to reach another\u2019s consciousness, has to travel in the softest, most hesitant layers of doubt.\n\nThis explains why we\u2019ll so often notice psychotherapists talking to their clients in a way that deftly avoids all powerful assertions or declarations. We won\u2019t\u2014or should never\u2014catch them saying: You\u2019re immature or There\u2019s no point complaining. They are unlikely to utter: It\u2019s your mother\u2019s fault or Leave that no-nothing wastrel!\n\nThey will, instead, typically go in for elaborate circumlocutions to ensure that their ideas feel like being stroked by weightless feathers. They will pepper what they say with markers of graceful and mild intent, repeatedly using terms like perhaps and maybe, somewhat and slightly, a bit and a touch. There will be a bit of regret and a touch of sadness; things will be somewhat difficult and there\u2019s maybe a reason to fight back.\n\nThese therapists will at the same time be powerfully alive to the benefits of saying \u201cI feel\u201d ahead of any analysis of their client\u2019s behavior or attitudes. They know how easily we can be panicked by universal judgments and how much we prefer it when ideas are framed as though they were only ever the thought of one person as opposed to a verdict of the whole community or the fruit of the mind of God himself. They hence opt for digestible suggestions over thunderous generalizations: \u201cI feel you\u2019re withdrawing somewhat . . .\u201d over \u201cYou\u2019re in denial\u201d; \u201cI feel you might be a touch angry . . .\u201d over \u201cYou\u2019re in a rage.\u201d They know that there is a vast difference between \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time\u201d and \u201cI feel you might no longer be getting the results you need . . .\u201d; between \u201cDon\u2019t always blame other people\u201d and \u201cI feel you might be tempted to hold your friend responsible . . .\u201d\n\nIt is common to have vibrant insights into other people\u2019s characters that we would deeply like to share with them. It may suddenly strike us that the whole nature of their problem comes down to their mother. Or that all they need to do is break free from the baleful influence of their younger sister. The issue is not that such insights are necessarily flawed but that they are too potent and threaten to engage, in a ruinous way, the other\u2019s defense mechanisms. Most of what we don\u2019t listen to is far from worthless, it just asks too much of us and therefore has to be expelled from the mind to preserve the emotional status quo. There are truths too true to be heard.\n\nA central way to disarm the danger of suffocating others with reality is therefore to resist the urge to tell them what we suspect is wrong with them. Whatever the provocation and however late the hour, we must never sink to giving out overly direct diagnoses or grand summaries of their condition. There is strictly no point in saying, \u201cIt all comes down to your father . . .\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of intimacy . . .\u201d The novice student of psychology may well be tempted to throw around such fascinating and theoretically highly valid ideas, but if their goal is to be listened to, they would be well advised to reconsider the way they are opting to share their learning.\n\nRather than delivering verdicts, we must\u2014in the name of winning over our audience\u2014signal clearly that we are merely advancing musings, tentative, wholly speculative ruminations that have nothing firm, decisive, or tenacious about them. We really have no clue; we\u2019re just throwing something out and we are, almost certainly, quite wrong.\n\nIt is here that we should have recourse to one of the most emotionally compelling formulations in the psychotherapist\u2019s vocabulary: \u201cI wonder . . .\u201d We must take a brute statement such as, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to seduce someone who doesn\u2019t want you . . .\u201d and carefully recast it with an introductory, \u201cI wonder if you\u2019re attempting to seduce someone who . . .\u201d We might start with, \u201cStop being so rigid about deadlines\u201d but end up, far more usefully, with, \u201cI wonder if you\u2019re not putting a bit too much emphasis on routines . . .\u201d\n\nSuch moves may be apparently small, but their impact can be enormous. That it should be so tells us something very poignant about us. We don\u2019t want anyone to be too certain about our situation, especially those things that might be decisively true but are very hard to take on board. We need the gentlest words to help us come to terms with the most arduous insights.\n\nIt is a bathetic but unavoidable reality of human nature that what can separate our absorption of a truth from its angry and incensed rejection may be nothing more or less than a very small, soft, gossamer-light yet entirely crucial \u201cmaybe.\u201d",

      "content": "## THERAPY KNOWS THAT THE TRUTH TAKES TIME TO ACCEPT\n\nTo an onlooker, one of the strangest aspects of therapy is the sheer length of time it requires. This is especially puzzling because an experienced therapist can typically diagnose the essentials of a person\u2019s troubles in one session. And yet a course of therapy can last two or three years, sometimes five or six, at a rate of one appointment a week, if not more.\n\nAs therapy sees it, the chief difficulty is not to identify someone\u2019s problem but to help them see, feel, and accept it. Were the truth to be baldly laid out before most clients, they would leave at once in a mood of incensed fury: we have only limited strength to hear that, for example, our levels of confidence might be connected up with our father\u2019s behavior toward our sister during our early teenage years or that our anxiety relates to a trauma that occurred before we were three. The trick is to divide a diagnosis into such small portions that it can start to sound like common sense and be benevolently absorbed over a lengthy timescale.\n\nTherapy knows that trust is essential, too, if the truth is to be rendered bearable. We have to like our therapist very much, and have experienced them across a range of topics and developed a comprehensive faith in their personality, so that, when it comes to truly confronting ideas, we can\u2014on a good day\u2014maintain the belief that they are on our side and not simply putting certain thoughts before us in order to cause us pain and bewilderment.\n\nLikewise, we need a partner to have shown us repeated kindness and forbearance before we\u2019ll listen when they tell us important but confronting things that our best friends never dared to raise with us\u2014not because they were any kinder, but because they didn\u2019t care enough.\n\nTherapy is a school of patience. It changes our notions of plausible time frames. In a therapeutically minded relationship, we\u2019re not going to be outraged that after a few weeks with us and two long conversations, our partner still shirks certain responsibilities, still has a wayward notion of punctuality, and still can\u2019t shed certain sexual inhibitions. These challenges are conceived of as deeply embedded in emotional dynamics that might, quite reasonably, take years to dislodge themselves. With the example of therapy in mind, we will in our own relationships look for tiny signs of progress rather than rapid, radical change around all those behaviors and thoughts that we so wish would vanish at a stroke.",

      "content": "## WHAT IS NOT BEING SAID\n\nTherapists famously listen to their clients carefully, but as much as they are listening to what\u2019s being said, they are equally attuned to what is not being said, to emotions that should be expressed given what is being recounted\u2014for instance, a terrible story about loss or neglect\u2014and yet have somehow drifted out of the story, relegated to the unconscious under the weight of untenable psychic pain. Someone might tell a therapist about their father\u2019s sudden arrest and six-month stay in prison, then end with a small laugh and the remark, \u201cIt was all quite funny really.\u201d But the therapist won\u2019t be laughing back.\n\nTheir aim will be to reunite their client with their exiled feelings. So they might pause, at the end of an ostensibly cheery tale about something dreadful, and say, \u201cThat must have been very frightening . . .\u201d or \u201cIt seems so unfair really\u201d\u2014and hope thereby to help the client recover contact with their authenticity and truth.\n\nLikewise, a skilled lover will know that pride and misplaced bravery might frequently lead their partner into diversionary behaviors and stories that mask their actual feelings. After returning from a lunch with their mother, they might turn the bitter relationship they have with her into a succession of humorous anecdotes involving the old lady and the waiter. But a tender lover schooled by therapy might add a small rejoinder: \u201cIt sounds like she still manages to hurt you every time you see her. It can\u2019t be easy.\u201d We would then, as the partner, perceive that we had landed on that most special of beings: someone\u2014like the best sort of therapist and the most enticing of lovers\u2014who knows us better than we know ourselves.",

      "content": "## TOLERATING AMBIVALENCE\n\nOne of the ideas about which therapy remains most sanguine is that our feelings are seldom pure. There is rarely a love which is not, at some level, accompanied by a kind of hatred, just as there is rarely a disdain that doesn\u2019t have a strand of affection concealed somewhere within it.\n\nTherapy knows that there are few loving mothers who do not, at points, wish their babies dead. And few respectful, affectionate children who do not fantasize that their parents might be annihilated, if only for a while. It knows, too, that it\u2019s wholly normal to love someone and fantasize about having sex with someone else; or to completely forget why we ever committed to a partner only to recover the thread of our story a few hours later. Therapy is unbothered by the strangeness of our disloyal and entangled feelings. It knows that we are all a good deal stranger than we\u2019re allowed to admit and it lets us be as unconventional as is helpful without judging or taking fright.\n\nA lover schooled in therapy can adopt a similar sangfroid. Of course there will be moments of intense hatred and declarations of catastrophe and panic. But this is no reason to think a relationship is doomed\u2014just as a two-year-old child who bites their mother in a fit of frustration in the kitchen is not to be understood as making any long-term statement about their feelings for her. With the example of therapy in mind, we\u2019ll be less upset by squalls, less frightened of viciousness, and better able to hear with wry patience that we are apparently a shit-faced bastard who ruined someone\u2019s life\u2014only, ten minutes later, to hear an addendum that we are also someone our partner will love to eternity. Anger and irritation don\u2019t destroy love; they are inevitable parts of being genuinely close to and extremely dependent on another human being.\n\nA therapeutic attitude taps into a proper recognition of the many contradictions of the mind. It prepares us for the fact that, if we are ever to make a good shared life together with someone, we\u2019ll have no option but to confront and accept\u2014and in the end finally love\u2014the infinitely strange and wondrous complexity of a fellow human.\n\n3 Simpler Relationships\n\nMany people, after they\u2019ve been in a relationship for some time, will privately admit that they are in many ways frustrated and disappointed by the person they\u2019ve chosen to share their lives with. If pressed for details, they will have no difficulty coming up with a list of complaints about their partner:\n\nis too loyal to their irritating family\n\ndoesn\u2019t share their views on the layout of the living room\n\nnever wants to go camping\n\nplays tennis every Wednesday evening, no matter what\n\ndoesn\u2019t like Moroccan food\n\ndoesn\u2019t share their enthusiasm for nineteenth-century Russian novels\n\nhas a friend who laughs for no apparent reason\n\nlikes doing jigsaws\n\ndrinks coffee from a big mug with \u201c1984\u201d inscribed on the side\n\nhas a habit of adding \u201cactually\u201d to every second sentence, when it\u2019s actually redundant . . .\n\nAs the list gets longer, they sigh. They still love their partner and long to be happy with them, it\u2019s just that it seems impossibly complicated to make this relationship work.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the frustration isn\u2019t that they\u2019ve sadly fallen for an idiot as a mate; it\u2019s rather that we have all inherited needlessly complicated ideas of what a relationship is supposed to be for. We are told that love is meant to involve the almost total merger of two lives: We expect that a loving couple must live in the same house, eat the same meals together every night, share the same bed, go to sleep and get up at the same time, only ever have sex with, or even sexual thoughts about, each other, regularly see each other\u2019s families, have all their friends in common, and pretty much think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful vision, but a hellish one too, for it places an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another human. We feel our partner must be right for us in every way, and if they\u2019re not, then they have to be prodded and cajoled into reform.\n\nBut there\u2019s another perspective: relationships don\u2019t have to be so complicated and ambitious if we keep in view what in the end actually makes them fulfilling. If we boil matters down, there might really be\u2014as we have seen\u2014only five essential things we want from one another. The things we have to make an intelligent fuss about concern our core emotional requirements, which broadly give rise to our five fundamental demands. Our requests to our lovers might sound as follows:\n\nI need you to accept\u2014often and readily\u2014the possibility that you might be at fault, without this feeling to you like the end of the world. You have to allow that I can have a legitimate criticism and still love you. I need you to be undefensive.\n\nI need you to own up to what you are embarrassed or awkward about in yourself. I need you to know how to access the younger parts of you without terror. I need you to be able to be vulnerable around me.\n\nI need you to respond warmly, gently, and compassionately to the fragile parts of who I am; to listen to, and understand, my sorrows. We need a union of mutual tenderness.\n\nI need you to have a complex, nuanced picture of me and to understand the emotional burdens I\u2019m carrying, even though I wish I weren\u2019t, from the past. You have to see me with something like the generosity associated with therapy.\n\nI need you to regularly air your disappointments and irritations with me\u2014and for me to do the same with you\u2014so that the currents of affection between us can remain warm and our capacity for admiration intense.\n\nIf these five critical demands have been met, we will feel loved and essentially satisfied whatever differences then crop up in a hundred other areas. Perhaps our partner\u2019s friends or routines won\u2019t be a delight, but we will be content. Just as if we lack these emotional goods, and yet agree on every detail of European literature, interior design, and social existence, we are still likely to feel lonely and bereft.\n\nBy limiting what we expect a relationship to be about, we can overcome the tyranny and bad temper that bedevil so many lovers. A good, simpler\u2014yet very fulfilling\u2014relationship could end up in a minimal state. We might not socialize much together. We might hardly ever encounter each other\u2019s families. Our finances might overlap only at a few points. We could be living in different places and only meet up twice a week. Conceivably we might not even ask too many questions about each other\u2019s sex life. But when we do come together it would be profoundly gratifying, because we would be in the presence of someone who knew how to be kind, vulnerable, and understanding.\n\nA bond between two people can be deep and important precisely because it is not played out across all practical details of existence. By simplifying and clarifying what a relationship is for, we release ourselves from overly complicated conflicts and can focus on making sure our urgent underlying needs are sympathized with, seen, and understood.\n\n4 Untragic Endings\n\nNews of the end of a relationship tends to be greeted with deep solemnity in our societies. It is hard to think of a breakup except in terms of a minor tragedy. People will offer condolences as they might after a funeral.\n\nThis in turn reflects an underlying philosophy of love: we are taught that the natural and successful outcome of any love story is to remain with a person until their or our death. So, by implication, any breakup must be interpreted as a failure governed by overwhelming hostility on one or both sides.\n\nBut there\u2019s another scenario in which we understand that we are separating not because our relationship has gone badly but precisely because it has gone well. It is ending because it has succeeded. Rather than breaking up with feelings of hurt, bitterness, regret, and guilt, we\u2019re parting with a sense of mutual gratitude and joint accomplishment.\n\nThis counterintuitive but real possibility has an unexpected source. It comes from having kept a crucial question in mind throughout our time together: What is this relationship for? The enquiry may feel negative; we can imagine asking it in a deeply disillusioned tone of voice. But it can and should be asked positively and eagerly\u2014with the aim of finding a good answer that goes to the heart of love.\n\nNormally, we imagine love as a kind of ownership: full of admiration, two people agree to buy one another, as they might a static, beguiling object. But there is another, more dynamic and less hidebound way to interpret love: as a particular kind of education. In this view, a relationship essentially comprises a mutual attempt to learn from and teach something to another person. We are drawn to our partners because we want to be educated by them and vice versa. We love them because we see in them things that we long for that are missing in us; we aspire to grow under the tutelage of love.\n\nFor example, a partner might at the outset have been confident but gentle\u2014a combination that, until we met them, seemed impossible. Or they knew how to laugh at themselves, while we were too withheld and solemn to do so. Or they had a practical competence that we found delightful and moving precisely because it was lacking in us. We could accurately say in such cases that the purpose of the relationship was to teach us confidence or gentleness, or how to laugh at our own idiocy or to become more dexterous\u2014or a thousand other qualities depending on who we both are. The point is, there will be some specific and highly important things we need to do together that will define what the relationship is for.\n\nBy being with our partner, by intertwining our lives, by listening to them, even by being criticized or nagged by them, we will gradually be able to internalize what they have to teach us. But there may legitimately come a point where we have absorbed as much from them as we can. Thanks to our partner, we really are more mature beings than we were when we got together: we\u2019re more balanced and wiser; they\u2019ve helped us to become a little more like the people we always wished to be.\n\nPrecisely because our relationship has had a great, intimate, loving purpose, it can get completed. It can be finished in the sense in which a novel can be finished\u2014not because the writer has got sick of the trials of writing but because they have, through plenty of difficulties, brought the project to a good resolution. Or, more poignantly perhaps, a relationship can be finished in the way that childhood can be finished: a child\u2014thanks to the immense devotion of their parents\u2014reaches a point at which, in order to progress further, they need to leave home. They\u2019re not being kicked out in anger or running away in despair; they\u2019re leaving because the work of childhood has been done. This isn\u2019t a rejection of love; it is love\u2019s good consequence. Finishing isn\u2019t a sign of failure but of background success.\n\nThe difference in these cases is that we\u2019ve clearly understood what all our efforts were for. There was a goal in mind: The writing shouldn\u2019t go on for ever, the child should leave home. But because, unfortunately, we have not asked what our relationship is for, we can\u2019t normally get to this sense of having reached a proper ending. Or else we are refusing to ask because the only motive for the relationship is to ensure that we are not alone\u2014which is never, when we reflect on it, really a good enough reason to monopolize someone else\u2019s life.\n\nIn an ideal relationship, the sense of completion would be completely mutual. The painful reality, however, is that we may sometimes want to leave while our partner wants us to stay together. But the idea of love as education can still apply: Our unbearable conflicts mean that we\u2019ve stopped being able to teach one another anything. We may know important qualities they should learn but we\u2019re not the right teacher: We currently lack the patience, the skill, the charm, or the self-confidence to transmit insights in a way that will work for them. We have done all we can. Our task is complete, not because our partner has nothing left to learn, but because we aren\u2019t the right person to guide them. We are entitled to leave without feeling we are abandoning anyone.\n\nWe can avoid feeling devastated by a breakup knowing that there are still so many other ways in which we need to develop. We may have learned so much but we\u2019re still far from complete. It\u2019s just that the lessons we now have to take on board are going to come from someone else\u2014or from the always profoundly educative experience of being on our own for a while.",

      "content": "## III : Art\n\nArt can be a tool with which to combat some of our worst mental afflictions. When it shows us pretty and inspiring things and even\u2014especially when\u2014it shows us melancholy ones, it fortifies us against nihilism and hardness of heart.\n\nWe all benefit from having to hand a private gallery of images to shore us up. What follows is an example of such a museum of the mind. It has little to do with those grand national galleries of art sculpted from granite and marble where floors are dedicated to the important movements of art\u2014and where, exhausted and overwhelmed, our thoughts wisely often soon turn to the cafeteria and\u2014with luck\u2014cake. This is a miniature gallery of images that we might look at in bed or in the bath to slow down and reverse a slide into self-hatred and terror. It wants us to hang on and wait for dawn.\n\nReligions knew what art was for. It had nothing to do with remembering dates or understanding techniques. It was for crying with and imploring. It was for kneeling down in a solemn hall in front of, so that Vishnu or Guanyin, Mary or Nivaranaviskhambhin could hear what was tearing us apart: that there would be no more money at the end of the month, that our partner was cold-hearted, that we had seduced the wrong person, that our children had no love in them, that we felt like a failure, that we wanted to die.\n\nWe may no longer believe in gods very much, but this doesn\u2019t mean that art has abandoned its capacity to console and rescue us. Secular works of art\u2014a careful painting of four daffodils in a jar in early April, a silvery photograph of the Sierra Nevada, an embroidered tapestry of a llama, an abstract canvas of dark blues and greens, a sketch of a sheep and its young, or a study of a river at dusk\u2014retain the power to rescue our moods and rearrange our priorities.\n\nIn this small portable museum, we are invited to be as emotional as we might once have felt in a temple or a church. We can fall into solemn reflection, we can cry, we can feel sorry for ourselves, and we can vow to change our lives. The artists would have wanted us to do so very much.\n\nIt may be a time of distress right now; it might be night and we might be in a hotel, a clinic, or an unheated spare bedroom. It may feel as though we are entirely alone and that no one could possibly understand. They do.\n\nAs much as pills, therapy, walks, a thoughtful friend, baths, a lot of sleep, and perhaps the occasional fig, this gallery of images is a tool in the service of our frayed psyches. This is art against despair.\n\n1 Six Persimmons\n\nEverything has become abundant, everything is in reach. We can have produce from the four corners. Fruit is flown in from anywhere\u2014even persimmons, which taste rich and honey-like when ripe, with the texture of an apricot and a skin like an apple\u2019s.\n\nBut the tragedy is also that we don\u2019t notice anything much of what we have. Buddhism takes aim at our haste and our neglect. In failing to appreciate the things before us, we become far more avaricious and dissatisfied than we need to be. We dream of fame and elevated status. We call our circumstances narrow and uninspiring, when in reality we have omitted to do them justice. We seek a better world without having taken stock of the one already to hand. If we were able to open our eyes, there would be so many universes for us to see right in front of us.\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist monk\u2014no one is ever just an \u201cartist\u201d in Buddhism\u2014Muqi Fachang completed his rendition of six persimmons in the middle of the thirteenth century, around the end of the Southern Song dynasty. Those with a sympathy for the lessons of his creed have been looking at them carefully ever since, especially after they reached Japan in 1606 and were given pride of place in a meditation hall in the Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\nThere is ostensibly nothing very special about the persimmons\u2014and that is precisely the point. Those who are in a hurry, those who are unable in the end to notice and draw value from anything, will rush past them as they will so much else. Muqi is trying to slow down our impatient gaze. He deliberately empties the visual field and sets these modest works of nature in front of us for reflective contemplation, daring us to ignore them while also beseeching us\u2014with all the resources of his art\u2014not to.\n\nThe painting\u2019s guardians in Kyoto traditionally asked that we pause to look at the work for at least three minutes, which can feel like an awfully long time. But when we accept the challenge, after around the first thirty seconds our breathing is likely to slow and we may start to see how much there is to appreciate. Each persimmon, though \u201cthe same\u201d from a distance, emerges as distinct in size, shape, and color. What we might initially have thought of as identical declares itself as rife with difference. Each persimmon is, we can now see, as individual as a child is to its parent.\n\nWhat Muqi asked us to do with pieces of fruit we might carry out with the world more broadly: We might take a second and third look at loaves of bread, clouds, paving stones, the books on our shelves, blades of grass and\u2014most importantly\u2014one another. Once we have learned to draw value from inexpensive things, we can never be poor, whatever our ostensible level of wealth, and we can never be bored, however quiet things might have become. The persimmons are with great humility doing momentous work for us: They are pointing us toward a path of liberation.\n\nMuqi Fachang, Six Persimmons, 13th century.\n\n2 Albrecht D\u00fcrer and His Pillows\n\nOne of the most beautiful and unexpectedly moving sketches in the world was completed by the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1493, when he was twenty-two years old and apprenticed in his native Nuremberg. It shows six pillows, probably his own, in a variety of shapes and positions.\n\nOn the other side of the paper, D\u00fcrer drew himself looking at us with penetration and inquisitiveness, alongside a version of his hand and, at the bottom, for good measure, another\u2014seventh\u2014pillow.\n\nA pillow has no distinguished place in the order of the universe. We are unlikely ever to have paid much attention to this modest household object. We take its existence for granted, owe it no special gratitude and are unlikely ever to have been detained by its qualities. Like so much else that we are surrounded by, we see it without noticing it. It belongs to a vast category of things which we rely on without for an instant stopping to wonder at, or deriving any satisfaction from, them. We are\u2014for the most part\u2014wholly blind.\n\nIn the face of our customary inattention, it may help us greatly that, a long time ago, a genius arrested his gaze in order to tell us that, among the neglected detritus of a household, there might be something worth bothering with; that a pillow, properly considered, might be as interesting as a castle or as nuanced as a poem; and that we have all along been putting our heads down on a treasury.\n\nIt matters, too\u2014though it shouldn\u2019t ideally\u2014that D\u00fcrer\u2019s work is highly acclaimed; that the pillow image is stored in a special temperature-controlled room in New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art; that it has been the subject of extensive study by elaborately trained art historians; and that it has a higher value than a sports car. We are, by nature, immoderately snobbish creatures and appreciate principally what we have been encouraged to be curious about by the most prestigious voices in society. This means that we spend a lot of time thinking about fame and glory, and no time at all attending to most of what lies closest to us, which includes not just our pillows, but also the lemon on the sideboard, the light at dusk, an afternoon free of commitments, the flowers in the garden, the laughter of a child, the kindness of a friend, a history book on the shelf, and the many small moments of harmony and satisfaction that\u2014despite our many difficulties\u2014we have already witnessed.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Six Studies of Pillows (verso), 1493.\n\nOne of the most acclaimed artists of the European Renaissance lends us his immense prestige in order that we might in turn learn to draw pleasure from thoroughly unprestigious things. We declare our lives to be worthless, we cast envious glances at the achievements of our rivals, but all along we trample on what keener, more alert eyes would know how to feast on.\n\nThroughout his career, D\u00fcrer looked at ordinary life and saw it for the unlikely, ecstatic, jewel-filled pantheon it is. Some years after the pillows, he completed a study of a range of ordinary plants and grasses and wondered at the capacity of the smallest clod of earth to give life to so much beauty and interest.\n\nNothing could be further from the realm of worldly ambition than a few columbines. Such flowers grow freely in seemingly unpromising stony soil. There\u2019s no market for them; no one has ever boasted of owning what is more or less a weed. But for D\u00fcrer, such spectacles of nature were among the most serious sources of pleasure that exist, worth as much as any coat of arms and more likely to satisfy us than a love affair. He relished the delicacy of shoots. He admired the individuality of petals and the subdued yet subtle colors of new leaves. Fulfillment\u2014which we are taught exists only in a good reputation, financial achievement, and costly decorative objects\u2014may be already here, waiting for us in a crack in the sidewalk or in a window box.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Self-Portrait, Study of a Hand and a Pillow (recto), 1493.\n\nWe may not have D\u00fcrer\u2019s talent but we don\u2019t, in this instance, need it. We\u2019re not trying to become artists; we\u2019re trying to become people who have reasons to live. And in this regard, D\u00fcrer is generous. He is reminding us that there are reasons everywhere: in the way the light falls on a cup, in a few words with someone who still cares about us, in a banana cake we might make tomorrow. The lesson is not to focus on exactly the same things that D\u00fcrer studied\u2014though we might do this too\u2014it\u2019s to take his attitude of generosity, openness, and modesty and apply it to our own circumstances. We might find our version of his satisfaction in a pattern of lichen on an old stone wall or in the refined elegance of a boiled egg.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Columbine, 1495\u20131500.\n\nSo compelling was D\u00fcrer\u2019s skill as an artist that he came to the notice of the rich and powerful of his day, including\u2014most consequentially\u2014the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. Maximilian loved horses, wars, armor, and pageantry. Most of all, he loved himself, for all the grand and important things he had done: expanding the Habsburg dynasty to Spain, recapturing Austria, checking the power of the French. He asked D\u00fcrer to make him a work of art that would fully celebrate his achievements, his character, and his place in history\u2014and urged him to make it as big as possible. Money was no object. The result was one of the largest prints ever made, three meters high, laid out on thirty-six gigantic sheets of paper from 195 separate woodblocks. The central arch was called \u201cHonour and Might,\u201d the right arch \u201cNobility\u201d and the left arch\u2014quite simply\u2014\u201cPraise.\u201d Each one was densely packed with illustrations highlighting Maximilian\u2019s wisdom, courage, strength, popularity, and good nature. In one area, there was a complicated family tree that traced his lineage back to Clovis I, the first king of the Franks, and in another, a table that equated his achievements with those of Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.\n\nMaximilian was delighted. He praised D\u00fcrer to all the aristocracy and had copies of the work delivered to every corner of his lands. But the artist was less content: He had done it for the money and his heart wasn\u2019t remotely into such bombast. Too much in his character went in other directions: toward the everyday, toward humility, and toward an awareness of how disaster might strike each one of us, even or especially the mighty ones, at any moment.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Triumphal Arch, c. 1515.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, The Four Horsemen, from \u201cThe Apocalypse,\u201d 1498.\n\nD\u00fcrer\u2019s mind was dominated by terrifying visions of what fate might have in store: disease, famine, injustice, and war laying waste to our dreams and ambitions. In his self-portraits, he never disguised his anxiety. In a second early work, he showed himself holding in his right hand a shriveled thistle, a symbol of pain, decay, and defeat. His look of suspicion and wariness is directed not at us but at himself. He knew how quickly, and with how few wrong moves, we can all be undone.\n\nRuin or disgrace may well catch up with us. Things collapse, plans turn sour\u2014shortly after the arch was done, for example, Maximilian fell into a depression and, inconsolable, insisted on sleeping in a coffin, which was carried around all day with him; he died a few years later. But we don\u2019t always need the very large elements of our lives to succeed in order for existence to be bearable. We can survive and in distinctive ways thrive through a disciplined focus on the smaller elements around us that lie more reliably within our command and that offer us pleasure without exacting envy or punishing effort. We can nourish ourselves on the sight of flowers, on the smell of freshly baked bread, on an evening writing our diary, or on a walk around the park. We can take pleasure in an apricot, in a hot bath, in some flowering weeds\u2014and, not least, in our own set of pillows that have so often and so generously, in the wake of our disappointments, received our tears.\n\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Portrait of the Artist with a Thistle Flower, 1493.\n\n3 Kersting and Lamplight\n\nWe might be tempted to feel rather sorry for someone who confessed that their greatest pleasure in life was staying at home\u2014or, yet worse, that their deepest satisfactions sprang from interior design. What would need to have gone wrong for someone to prefer their own bedroom or kitchen to the theaters and clubs, parties and conference venues of the world? How narrow would someone\u2019s horizons need to have grown for them to devote hours to choosing a flower-ringed vase for the sideboard or a brass lamp for the study? Our era has a hard time maintaining sympathy for domesticity. Reality lies outside our doors. There are really only two categories of people who can be forgiven for being heavily invested in staying at home: small children . . . and losers.\n\nBut after launching our ambitions on the high seas, after trying for a few decades to make a mark on our times, after exhausting ourselves sucking up to those in power and coping with gossip, slander, and scandal, we might start to think less harshly of those who prefer to remain within their own walls and think a lot\u2014and with pride\u2014about cushions and jugs, pencil pots and garlic crushers, laundry cupboards and cleaning products.\n\nIt might, of course, be preferable to manage to bend the world to our own will, to tidy up the minds of millions, or to fashion a business in our own image, but after a bit of time on the planet, some of us may be ready to look with new understanding and admiration at those who can draw satisfaction from making blackberry jam, planting beds of lavender, or waxing bedroom floors.\n\nThe painter Georg Friedrich Kersting was born in northern Germany in 1785 and as a young man wanted to become a great military general and perform heroic deeds in battle. He dreamed of helping to expel the French armies that, under Napoleon, occupied large areas of the German states. After briefly studying art in Copenhagen, Kersting joined the L\u00fctzow Free Corps, a Prussian volunteer force, and saw action at the Battle of the G\u00f6hrde, in which thousands lost their lives and after which he received the Iron Cross for bravery.\n\nBut after the defeat of Napoleon, during the political impasse that befell the German states, something changed in Kersting. He retired from the military, gave up on politics, moved to Dresden, got married, had some children\u2014and became very interested in the idea of home.\n\nHe had had enough of the machinations of government and the schemes of generals, of German nationalism and wars of liberation. Such ventures and the ideals that supported them became bound up in his mind with hubris and overreach. He was haunted by the bloodletting that he had witnessed and the friends from the military he had lost. From now on, what would interest him was the challenge of leading a good enough ordinary life in domestic circumstances and of remaining sane and serene when there was so much that might unbalance and perturb him. He closed the door on the world and became a prophet of the consolations and beauty of home.\n\nIn 1817, Kersting completed one of the most quietly remarkable and beguiling of all paintings. Embroiderer shows a young woman in a dignified modest dress absorbed in her work at an open window. We cannot see her face but can imagine her lips pursed in concentration, the little finger on her right hand extended and taut as she struggles to thread her needle. The interior is peaceful and inviting, without being in any way showy or extravagant. Someone has thought hard about how the mauve couch will create an intriguing contrast with the green wallpaper, and the chunky wooden floorboards have been matched up with an especially graceful chair and table, suggesting a reconciliation between practicality and elegance.\n\nGeorg Friedrich Kersting, Embroiderer, 1817.\n\nA few years later, Kersting completed an equally iconic companion piece. This time it is night and a woman is again at work, doing some darning. A lamp has been swung into place and the room is bathed in a soft light\u2014soon it will be time to make some camomile tea, kiss somebody on the forehead and rearrange their teddy and then, gradually, go to bed. The task isn\u2019t distinguished or obviously memorable, there will be no government medals or honors handed out as thanks for it, but, through Kersting\u2019s eyes, we\u2019re in no doubt that something very special is going on. The sitter has been cast as a secular saint of a new home-focused creed which rejects prevailing assumptions about where glory might lie and what must count as intelligent and purposeful. Perhaps those who focus on home will not gain distinction or renown, their graves will not commemorate any obviously glittering deed, but they will nevertheless have played a role in supporting civilization. It is to misunderstand where satisfaction lies to insist that fulfillment can exist only in cabinet rooms and boardrooms, stock markets and opera houses. The more imaginative will know the distinctive pleasures of preparing a family meal or painting a room, hanging a new picture or filling a vase with hyacinths and lilies of the valley.\n\nGeorg Friedrich Kersting, Young Woman Sewing by Lamplight, 1823.\n\nWe might once have wanted to tame and educate the entire world, to have millions of people agree with us and gain the adulation of strangers. But such plans are inherently unstable and open to being destroyed by envy and vanity. We should gain security from knowing how much a devotion to home can shore up our moods if our wider surroundings grow hostile. When we have become a laughing stock, when no one wants to know us any more, we can reactivate our dormant appreciation of our surroundings and find meaning in nothing greater or smaller than sewing on a few buttons in the late evening or choosing a new fabric for a chair. Kersting was not naive: he understood how war, politics, and business worked. But it was precisely because he did so that he was keen to throw his spotlight elsewhere. His art was\u2014in the deep sense\u2014political, in that it articulated a vision of how we should ideally live: It covertly criticized military generals and emperors, business leaders and actors. It told us that waving flags at rallies or sounding important at meetings was all well and good, but that the true battles were really elsewhere, in the trials of ordinary existence, and that what counted as a proper victory was an ability to remain calm in the face of provocation, not to despair, not to give way to bitterness, to vanquish paranoia, to decode our own mind and to pay due attention to passing moments of grace.\n\nKersting spent much time in his own study, which he represented in a number of sketches and one especially famous painting. He must sometimes have regretted his old ambitions. It must have hurt that he never made a fortune and that he remained, in his lifetime, relatively undiscovered. There would have been days when he felt that he had made all the wrong choices. Nevertheless, his art continues to be a point of reference for those who have had enough of trying to bring order to the public square. It urges us to accept the consolation and peace available in ceasing to worry what others think and learning to limit our ambitions to the boundaries of our own dwellings and laundry cupboards.\n\nGeorg Friedrich Kersting, Man Reading by Lamplight, 1814.\n\nTonight, we might\u2014once more\u2014choose to stay in, do some reading, finish patching a hole in a cardigan, try a new place for the armchair, and be intensely grateful that we have overcome the wish to live too much in the minds of strangers.\n\n4 Hokusai and Melancholy\n\nThere are two ways of looking at Mount Fuji. As a geological phenomenon, it is classified as an active basalt composite stratovolcano, 3,700 meters high and 10,000 years old in its most recent form, which last exploded in 1708. Located on the island of Honshu in central Japan, on the fault line where the Eurasian, Okhotsk, and Philippine plates meet, it has a mounting pressure inside its magma chamber of 1.6 megapascals and an average temperature at its summit of \u22125\u00b0C (23\u00b0F).\n\nBut Mount Fuji is simultaneously a psycho-spiritual phenomenon interpreted in both the Shinto and Zen Buddhist traditions as a conduit to, and guardian of, wisdom and enlightenment. There are temples and rituals in its honor. It is understood to have a meaning; it wants to tell us things. For Buddhism, humans are perpetually at risk of forgetting their true irrelevant position within the natural world. We overlook our powerlessness and unimportance in the universal order. This amnesia isn\u2019t a helpful illusion; it is responsible for much of our frustration, anger, and vain self-assertion. We rage at events because we cannot see the necessities we are up against. Buddhism regularly turns our attention to natural elements\u2014rocks, rain showers, streams, giant cedar trees, the stars\u2014because it sees in these ways we can gracefully come to terms with our denied subservience. We can be reminded that we have no alternative but to submit to nature\u2019s laws and that our freedom comes from adjusting our individual egos to what defies us. For Zen, Fuji is only the largest conveyor of a general truth, but it deserves special reverence because of the extraordinary elegance and primordial simplicity with which it delivers its message. Its beauty, visible on a clear day when its cone is newly sprinkled with snow, makes it a little easier to accept that we will die, that our plans will be ground to sand, that what we achieve will not matter and that we are as nothing next to the aeons of time to which the earth has been witness.\n\nThe printmaker and artist Katsushika Hokusai was in his seventies and already famous in Japan when he hit on the idea that would immortalize his name. The project was to capture Fuji obliquely, to make it feel almost by the by and yet also magnetically present in a series of \u201cThirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,\u201d published between 1830 and 1832. Hokusai never lets us forget the contrast between the eternal steadiness of Fuji, constantly resplendent and serene somewhere in the background, and the agitation, struggle, pain and overexcitement of human lives. We catch Fuji peeking out from behind a busy bridge over the Onagi river as it joins the Sumida; it\u2019s in the background as workers and travelers do business together in the Sundai district of Edo; it\u2019s there as a peasant leads a horse laden with saddlebags full of grass in Senju; it\u2019s watching as a half-naked craftsman makes a barrel in Owari province and as workers fix the roof of the Mitsui department store in Edo (a sign says: \u201cCash only\u201d); it\u2019s discreetly in the frame as some clam fishermen fill their baskets in Noboto Bay and a group of pleasure seekers have refreshments at a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) on Goten-Yama Hill near Shinagawa.\n\nIn some of the prints, the contrast between the puny defenselessness of vainglorious humans and the indifference of mighty nature is at a pitch. We feel pity and melancholy for our pride and what we are up against. In the tenth view in the series, we see a group of travelers wending their way around rice paddies on the eastern sea route near Ejiri in Suruga province. It\u2019s fall and a gust of wind has just blown. That\u2019s all that may be needed to break our fragile hold on order. Hokusai\u2019s humans are at once thrown into chaos. They struggle to hold on to their hats, their possessions fly into the paddy fields, and most notably someone\u2019s papers\u2014they might be anything from the manuscript of a novel to some tax returns, though what they really stand for is human logic and presumption\u2014are being carried off into oblivion, to end up in an adjoining province or a nearby muddy ditch. This, Hokusai is telling us, is what man is: easily buffeted, one gust away from disaster, defenseless before nature, trying to work out what it all means on bits of paper that are as evanescent as fireflies.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, Ejiri in Suruga Province (Sunsh\u016b Ejiri), from the series \u201cThirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanj\u016brokkei),\u201d c. 1830\u201332.\n\nIn the eighth view, the sun is setting over Fuji; it will be dark in half an hour. A couple of hikers are ascending the steep Inume Pass while, a long way behind them, two traders are following with heavily laden horses. We can tell this latter pair are in trouble. Those horses won\u2019t make it up the pass in the darkness; there\u2019s a strong risk someone will fall down a precipice. This may be the end of the road for the unfortunate traders. But the wider mood is not mournful or panicked. Fuji is serene, as it always is, even when in its shadow people are being buried or dying of cancer or imploring the heavens or regretting their lives. Nature doesn\u2019t care one bit about us\u2014which is both the origin of our damnation and, when we have learned to identify with its motions, a source of redemption.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, The Inume Pass in Kai Province (K\u014dsh\u016b Inume t\u014dge), from the series \u201cThirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanj\u016brokkei),\u201d c. 1830\u201332.\n\nThen there is the most famous view of all, the first in the series. Three fishing boats are out at sea off the coast of Kanagawa. They are the fast oshiokuri-bune boats, each powered by eight muscular rowers, that would catch fresh fish\u2014typically tuna, sea bass, or flounder\u2014for the marketplaces and restaurants of Edo. But today nature has other plans. It doesn\u2019t care about this evening\u2019s uramaki or the lives of thirty little people with families and dependants and hopes of their own. It\u2019s decided to send a giant wave, twelve meters high, to toss things about and remind humanity of who is in charge. We shudder at the fate of the fishermen and the other passengers on board. This doesn\u2019t look like a picture of survival, more of a prelude to a wake. Fuji looks on impassively, appearing like a wave of its own, its tiny-seeming snow-capped peak impersonating the foaming sea closer by. We are pawns in the hands of forces that care nothing for us and will not mourn us a moment when we are gone.\n\nHokusai could have chosen to anchor his melancholy meditations on human powerlessness to any number of natural phenomena: \u201cThirty-six Views of the Moon,\u201d \u201cThirty-six Views of Drifting Clouds,\u201d \u201cThirty-six Views of the Constellation Cassiopeia\u201d\u2014a dim speck in the northern hemisphere 4,000 light years away. Against these, too, his genius could have shown up our exploits in all their absurdity: a couple squabbling, a writer finishing a book, a person weeping at their medical diagnosis, a lover pining for companionship.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai, Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as The Great Wave, from the series \u201cThirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanj\u016brokkei),\u201d c. 1830\u201332.\n\nWe are fated to have to take seriously ambitions and desires that make no sense in the wider scheme. We have to live knowing that most of what we do is in a cosmic sense ridiculous. Our lives are no more profound than those of an earthworm and almost as fragile. In so far as we can ever recover a little meaning, it is by ceasing to worry so much about ourselves and identifying instead with planetary reality\u2014even to the point where we might contemplate our own mortality with a degree of resigned equanimity, fully and generously appreciating our absurdity\u2014and using it as a springboard to kindness, art, and the right kind of sadness.\n\n5 Mark Rothko and the Seagram Murals\n\nThe most unexpectedly uplifting and consoling artist of the twentieth century was the abstract painter Mark Rothko, the high priest of grief and loss, who spent the latter part of his career turning out a succession of sublime and somber canvases that spoke, as he put it, of the \u201ctragedy of being human\u201d and who in 1970, at the age of sixty-six, committed suicide in his studio in New York by overdosing on barbiturates and slitting an artery in his right arm.\n\nBorn in Dvinsk, Russia, Rothko emigrated to the United States at the age of ten and immediately grew to despise the aggressive good cheer and steely optimism of his adopted land. He was a latter-day Leopardi or Pascal adrift in Disney World. Appalled by the sentimentality around him, he learned to make art that was insular, unrelenting, and oriented toward pain. It was, one critic said, the visual equivalent of a condemned prisoner\u2019s last gasp. Rothko\u2019s favorite colors were a burnt burgundy, dark gray, pitch black, and blood red, occasionally alleviated by a sliver of yellow.\n\nIn 1958, Rothko was offered a large sum to paint some murals for a soon-to-be-opened opulent New York restaurant, the Four Seasons, in the Seagram Building on Park Avenue. It was, as he put it, \u201ca place where the richest bastards of New York will come to feed and show off.\u201d His intentions for them soon became clear: \u2018I hope to ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats in that room.\u2019 And to that end, he set to work on some large black and maroon color fields expressing a mood of terror and archaic anguish. It was an unlikely commission for Rothko to have accepted, but it became ever more so in his mind when, following a trip to Italy, where he had been much moved by Giotto\u2019s renditions of the crucifixion, in the fall of 1959 he took his wife, Mell, to the restaurant for lunch. His hatred became overwhelming. Believing it was \u201ccriminal to spend more than $5 on a meal,\u201d he couldn\u2019t get over the overpriced dishes, the fancy sauces and the ponderous waiting staff. \u201cAnybody who will eat that kind of food for those kind of prices will never look at a painting of mine,\u201d he vowed. But he hated the clientele even more: suntanned, cheery rich people, out to celebrate and show themselves off, to cut deals and swap gossip, the apparent winners of life, the kind who invested in tennis lessons and whitened their teeth. His hatred of them had its roots in his sense that we only accede to our humanity when we face pain and commune around it with compassion and humility. Anything else is grandstanding and pride. He had remained Russian in his soul.\n\nFollowing the lunch, Rothko called up his patrons, explained his feelings, and sent back the money. He then gave his paintings to London\u2019s Tate Gallery, where they were hung in a quiet, airy, contemplative, religious-seeming space that enclosed the viewer in an atmosphere of meditative mortification. The paintings remain ideal companions for visitors who drift into the gallery at their wits\u2019 end, who might be working through the loss of a partner or the ruin of their career and who need more than anything else to know that they are not alone. Rothko\u2019s art did not save his life but it will have prevented many others from taking theirs.\n\nRothko\u2019s canvases\u2014though focused on the darkness\u2014are never themselves depressing to look at because they lend our difficulties dignity and legitimacy. To bathe in their atmosphere is to gain a distinct sense of comfort, like lying in the arms of a tender person who says little other than a modest \u201cI know\u201d in response to our dejection and loss. With Rothko as our guide, it matters a little less that the world is mostly filled with noisy, brash, apparent winners, that no one much cares for us, that we have failed in numberless areas, that our name isn\u2019t in lights, that we have enemies, and that we are no longer young. We are offered a refuge from the boosterish voices of contemporary society and are able to locate in an external form works that echo our own confused and inchoate sorrows.\n\nMark Rothko, Red on Maroon, 1959.\n\nA great part of our misery is caused by the cruel and erroneous assumption that life might fundamentally be a pleasant journey, capable of delivering satisfaction and delight to those who work hard and retain noble and purposeful hearts.\n\nThe truth could not be further from such a sentimental vision. Agony is baked into the human condition. We are suffering not by coincidence but by necessity. We may be focused on the particular errors and cruelties that have brought us to a low point, we may be narrowly concerned with what our enemies have done to us, how a few mistakes have cost us everything or how we have been abandoned by those who should have cared for us. But it isn\u2019t to minimize these problems to insist that they are merely local manifestations of more global and endemic troubles. They are in reality the specific mechanisms by which we have come to taste the sorrow that would\u2014however fate had twisted our path\u2014have been our lot and is the grisly birthright of every human. We must all ultimately drink the very same amount of poisoned liquid from the cup of sorrow, even if in different gulps and at different times. No one gets through unscathed.\n\nYet not only are we sad, we are isolated and lonely with our sadness, because the official narrative is remorselessly upbeat, insisting that we can find the right partner, that work can deliver satisfaction, that destinies are fair, and that there is no inherent reason for us to lament our state. However, we don\u2019t deserve\u2014on top of everything else\u2014to be forced to grin. We should be allowed to weep without being hectored into positivity. Our true overlooked right is not, after all, the right to happiness; it is the right to be miserable.\n\nThis may sound far from a reason to live, but the ability to look darkness in the face and accept its role in our affairs functions as its own very particular and intense reward. No longer must we be surprised by our suffering. No longer must we be taken unawares by misery. No longer do we have to feel that our reversals say something unique and shocking about us. We can start to rediscover a taste for life when we see that we\u2019re not alone in wanting to give up on it; that it is acceptable, even necessary, sometimes to hate the smiling \u201cbastards\u201d who so annoyed Rothko and anyone else with a heart. We can build friendships\u2014imaginative, artistic, or real\u2014around shared honesty about tragedy. We will have banked our first reason to live when we know that we aren\u2019t exceptionally stupid for finding matters very difficult. Unhappiness is just\u2014as wise artists have always liked to remind us, and despite the suggestions of all the adverts, the brochures, and the confident-seeming people congratulating themselves in the world\u2019s fancy restaurants\u2014very normal indeed.\n\n6 Grief with Agnes Martin\n\nIf there were to be a patron artist of sadness, it might be the American abstract painter Agnes Martin. Over a long life (1912\u20132004), she produced hundreds of canvases, most of them 1.8 by 1.8 meters, showing not very much at all. From a distance, they can seem merely white or gray, though step nearer and you notice grid patterns hand-drawn in pencil, beneath which run horizontal bands of color, often a particular subtle shade of gray, green, blue, or pink. There is an invitation to slough off the normal superficiality of life and bathe in the void of emptiness. The effect is soothing and moving too. For reasons to be explored, we may want to start crying. The works can appear simple but their effects are anything but. \u201cSimplicity is never simple,\u201d she explained, having studied Zen Buddhism for many years and learned that encounters with little can be frightening, because they remind us of our own ultimate nothingness, which we otherwise escape through noise and frantic and purposeless activity. \u201cSimplicity is the hardest thing to achieve, from the standpoint of the East. I\u2019m not sure the West even understands simplicity.\u201d\n\nIn the little town of Taos, in the north-central region of New Mexico, where Martin spent her last years, one can visit the Agnes Martin Gallery, an octagonal room empty except for seven of her paintings and four steel cubes by her friend and fellow minimalist artist Donald Judd. We know how far we generally drift from what is important, how often we lose ourselves in meaningless chatter or attempts to assert our interests. The paintings bid us throw aside our customary, relentless self-promotion. It is just us and the sound of our own heartbeat, the light coming in from an oculus above\u2014across which a New Mexico cloud occasionally drifts\u2014the patient work of thousands of hand-drawn grids repetitively punctuated by strips of the mildest hues of gray and pink, and the peace there would have been over the oceans when the Earth was first created. Martin once remarked that her work was fundamentally about love, not the noisy, exuberant, romantic kind, but the selfless, patient sort a parent might feel for their sleeping newborn or a gardener might experience in relation to their seedlings.\n\nAgnes Martin Gallery at the Harwood Museum in Taos, New Mexico, on March 20, 2022.\n\nThe German early twentieth-century art historian Wilhelm Worringer proposed that humanity had across history tended to make art of two kinds: abstract and realistic. On the one hand, there was an art of geometric non-concrete patterns\u2014the abstraction one might see on a Navajo rug, a Persian mosque wall, or a Peruvian basket\u2014and on the other, there was art made up of depictions of people, things and places\u2014lions in prehistoric caves, mountain landscapes, battle scenes. Worringer made an additional suggestion. What determines the sort of art a society is drawn to at a given moment is often the degree of chaos, difficulty, and struggle to which that society is subject. The more cacophonous it is, the more it tends to be attracted to the serenity and peace implied by the sober repetition of geometric patterns, just as quieter eras may seek out new vigor in bold images of mounted generals or waterfalls. We attempt to correct via art imbalances in our own emotional economy.\n\nBy implication, we shouldn\u2019t suppose that Agnes Martin was herself anything like the peaceful canvases she turned out. When still a young woman, she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffered from repeated bouts of extreme depression. She would often hear voices in her head criticizing her and urging her to take her own life. It could be hell inside her mind. It is understandable that she might as an artist have felt compelled to produce some of the most serene works the world has ever known, that she gained boundless relief from spending hours\u2014and overall decades\u2014alone in a simple house on the edge of the New Mexico desert, listening to Bach and Beethoven, tracing grids on canvases and applying paint in colors that Zen Buddhism identifies with the renunciation of the ego and the alignment of the self with cosmic harmony.\n\nAgnes Martin, Little Sister, 1962.\n\nIf we are moved, if we are tempted to start crying, it\u2019s not because our lives are themselves extremely serene. It\u2019s because\u2014like the artist herself\u2014we have for far too long been familiar with mental perturbation, because we know what it means to have inner voices insisting on our worthlessness and how right one might be to die. Martin matters because she gives dignity to a longing for something infinitely more harmonious and loving than the world can generally offer. The canvases are like a map to a destination we have lost sight of and can\u2019t get back to. They are our Ithaca. We might point to them and say that this is where we belong, this is the repository of everything we prize but have too fragile a hold on. The paintings lend us the courage to cut ourselves free from our unhealthy attachments, to say goodbye to concerns for status, to shun the pursuit of public esteem, to dismiss false friends who do us nothing but underhand harm, to accept the terror of disgrace, to reconcile ourselves to our own company, and to pursue connections with just a very few honest souls who have known struggles and been rendered kind by them. The paintings are what we could be if we sat with our own feelings and let their range course through us, if we gave up using our clever minds to ward off sadness and stopped trying to make sense of every experience, if we made our peace with mystery and the encroaching darkness that will soon subsume us.\n\nAgnes Martin, Untitled, 1974.\n\nNowadays, by the typically perverse accidents of the art market, Agnes Martin\u2019s paintings cost as much as planes. They can only generally be seen in bustling public museums. In a better world, we\u2019d all be able to own a few. As it is, we can at least spend time with them in high-quality online versions and printed reproductions. They are sad pictures, in the best of ways. They know of our troubles, they understand how much we long for tenderness yet how rough everything has been day to day, and they want us to have the simplicity of little children and the hearts of wise old people who have stopped protesting and started to welcome experience. The titles that Martin gave her paintings indicate some of what she was getting at: Loving Love, Gratitude, Friendship, and, best of all, I Love the Whole World, which implies the sort of love one experiences not when everything has been hunky-dory, but when one has after the longest time come through from the other side of agony.\n\nWe can follow the grids and be happy. There\u2019s one rectangle after another, one dot after another, nothing more troubling than lines of gray and white, no more surprises and departures, nothing unforeseen or cruel, only Martin\u2019s careful pencil, riding along the little bumps that tremble beneath unprimed canvas. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s guiding us step by step, as we might a small child or a very old person, from square to square, making the world more manageable again, reducing its strident, clattery riot to something we can ingest. She\u2019s cutting up the food of life for us into very neat and precise squares. She knows how unsteady we have felt. Occasionally, after a lot of grays, she goes for a pink, as if to hell with reserve, why not surrender to sweetness and take a risk with innocence? She\u2019s giving us a hug and inviting us to come to the window to watch a new day with her through her frame.\n\nTo those who don\u2019t see anything in her work, let\u2019s hope that life won\u2019t teach its lessons too painfully. To everyone else, her work will feel like a homecoming. We will know that someone else has understood, has been as ill and has been committed to hope, endurance, and kindness.\n\nAgnes Martin, Starlight, 1963.\n\n7 Cakes and Happiness\n\nWayne Thiebaud isn\u2019t being sarcastic or elaborately sly. This isn\u2019t a sophisticated mockery of ordinary appetites, or a nod to pop art\u2014a movement he disliked. He just deeply adored confectionery. His mother had been a great baker and he was an excellent cook himself. When he went to Paris, his first destinations were not the Louvre or the Jeu de Paume, but Stohrer and Angelina\u2019s\u2014and his favorite works were not Rembrandts and Van Goghs, but canel\u00e9s and brioches, eclairs and roses des sables. Across a long career, he painted German chocolate cakes and king cakes, devil\u2019s food cake and baked Alaskas. He took us into the delights of buckeyes and Indiana sugar cream pies, banana puddings and snickerdoodles. In his 1963 Cakes, his precise, frank brushwork conjured up meringue and cream, icing sugar and melted chocolate.\n\nWhen lying on our deathbeds, there will really be only two lovely things we will wish we had had more of. The other one is cakes. Our large and sophisticated brains do us a disservice when they lead us to forget how much the principal pleasures of life do not originate in their folds and downplay how much fun will ultimately need to come from elsewhere.\n\nWayne Thiebaud, Cakes, 1963.\n\nWe are understandably wary of \u201cescapism.\u201d We like our pleasures to be allied to grand, rationally founded, and enduring schemes: marriage and professional advancement, children and local politics. It appears demeaning to ask confectionery to provide us with one of the central constituents of the meaning of existence. But we should not fool ourselves. Most of what we scheme for in our clever minds will not come off; most of our sober larger hopes will not be realized. Friends will let us down, love will disappoint us, careers will go off at half-cock.\n\nThiebaud\u2019s art knows as much\u2014and our stomachs concur. It is a superior form of intelligence to know the limits of intelligence; part of good thinking involves knowing when to stop thinking. To overlook the role of mille-feuilles and strawberry tartlets in underpinning contentment is a cold-hearted and senseless mistake. Great artists have always remembered to celebrate the real reasons to keep living.\n\n8 Seizing Melons\n\nBetween 1973 and 1979, Stephen Shore made six trips across the United States, clocking up tens of thousands of miles along the way. What the photographer wanted to find and capture through his lens was nothing less than the idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d in all its troubled glory, alienation, beauty, and horror. There were to be hundreds of pictures, many of them iconic and known even to those who have made no effort to know them.\n\nBut perhaps his most resonant image was taken by chance in the tiny town of Kanab in southern Utah in a diner\u2014it still exists\u2014early one summer morning in 1973. Sitting in the Trail\u2019s End Restaurant contemplating his just-arrived order of a plate of stacked pancakes lathered with foamy butter, a brim-full glass of cold milk, and half a shiny cantaloupe melon, Shore was struck by the sheer beauty and ecstasy of it all and, in a state of delight, with the manager\u2019s permission, stood up on a chair, pointed his 35mm Leica downward and captured an enduring testament to the sensory pleasures of life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel coincidental that Shore was on a long journey and that he was in search of something large and intangible. In this respect, most of us are a version of him\u2014though our destinations have names like \u201ccontentment\u201d and \u201cachievement.\u201d We dream of reaching a promised land where anxiety, restless questioning, and uncertainty will be at an end.\n\nStephen Shore, Breakfast, Trail\u2019s End Restaurant, Kanab, Utah, August 10, 1973, 1973.\n\nBut we will, of course, never arrive. There is no true destination and there is definitely no end point. All there is is the journey\u2014an idea which, though it has its tragic dimension, liberates us to make more of the true valuable increments of life: moments.\n\nWithout any promised land, there will be unexpected moments of pure joy, instances of total, albeit fleeting, wonder. Our happiness must be counted in minutes, not years. But when those moments sneak up on us, we should be wise and old enough to embrace them as avidly as a child might, pushing back our chair, beholding them with awe and fixing them in our memory for ever.\n\n9 Wise Cows\n\nThe mountains weren\u2019t made to deliver a message to us. No one created them to articulate a philosophy. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t exceptionally well placed to do so\u2014especially when framed through the talent of the Swiss artist Ferdinand Hodler, one of the greatest painters of any place and of any age.\n\nWe\u2019re looking up at the seven interconnected peaks of the Dents du Midi range, which rises in an almost sheer vertical up to 3,000 meters from the fertile valley floor of Switzerland\u2019s Valais region, creating an astonishing, impassable wall of granite capped for six months of the year with layers of ice and snow visited only by the occasional griffon vulture and marmot.\n\nSo much of our upset stems from being belittled by a world that refuses to accord us the respect and recognition we know should be our due. One way to appease our bruised sense of importance is to be made to feel small with definitive and magisterial force by something obviously mightier than any human. Our sense that we have been overlooked and treated badly by our fellow citizens can be subsumed by an impression of how petty and insignificant all our society\u2019s endeavors are next to the indomitable forces of nature, of which the peaks, created 60 million years ago by the titanic rippling of the Earth\u2019s crust in the continental collision, are an especially impressive symbol. It matters ever so slightly less, in the shadow of the peaks, that our projects were rejected and our reputation sullied, that we have recently rowed bitterly with our partner and been misunderstood by so-called friends.\n\nThe real stars of Hodler\u2019s painting among his last; he died two years later\u2014are not the mountains at all, but the three clever cows that he has carefully observed on the edge of a field. They care nothing for us and\u2014with equal boldness\u2014nothing for the spectacular scenery either. They are exclusively focused on finding their next mouthful of grass and enjoying the warming rays of the August sun. The follies that agitate us have no analogies in their hearts. They are not scholars or monks but, through the good fortune of their biological makeup, have already reached the state of benign indifference and serene acceptance of fate that the wisest of humans struggle to attain after a lifetime of devoted effort.\n\nFerdinand Hodler, The Dents du Midi from Champ\u00e9ry, 1916.\n\n10 Healing Love\n\nThere\u2019s some kind of story going on, a very lovely one, but we can\u2019t know the details for certain. We are, in this respect, standing outside a window ourselves\u2014in the most agreeable of ways. What we can guess with some accuracy is that the relationship is an extremely kindly and tender one. This is Granny, Mommy, Nanny, or Auntie\u2014and just beyond the window, through those thin, delicate panes of seventeenth-century Dutch glass, there is little Maries, Annelies, Sofie, or Wilma. Maybe it\u2019s a game: I\u2019ll run outside and wave to you and your job is to wave back. Or: You cover your eyes, I\u2019ll duck beneath the window, give a little tap and then you have to rush to spot me before I drop down again. Or, more simply: When I have to go home after a day with you, I miss you so much and I like to say goodbye many times, four times in the room, twice from the hallway and then once again at the window.\n\nIn other words, in some undefined way, this is a portrait of love. An adult, probably quite a serious one who has known many cares and has considerable responsibilities, is bending to the sweet and imaginative will of a small person, in whose reflection she sees a version of herself. Vrel hints that the window is a mirror: the old woman gazing at a version of her younger self. A grown-up who could so easily have humiliated the child\u2014said she was busy or that it was all too silly\u2014is joining in enthusiastically and giving the ritual or game her all, to the extent that she might even fall off her chair.\n\nJacob Vrel, Woman at a Window, Waving at a Girl, c. 1650.\n\nOne of the unexpected origins of something as serious and consequential as adult mental health arguably begins right here. If we find ourselves as grown-ups feeling creative, knowing how to appreciate ourselves, understanding how to remain calm, and ready to give affection to others, it is almost certainly because at some point, a long way back, someone did for us what the woman in Vrel\u2019s painting is doing for the little girl: gave us attention, made us the focus of tenderness, appreciated us on our own modest but vital terms.\n\nChildren who end up sane have been spared the need to be very good or very reasonable too early. We can\u2019t know much about the economic status of Vrel\u2019s figures. What we do know is that such games and the love behind them belong to what it really means to have had that most invaluable of things: a privileged childhood.\n\n11 I\u2019m Not Getting in the Car\n\nIt was the summer of 1963 and Joel Meyerowitz was walking the streets of New York City with his M10 when, on the Upper East Side, somewhere around 76th and Madison, he came across a girl whose name we will never know having one of the worst mornings of her young life. The wails resounded all around the brownstones. No, she wasn\u2019t getting in. No, she didn\u2019t care about what the time was. No, she wasn\u2019t going to listen. No, no, no.\n\nPart of what makes young children\u2019s lives so difficult is that they have extremely powerful antipathies, worries, loves, and dreads that make no immediate sense to grown-ups because children lack the language or wherewithal to be able to explain them with requisite adequacy. Their feelings are an outgrowth of the manic sensitivity, unconfined intelligence, and wild imagination of the infantile mind. Small people are, in the best and most inspiring of ways, slightly mad.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that perhaps the girl doesn\u2019t want to get inside because she really doesn\u2019t like the way the car looks. She hates the dark orange paintwork of its upper body; it reminds her of the color of a house she once had to go into where another girl said something extremely mean to her about her hair. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t want to get inside because the driver makes an odd noise when he swallows or because there\u2019s a strange smell in the toilets at school or because she\u2019s been forbidden from taking her soft rabbit with her and she doesn\u2019t want Floppy to spend all day alone with Maria in the apartment staring at the wall and getting bored. But because all this is so hard to explain, most children simply end up screaming, then being labeled \u201cspoilt\u201d or \u201cdifficult.\u201d\n\nThe child and the artist are in a sense in a very similar predicament: both are uncommonly sensitive, both notice and are marked by \u201csmall things\u201d that it\u2019s easy to overlook or denigrate. Both might spend an age looking at a sidewalk, a flower, or a conker. But artists are in a luckier position: They can bring to the sensitivities of a child the powers of communication of a robust and ingenious adult. They can turn their tears into pictures and essays.\n\nWith their examples in mind, we should strive not so much to become less sensitive as to grow better able to convey what we are sensitive about, so that we will have a slightly better chance of being understood even by people who are in a very great hurry to get us into the car.\n\nJoel Meyerowitz, New York City, 1963.\n\n12 What Remains\n\nShe should, it seems, have so little to be happy about. She\u2019s only got a few months left to live, she had to sell her bungalow after the diagnosis, both of her knees are giving her trouble, she can\u2019t hear anything in her left ear, she\u2019s seen too many of her close friends die. And yet, extraordinarily, she is smiling.\n\nFurthermore, though it sounds strange, she\u2019s happier now than she was a while ago, when she ostensibly had so much more to feel happy about, when she could run and hear a pin drop. She\u2019s certainly happier than she was at twenty, when she was deciding between Vincent and Albert; or when she was forty, and the kids were teenagers; or after the marriage fell apart and she moved to a small place outside Lille on her own.\n\nAll the worries have faded into the background. She is living\u2014as certain Eastern sages have always recommended\u2014entirely in the present. She doesn\u2019t look much beyond tomorrow. She is surprised and amazed to have made it until the spring. She studies everything with patience and wonder. How extraordinary a rose is, she thinks, with the glee of a young child\u2014one of the nurses brought it for her after her daughter mentioned the garden she had left behind. She had never been too interested in flowers until she was sixty. Then they started to matter a lot. By that time, all her larger aspirations had faded; she knew full well about the gap between her hopes and the available realities. So then flowers were no longer an insult to ambition, but a genuine pleasure amid a litany of troubles, a small resting place for hope in a turbulent sea of disappointment.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t care about the so-called big things any more. When the politicians argue on television, she looks away. She has seen so many babies turn into old men, and brilliant young things fade into nothing. She doesn\u2019t worry about what will happen to the planet or get excited about what the scientists might discover. If you visit her, she just wants to know how you are and whether you might be cold or after something to drink. She\u2019s happy that you exist and that she can put her hand on yours.\n\nIn the end, all we will care about will be kindness. We should\u2014with the help of the right art\u2014learn a little ahead of time.\n\nMartine Franck, \u201cMaison de Nanterre,\u201d Old People\u2019s Home, Hauts de Seine, France, 1978.\n\n13 Hockney\u2019s First Day\n\nIn 1963, the Sunday Times sent the already much celebrated 26-year-old artist David Hockney to Egypt on an assignment to record the great monuments of antiquity: the pyramids outside Cairo, the temples at Luxor and Karnak, and the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Egypt astonished Hockney and induced in him a state of almost perpetual creativity where everything seemed to hold a secret, everything was worthy of investigation and reflection. He sketched on whatever was to hand: old envelopes, hotel room notepaper, and the inside covers of his books. However, what struck him most were not the obvious tourist destinations so much as the details of ordinary Egyptian life: the watch of the man at reception, the sandals of the newspaper seller, the signs for the dry cleaner, and the television repair shop.\n\nOn arrival in Alexandria, Hockney sat on the terrace of the Hotel Cecil and very carefully drew the label on a bottle of local mineral water from the El Natroon valley and a packet of cigarettes. In its delicacy and observational precision\u2014Hockney knew no Arabic\u2014this astonishing study of a bottle might be an emblem of what it means to be properly attuned to a place: to put aside our usual cares and surrender to the interest and beauty of the world, as a child might, as artists will\u2014and as we almost never do.\n\nDavid Hockney, Waiter, Alexandria, 1963.\n\nGenerally, we tend to notice nothing, but we may make an exception for one particular time and place: the first day in a new destination. There and then, for once, we too may be shaken from our customary lethargy. Everything leaps out at us: how peculiar the taxis are, the smells in the street, the sound of passers-by, the clothes of the old. Our eyes open properly, as they last did when we were two years old and it took us half an hour to get home from the park because there was so much for us to study on the way.\n\nThis state is unlikely to last long. After a few days, we usually go back to our habitual blindness. But even if we manage it for only a short while, the receptivity of that first day remains a possibility that we should strive to enact more regularly and generously, even in places closer to home. We shouldn\u2019t need another continent to start to appreciate the texture of existence. We knew how to do so as a small one and we might do so again. Artists are in this context only the emissaries of an appropriately appreciative relationship to the world of which we are all in theory capable.\n\nOur travels have an overwhelming lesson to teach us: that we need whenever we can to try to look at our lives, with which it is so easy to get dispirited and about which it is so forgivable to despair, as though we were still in some ways on that hopeful, endlessly fascinating first day somewhere else, when even a label on a bottle of water has something important to whisper to us.\n\n14 The Greatest Artist\n\nThis is a self-portrait by one of the greatest artists of the twenty-first century, a car-shaped contraption named Curiosity which has been moving around at a glacial pace\u2014it would take an hour for it to complete a hundred-meter sprint over the surface of Mars since its bumpy landing there in a cloud of dust on August 6, 2012, following a 560-million-kilometer journey from Earth.\n\nCuriosity has ostensibly come to Mars in order to find out more about the planet\u2019s biological and geochemical properties. It\u2019s been trying to understand Mars\u2019s organic carbon compounds; it\u2019s been figuring out the relative proportions of sulfur, carbon, hydrogen, and phosphorus in the atmosphere. It\u2019s been mapping isotopic composition and measuring the spectrum of radiation, with a special interest in secondary neutrons and solar proton events.\n\nBut regardless of the stated purpose, what Curiosity has really been trying to do is to help our marriages, calm our anger with our colleagues, appease our disappointments, and bolster our capacities for calm and perspective. No one can look at any of the images it has sent back without a sense of awe that at once relativizes everything petty and regrettable that agitates and demeans us day to day. What can it possibly matter who said what to whom and in what tone of voice given that Curiosity has captured the sun going down at six in the evening below the rim of Gale Crater? Or that its mast camera has just sent thirty-two individual images that it has assembled into a panorama of a Martian outcrop nicknamed Mont Mercou?\n\nCuriosity self-portrait at \u201cGlen Etive\u201d site, 2019.\n\nThe machine also reminds us of the beauty of our own planet. The bleakness of Mars emphasizes the lushness of our own world. Pictures of this far-off place we will probably never go to ourselves can inspire wonder and gratitude for where we are already.\n\nLike all great artists, and with comparable technical ingenuity, Curiosity has attempted to help us change our lives, away from superficiality and bitterness toward goodness, wisdom, and truth.",

      "content": "## IV : Freedom\n\nThere are few more emotive or beguiling words than \u201cfreedom.\u201d Even without examining it very closely, and perhaps especially then, the term tends to evoke something especially honorable, enticing, and good, of which we would always want more and could never stand to be deprived.\n\nIn our societies, the word has been especially resonant at the collective level, so much so that when we nowadays think of freedom, it is first and foremost political freedom that we might have in mind. It\u2019s in the name of political freedom that millions have marched, chanted, and risked their lives in demonstrations and struggles over the centuries: in Paris in 1789 and Bucharest in 1877, in Lima\u2019s Plaza Mayor in 1885 and Leipzig\u2019s Karl-Marx-Platz in 1989.\n\nThe freedom that we can, in certain parts of the world, now take for granted\u2014the right to own property, to express negative opinions about the government, and to live without fear of arbitrary arrest\u2014is the result of five hundred years of fearless effort on the part of the defenders of liberty. It is because, in the cities of northern Italy and the Low Countries, medieval merchants rose up against their tyrannical feudal overlords, because seventeenth-century political theorists carefully took apart the claims of absolutist monarchies, and because groups of determined students in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Europe refused to kowtow to the rule of dictators that we can nowadays lob sarcastic remarks at our mediocre rulers and look at the security forces without fear.\n\nBut if politicians know that they can always be sure of drawing a powerful response from their audiences by brandishing the word \u201cfreedom\u201d\u2014and labeling their opponents as its enemies\u2014it is in part on the basis of a subtle emotional sleight of hand. We are open to being mobilized by a promise of freedom in politics because it is a quality that, even if only in a semiconscious way, we long for in our personal and psychological lives.\n\nEven when, at the level of the state, we have all the freedoms we need, we may lack freedom of the spirit. We might be free but not feel free. Without there being any formal chains around us, we may have an impression of being hemmed in or uncomfortably observed. We may be afraid of departing from convention and of doing things that our friends or people we went to school with wouldn\u2019t approve of. A sense of inward freedom turns out to be in its own way even more complicated than political freedom\u2014and its enemies more subtle.\n\nWere we to draw up a charter of what we can call psychological freedom, we might need to include some of the following constituents:\n\nfreedom from fear of judgment\n\nfreedom from the weight of public opinion\n\nfreedom from society\u2019s ideas of normality\n\nfreedom from society\u2019s definitions of a good relationship\n\nfreedom from standard beliefs about status\n\nfreedom from expected consumption patterns\n\nfreedom from fashionable opinions\n\nfreedom from the pressure to be normal, ambitious, or optimistic\n\nAll these will contribute, in their absence, to much more elusive forms of enmeshment than those we know in the political sphere. The prohibitions are much harder to track\u2014and the forms of suffering they generate more insidious in their effects.\n\nWe lack the iron-clad reliable vocabulary open to those who seek to defend political freedoms. We know the importance of \u201cfreedom from arbitrary arrest\u201d; we\u2019re still at the dawn of appreciating what it might mean to be free enough not to consult social media or to resist the pressure to parrot fashionable opinions\u2014let alone take off for a hut in the woods, flout the latest shibboleth on relationships, or never go to another party again.\n\nWe are still feeling our way to an understanding of what a genuinely free life would be like: what we could refuse, who we could stop listening to, what we could dare to focus on if we were brave enough to take our own consciences and sensations as our lodestars. We may remain, in our hearts, every bit as unfree as an unbeliever in a totalitarian religious regime or a dissident under observation of the state apparatus. We can be no less fearful, our choices just as constrained, our ability to roam as we would wish equally compromised.\n\nWe have been fighting for liberty from state control for centuries. The quest now is to identify and then more robustly hold on to the key ingredients of psychological freedom. For this, we need humbly to accept how still relatively unfamiliar we might be with the idea of being free in and of ourselves. We should concede that shackles and obedience come to us far more readily than do indiscipline and the solitary path. Though we may flatter ourselves through identification with lone rebels and renegades, we are by nature docile, pliable, accommodating herd animals with a ready appetite to go meekly wherever our shepherds might dictate.\n\nWe need\u2014though the phrase may sound peculiar\u2014to learn to be free, to rid ourselves of the invisible hierarchies in our minds and the fears bequeathed to us by our histories. We need to lean on examples of once-timid people who grew into themselves, discern the bars of our cages, and properly identify who and what is wasting what remains of our years. We may have loved the idea of freedom for a long time already; now come the challenge and opportunity of leading a life that is truly our own.\n\n1 Sonnet 29 and Failure\n\nWhen, in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast state,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,And look upon myself and curse my fate,Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,Desiring this man\u2019s art and that man\u2019s scope,With what I most enjoy contented least;Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,Haply I think on thee, and then my state,(Like to the lark at break of day arisingFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate;\n\nFor thy sweet love remembered such wealth bringsThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\nSonnet 29, written around 1592, finds William Shakespeare, then in his late twenties, in a highly fragile state. He is worried about failure. He is contemplating a future in which he will be a social pariah, his mention enough to provoke revulsion. He will be in agony, pondering his stupidity and bad luck. He will lament that he can\u2019t practice the job he most enjoys\u2014and he will look around and feel desperation and envy of all those who remain so much more successful than he is and who will still enjoy esteem and their good name.\n\nIt is, of course, a paradox that the most acclaimed writer in English literature should have worried so acutely about failure; that he should have been so like us in fearing that he would one day\u2014through a mixture of his own idiocy and unfortunate outside events\u2014be a disgraced nobody. Then again, \u201cgreatness\u201d in literature doesn\u2019t come from living pompously among high-flown abstractions; great writers are ultimately simply those who know how to speak with special honesty about the panic and sadness of an ordinary life.\n\nWhat had brought Shakespeare to this anxious, vigilant state? Why was he so afraid he was going to lose it all? Partly, it was because he was not yet very well established. He\u2019d written only Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI. In the coming years, he would write\u2014in quick succession\u2014A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night. But as yet these would have been mere sketches in his mind. There was another problem. Shakespeare had a famous and very vicious enemy who was spreading rumors about him and seemed determined to bring him down. He was a fellow playwright called Robert Greene.\n\nGreene loathed Shakespeare. He wrote an open letter warning that \u201cThere is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers heart wrapt in a Players hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you.\u201d He nicknamed him \u201cShakescene\u201d that is, a show-off and a popularizing fool\u2014and, to further rub in how untalented he was, a jack of all trades or \u201cJohannes Factotum.\u201d In different circumstances but with equal unfairness, we all have Robert Greenes around us. The world abounds in them and makes life a good deal more terrifying and nasty than it should be.\n\nThe London theater world was small, mean, and very gossipy. This kind of review from a respected playwright was intended to damage and it would have done huge harm. One can imagine Shakespeare, still young and finding his feet in the capital, panicking at how bad the sniping was getting, worrying that such insults would never stop, knowing how many people had had a mean laugh at his expense, fearful that his good intentions would never surface and that he would for ever be known as a cheap, unscrupulous idiot.\n\nFurthermore, the bubonic plague had returned, as it did continually to England in the Elizabethan age. The year before Shakespeare\u2019s birth, an outbreak had killed 80,000 and now it was back. Between August 1592 and January 1593, 20,000 people died in the southeast of England, 15,000 of them in London. There was rioting in the streets and Queen Elizabeth moved out to Windsor Castle for her safety. The government shut down all pubs and theatres for six months. Every actor and playwright was out of work. Not only was his name being trashed, Shakespeare was facing financial ruin.\n\nHow to bear the terror of failure? With Shakespeare as our guide, though the impulse may be to turn away from fear, what can calm us down is to sit with what scares us most. We should dare to investigate the terrifying scenario so as to drain it of its strangeness and stop apprehending it only through the corners of our eyes in shame. Shakespeare openly meditates on what might happen: He pictures the worst that could unfold in order to see how it might be borne. He also renders himself cathartically vulnerable in the process; he makes no bones about his suffering to us in the future and, we can imagine, to the people more immediately around him. He is going to admit just how bad things are for him in order to break his isolation and sense of unacceptability. He will try to universalize what could otherwise feel like only a very personal and embarrassing affliction. He will dare to see if anyone else has ever suffered as he has\u2014and hold out an imaginary hand of friendship to all his readers, as writers will.\n\nBut then comes the core of the consoling process. He recognizes implicitly that what is driving his wish to be successful is the desire to be respected and liked. It might be money and fame that he is drawn to, but beneath these there is another hunger: to be treated well and to avoid humiliation. There is a quest for love hiding within the drive to be somebody. Once that idea is established, a deeply redemptive maneuver comes into view. We don\u2019t actually ever need the whole of society to love us. We don\u2019t have to have everyone on our side. Let the Robert Greenes of this world\u2014and their many successors in newspapers, living rooms, and social media down the ages\u2014say their very worst and nastiest things and be done with them. All that we need is the love of a few friends or even just one special person and we can survive.\n\nThe love of a single sensitive and intelligent being can compensate us for the loss of love from the world and with such a gift we can, as Shakespeare says, be in a better place than \u201ckings.\u201d Popular success is an unreliable goal, at the mercy of fickle fortune. There are so many jealous people and we are prone to make mistakes that they can use to bring us down. What we must therefore try to do is cultivate\u2014and look forward to leaning on\u2014the affection and regard of sympathetic companions. Others may be scoffing, others may sneer every time our name comes up in conversation, but we will be secure. We will be somewhere far from the gossipy and plague-ridden city, living quietly with those who properly know us and for whom we won\u2019t need to do anything more to deserve a place in their hearts.\n\nShakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 29 has been prized for four centuries because it latches on with such sincerity to an anxiety that afflicts us all\u2014and proposes a solution that we know must be correct. In the end, things may turn out all right: the plague may recede, business may pick up, the rumor mill may die down and leave us alone. But if none of this happens, if it does all go wrong and we become a definitive byword for awfulness, then in our moments of high anxiety, especially late at night, we should know the fallback: a few generous, sincere, emotionally mature souls who know about forgiveness and kindness, sympathy and charity, who won\u2019t reduce us to one horrid nickname, who will love us with the complex regard that a parent might bestow on a child or a god on its creations. Love will redeem us. We may well fail, but we don\u2019t need to fear it will be hell\u2014and so we can afford to approach challenges with a little more freedom and light-heartedness. The cleverest and most humane writer who ever lived knew as much; in our panic we should trust him.\n\n2 How to Live in a Hut\n\nThere\u2019s a dread that we normally keep at the far edges of our minds but that occasionally\u2014particularly at three o\u2019clock on a restless night floods our thoughts: If we don\u2019t constantly strive to achieve, if we slip up, or if some new catastrophe strikes the economy, we\u2019ll lose pretty much everything and we\u2019ll end up having to live in a caravan, a tiny one-room apartment or\u2014God forbid\u2014a hut in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe bleakness of this image spurs us to ever more frantic efforts. We\u2019d settle for almost anything to avoid it: oppressively long working hours; a job that holds no interest; risky money-making schemes; a loveless marriage that keeps us in the family home; or, maybe, decades of suffering the whims of a grim relative for the prospect of an inheritance. The hut is a symbol of disaster and humiliation.\n\nIt\u2019s in this fear-laden context that we might consider the case of a man called Kamo no Chomei, who was born in Japan around 1155. His father was the well-to-do head of a prominent religious shrine near Kyoto, which was then the capital, and Chomei grew up in luxurious circumstances. He received a refined education and in the early part of his adult life had an elegant social circle. When he was still in his twenties, his grandmother left him a big house and his future looked bright. But then it all started to go wrong. He made enemies and was sidelined in his career; he got into financial difficulties and, by the time he was fifty, he had alienated his former friends, had practically no money left\u2014and was going bald.\n\nChomei was forced to reform his existence and survive on the most slender material base. Far out in the country, where no one else wanted to live, he built himself a tiny hut\u2014just ten feet by ten. It was, he reflected, one hundredth of the size of the mansion in which he\u2019d grown up. It wasn\u2019t even a permanent structure; his situation was so precarious he had to ensure that his home could be dismantled and carted away.\n\nA modern reconstruction shows just how small and basic it was, but doesn\u2019t convey its isolated position in the hills at Toyama, which was considered the back of beyond. Rotting leaves collected on the roof, moss grew on the floor, and the water supply was just a rickety bamboo pipe leading from a nearby stream to a little pool by the door. Chomei cooked outside, though eventually he rigged up a small awning to keep the rain off in wet weather. He slept on a pile of bracken on the floor, he had no furniture, and he lived mainly on nuts, berries, and wild root vegetables which he foraged from the woods\u2014and quite often he went hungry. The only people he saw were a family of peasants who lived at the foot of the hill whom his former grand friends would have dismissed as lowly rustics. He could afford only clothes made from the coarsest cloth and they soon became mere rags, leaving him indistinguishable from the beggars he used to see in the city. It was here, in this way, that Chomei lived for fifteen years, up to his death in his mid-sixties.\n\nKawai Shrine within the Shimogamo Shrine, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, Kinki Region, Japan.\n\nIt was also here that he wrote a short book, The Ten Square Foot Hut, one of the great masterpieces of Japanese literature. It\u2019s not\u2014as we might expect\u2014a lament, poring over the misfortunes and betrayals that led him to this degraded condition. Instead it\u2019s full of good cheer, happiness, and pleasure. The most touching line in the whole of the essay is the simple affirmation: \u201cI love my little hut, my simple dwelling.\u201d\n\nWhat, we can ask, was it that enabled Chomei to find fulfillment in such an apparently unpromising place? It wasn\u2019t that he was naturally drawn to a minimal material life: No one who\u2019d known him earlier, in his days of prosperity, would have imagined that he could thrive under such circumstances\u2014least of all himself. He wasn\u2019t someone who for years had been hankering after the simple life. He moved to the hut in desperation and against his inclinations; it was only once he was there that he discovered that he liked it\u2014that it was in fact his ideal home.\n\nChomei was guided by a distinctive philosophy. And this is a principle of hope, for we can\u2019t magically take on another individual\u2019s personality but we can understand, and perhaps come to share, their ideas. Temperament may be fixed but philosophy is transferable. From his book, we can identify four crucial ideas that together transformed what could have been a purely grim experience into one of deep and tranquil satisfaction.",

      "content": "## BEAUTY IS VERY IMPORTANT\n\nThis might seem a strange place to start because normally beauty looks like the outcome of immense wealth: elegant possessions, a gracious home, and trips to Venice and St Petersburg. But these expensive things are just the most obvious instances of beauty. As our tastes become more sensitive and our imaginations more expansive, the link with money falls away\u2014because a great many truly lovely sights are readily available almost everywhere to those who know how to look.\n\nAround his modest home, Chomei\u2014with a sensitive eye\u2014discovered endless sources of beauty: fall leaves, fruit trees in blossom, melting snow, the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the rain beating down on the roof. All were free. He was entranced by flowers: \u201cIn spring I gaze upon swathes of wisteria that hang shining in the west, like the purple clouds that bear the soul to heaven.\u201d He found a delightful spot on the hillside: \u201cIf the day is fine I look out over Mount Kohata, Fushimi Village, Toba and Hatsukashi\u201d and \u201cat night, the fireflies in the nearby grass blend their little lights with the fires the fishermen make at distant Makinoshima: no one owns a splendid view.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s partly the idea of having to cope with constant ugliness that makes a lower-level economic life so frightening. Chomei\u2019s antidote is to stress the continuing opportunities for visual delight, even on the most minimal of incomes.",

We tend to have a highly concrete and detailed sense of accounting around finances, while time invisibly slips away.\n\nChomei, on the contrary, had a keen sense of the value of his own time, without interruptions, impediments or duties: \u201cI can choose to rest and laze as I wish, there is no one to stand in my way or to shame me for my idleness.\u201d\n\nHe had time to practice playing the lute, or biwa : \u201cmy skills are poor,\u201d he admitted\u2014but then he had no audience, he wasn\u2019t trying to please or impress anyone. \u201cI play music, I sing alone, simply for my own fulfillment.\u201d\n\nHe read and reread the same few favorite books, which he came to know almost by heart. He had time to reflect and to write. He meditated, took long walks, and spent a lot of time contemplating the moon.\n\nHis activities were self-directed: He did them simply because he found them enjoyable, not because anyone had asked him or because they were expected of a civilized individual. And he had this luxury only because he had disregarded the nexus of money and the pursuit of status which is so closely connected to it.\n\nTheoretically Chomei could have found a job, however lowly. But he preferred to cut his expenses down to zero in the name of something truly valuable: his time.",

      "content": "## EVERYTHING IS TRANSIENT\n\nChomei opens his book with a metaphor comparing human life to a river: \u201cOn flows the river ceaselessly, nor does the water ever stay the same. The bubbles that float upon its pools now disappear, now form anew, but never endure long. And so it is with people in this world, and with their dwellings.\u201d He\u2019s reminding himself\u2014and us\u2014of the half-terrifying, half-consoling fact that our existence and all our pleasures and troubles are fleeting.\n\nBecause our lives are so brief it is the quality of our experiences, rather than the extent of our possessions, that matters. The more things we own, the more we are exposed to random misfortune: A fashionable home will soon be dated; our prestige in the eyes of others will fluctuate for trivial reasons; we might build a palace and die before it is completed; and the monuments we hope will allow our names to last get misinterpreted or torn down. The simple hut makes an accommodation with impermanence: It might get blown down in a storm or washed away in a flood, officials might arrive at our door and tell us we have to leave, but our needs have been pared down so much that chance has less to work on.\n\n\u201cWORLDLY\u201d PEOPLE ARE LESS HAPPY THAN THEY SEEM\n\nA thought that erodes our willingness to live a simpler life\u2014in a hut, if need be\u2014is the haunting fear that other people are having a wonderful time. Perhaps we could manage to get by, but we\u2019d always be conscious of how much we were missing out on.\n\nChomei continually reminded himself that a \u201cworldly\u201d life\u2014which in his early and middle years he knew intimately\u2014carries a heavy load of limitations, defects, and sorrows. The life of the well-to-do is less enviable than it outwardly seems. The fashionable world is full of what he called \u201ccringing\u201d: \u201cYou worry over your least action; you cannot be authentic in your grief or your joy.\u201d In high society, it is always paramount to consider how any opinion will be judged by the other members of the social beehive. Envy is widespread and there is perpetual anxiety around losing status\u2014which takes the satisfaction out of prosperity: \u201cwithout a peaceful mind, palaces and fine houses mean nothing.\u201d\n\nChomei\u2019s aim wasn\u2019t to disparage the rich. \u201cI am simply comparing my past, worldly life with my present one,\u201d he wrote, and added that the balance of pleasures and contentment was distinctly in favor of the latter. What he had been denied wasn\u2019t, on examination, worth regretting.\n\nChomei is showing us that it\u2019s possible to live in materially minimal conditions while being good-humored, ambitious, and in search of true fulfillment. He is dismantling our fear that material modesty has to mean degradation and squalor. We can, if we embrace his ideas, live more simply anywhere, including a hut, should we have to. And in the meantime, as we now know, we do not need to be so afraid.\n\n3 Become an Aristocrat\n\nAristocrats are, of course, a faintly ridiculous proposition: They wear tweedy clothes; they speak with improbable accents; they have odd-sounding, often very long names; they bury themselves in the depths of the country on estates that have been in their families for generations, devoting themselves to the slaughter of foxes and grouse; they are low on talent and ill-equipped for competition in a meritocratic society.\n\nBut they have one very enviable merit: They are utterly indifferent to popular opinion. It never occurs to them to worry whether what they care about will get a fair hearing in the media. They accept that they belong to a radical minority and it would be absurd to imagine that the average person would know about, let alone be sympathetic to, their world. This gives them the strength to approach the media with light-hearted indifference. They don\u2019t blame or even dislike the popular press for not understanding them\u2014it\u2019s entirely inevitable. The vast majority of the population are, in their eyes, simply unfortunate people who at some level mean well but can\u2019t conceivably have opinions worth taking too seriously. Aristocrats are not politically anti-democratic but something quite different and more intriguing: They are psychologically above popular opinion.\n\nWe might rather wish we could share some of their unconcern, but how can we who lack castles and long lines of fancy ancestors possibly have access to this elevated and blithe state of mind?\n\nThe dilemma received one intriguing answer in France in the nineteenth century. Traditionally, aristocrats had been defined by their huge economic and political power. But in the Revolution of 1789, many of them lost their heads and even more lost their money, so a new definition started to be explored. A pivotal figure in this was the novelist and essayist Jules Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly, who was born in 1808 into the Normandy gentry. His family had for generations been allied with the grand lords who ruled the nation. They had now lost their lands and their homes, but they still wished to signal that they were not like everyone else. Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly tried to give form to a sense of superiority that did not depend on lineage or money: He might no longer have been at the top of society in sheer material terms but he possessed\u2014so he thought\u2014a different and more important title. He was one of the initiators of a new idea of aristocracy: an aristocracy of the spirit rather than the blood. To be an aristocrat in the modern world, he suggested, was a matter of possessing elegant taste, sensibility, lofty ideas, and refined emotions. This, rather than the possession of large tracts of land and a chateau or two, was what gave one the keys to the elite.\n\nIn his own life, Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly expressed his attitude by adopting an extravagant mode of dress and self-presentation. He was very fond of lace cuffs and often wore an elaborate cravat; he grew a vast mustache, adopted a haughty posture, and perfected a way of lifting his chin, lowering his eyelids and gazing down his nose to convey a profound lack of concern for what people in general might think of him, or indeed of anything else. It wasn\u2019t his bloodline that he thought set him apart, it was his soul. He resolutely opposed the notion of popularity. The ideal, he said, was \u201cto be a genius and to be obscure,\u201d although he was in fact rather widely read in his own time. Loftiness and intensity of mind did not need popular endorsement.\n\nBarbey d\u2019Aurevilly was putting a finger on a crucial possibility: that there might be a modern, workable version of a legitimate aristocratic disdain for public opinion. It could be reasonable to see oneself as being \u201cabove\u201d the populist debate, without possessing an estate or an ancient name, just because one had a different sort of mind.\n\nSadly, Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly was too emotionally attached to the vision of looking special to fully articulate the deeper implications of his thought. In reality, a pure aristocrat of the spirit could look entirely normal, live in a perfectly ordinary house and have a common enough job and never sport a cravat. None of the dandyish garb of nineteenth-century aristocrats of the spirit was really necessary. What should in essence set aristocrats of the spirit apart is a commitment to mental refinement.\n\n\u00c9mile L\u00e9vy, Jules Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly, 1881.\n\nTheir disdain for popular opinion isn\u2019t the result of ill will or hostility. It arises from a sober and careful analysis of the human condition. Most people just aren\u2019t interested in understanding an opposed opinion; blind partisanship is simply far more tempting. It may be unfortunate that almost no one has a taste for unpicking the exact logic of an argument, but nothing in history should lead us to expect that they would. It\u2019s surely a pity that millions are more eager to denounce than to explain, but it\u2019s hardly surprising. A love of accurate explanation is almost as rare as the ownership of a castle.\n\nThe pure aristocrat of the spirit ignores public opinion not because they hate people but because they know them well and are sympathetic and compassionate toward the reasons why they won\u2019t be thinking straight. They feel an immense tenderness toward the ordinary preoccupations and struggles of daily life that make intricate argumentation, tenderness, open-mindedness, and the delicate weighing of possibilities unreachable luxuries for most. They are set apart not by haughty contempt but by a melancholic certainty that the disputes of the populace will be chaotic, brutal, partisan, deeply illogical, and unfair because this is the normal, unfortunate lot of the human animal. These aristocrats don\u2019t take any of it to heart. They never hoped to be widely understood or popularly appreciated.\n\nJust as the aristocrat of the blood once did, the new aristocrat of the spirit takes pride in their genealogy. But they are no longer talking about DNA. They belong to the great dynastic family of everyone who has shared their sensitivity, their suffering, and their nobility of mind. They discover that Stendhal was an ancestor and Rembrandt was a member of their clan; Jane Austen perhaps was a relative and possibly Leo Tolstoy. They are, with great legitimacy, laying claim to a different but entirely real kind of nobility: one of ideas, responses, emotions, doubts, worries, pleasures, aspirations, and complications, the common heritage of a small, but very lovely lineage. And so they\u2014we\u2014can look on the disorders of democratic debate in the mass media without anxiety or distress. For we inhabit a very different kind of castle: one made of sensitivity rather than stone, just as enduring and open to all free-thinking newcomers, though invisible to the eyes of most.\n\n4 The Ecstatic Dance\n\nOne of the strangest but also most intriguing and redemptive things that humans get up to, in almost any culture one cares to study, is occasionally to gather in large groups, bathe in the rhythmic sounds of drums and flutes, organs and guitars, chants and cries, and move their arms and legs about in complicated and frenzied ways, losing themselves in the bewilderment of a dance.\n\nDancing has a claim to be considered among the most essential and salutary activities we ever partake in. Not for nothing did Nietzsche, a painfully inhibited figure in day-to-day life, declare, \u201cI would believe only in a God who could dance\u201d\u2014a comment that stands beside his equally apodictic pronouncement: \u201cWithout music, life would be a mistake.\u201d\n\nBut dancing is at the same time an activity that many of us, arguably those of us who might most need to do it, are powerfully inclined to resist and deep down to fear. We stand on the side of the dance floor appalled at the possibility of being called to join in, attempt to make our excuses the moment the music begins, and take pains that no one will ever, ever see our hips unite with a beat.\n\nThe point here is definitely not to learn to dance like an expert but to remember that dancing badly is something we might actually want to do and, equally importantly, something that we already know how to do\u2014at least to the appalling level that is the only proficiency we need to derive key benefits.\n\nIn almost all cultures and at all points of history\u2014except oddly enough perhaps our own\u2014dancing has been widely and publicly understood as a form of bodily exercise with something very important to contribute to our mental state. Dancing has nothing to do with dancing well, being young, or revealing one\u2019s stylishness. Summed up sharply, we might put it like this: Dancing has been valued for allowing us to transcend our individuality and for inducing us to merge into a larger, more welcoming, and more redemptive whole.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that one of the main gods of Hinduism was a dancing god and that Shiva\u2019s dance has a meaning with resonance far beyond a specific religion. By dancing, we may enter, as Shiva does, back into harmony with the cosmos. As limbs swing and bodies sway, the many details of our material and practical lives\u2014our age, levels of prosperity, voting preferences, even our gender\u2014drop away and we reunite with the totality.\n\nShiva as the Lord of Dance, Tamil Nadu, India, c. 950\u20131000.\n\nA comparably rich vision of dancing developed in classical Greece. The Greeks were for the most part committed worshipers of the rational mind. One of their foremost gods, Apollo, was the embodiment of cool reason and disciplined wisdom. However, the Greeks understood\u2014with prescience\u2014that a life devoted only to the serenity of the mind could be at grave risk of desiccation and loneliness. And so they balanced their concern with Apollo with regular festivals in honor of a quite different god, Dionysus, a god that drank wine, stayed up late, loved music\u2014and danced.\n\nThe Greeks knew that the more rational we usually are, the more important it is\u2014at points\u2014to fling ourselves around to the wild rhythms of pipes and drums. At the festivals of Dionysus, held in Athens in March every year, even the most venerable and dignified members of the community would join in with unrestrained dancing that, irrigated by generous amounts of red wine, lasted until dawn.\n\nA word often used to describe such dancing is \u201cecstatic.\u201d It\u2019s a telling term. Ecstatic comes from two Latin words, ex (meaning apart) and stasis (meaning standing), indicating a state in which we are symbolically \u201cstanding apart\u201d from ourselves, separated from the dense, detailed, and self-centered layers of our identities which we normally focus on and obsess over and reconnected with something more primal and more necessary: our common human nature. We remember, through a period of ecstatic dancing, what it is like to belong, to be part of something larger than ourselves, to be indifferent to our own egos\u2014to be reunited with humanity.\n\nWilliam Bouguereau, La Jeunesse de Bacchus, 1884.\n\nThis aspiration hasn\u2019t entirely disappeared in modernity, but it\u2019s been assigned to very particular settings: the disco and the rave. These places often point us in unhelpful directions: toward being cool, a certain age, and knowledgeable about very stylish kinds of clothes and sounds\u2014criteria that leave many of us out. We need urgently to recover a sense of the universal benefit of dancing. The greatest enemy of this is fear, and in particular the fear\u2014as we may put it\u2014that we will look \u201clike an idiot\u201d in front of people whose opinion might matter. The way through this is not to be told that we will in fact be fine and, with a bit of effort, very far from idiotic. Quite the opposite: We should accept with good grace that the whole point of redemptive, consoling, cathartic communal dancing is a chance to look like total, thoroughgoing idiots, the bigger the better, in the company of hundreds of other equally and generously publicly idiotic fellow humans.\n\nWe spend a good deal of our time fearing, as if it were a momentous calamity that we did not even dare contemplate in daylight, that we might be idiots and holding back from a host of important aspirations and ambitions as a result. We should shake ourselves free from such inhibitions by loosening our hold on any remaining sense of dignity and by accepting frankly that we are by nature completely idiotic, great sacks of foolishness that cry in the night, bump into doors, fart in the bath, and kiss people\u2019s noses by mistake\u2013but that far from being shameful and isolating, this idiocy is in fact a basic feature of our nature that unites us immediately with everyone else on the planet. We are idiots now, we were idiots then, and we will be idiots again in the future. There is no other option for a human.\n\nDancing provides us with a primordial occasion on which this basic idiocy can be publicly displayed and communally celebrated. On a dance floor filled with comparable idiots, we can at last delight in our joint foolishness. We can throw off our customary shyness and reserve and fully embrace our dazzling strangeness and derangement. An hour of frantic jigging should decisively shake us from any enduring belief in our normalcy or seriousness. We will no longer be able to bully others, persuade them of our superiority, humiliate them for their mistakes, or pontificate at length on weighty matters. We will no longer worry about how others see us or regret a few things we said to intimidating strangers. The gentle aches in our limbs and our memories of our moves will remind us of anchoring facts that will guarantee our ongoing sanity and kindness.\n\nWhenever we have the chance to invite others around, especially very serious people by whom we\u2019re intimidated or whom we might be seeking to impress, we should remember the divine Dionysus and dare, with his wisdom in mind, to put on \u201cDancing Queen,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m So Excited\u201d or \u201cWe are Family.\u201d Knowing that we have Nietzsche on our side, we should let rip with a playlist that includes \u201cWhat a Feeling,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men.\u201d We should lose command of our normal rational pilot selves, abandon our arms to the harmonies, throw away our belief in a \u201cright\u201d way to dance or indeed to live, build the intensity of our movements to a frenzy, gyrate our heads to empty them of their absurd worries, forget our jobs, qualifications, status, achievements, plans, hopes, and fears\u2014and merge with the universe or at least its more immediate representatives, our fellow new mad friends, before whom the disclosure of idiocy will be total.\n\nAround us might be a formally shy accountant, an efficient dental nurse, or a white-haired school principal bending up and down and flinging their arms in the air, throwing their heads back, contorting their bodies. After a few songs, something astonishing will begin to happen: It won\u2019t matter any more that we said a slightly out of place thing in a meeting two weeks ago, that we haven\u2019t yet met the love of our life, or that we still don\u2019t understand very much at all. We will feel a part of something far more important than ourselves, a supportive community in which our individual errors and doubts will cease to weigh so heavily and punishingly upon us.\n\nThrough dance, we glimpse a huge project: how we might more regularly experience ourselves as vulnerable in front of other people in order to become better friends to ourselves and more generous and compassionate companions to others. The true potential of dancing has for too long been abandoned by thoughtful people to stylish elites who have forgotten the elemental seriousness of allowing themselves to be and look idiotic. We should reclaim the ecstatic dance and uninhibited boogie-woogie for their deepest universal purposes: to reconnect, reassure, and reunite us.\n\n5 Learning to be Angry\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that one of the dominant problems in the world today is an excess of anger. We know all about the very shouty and their antics: their tantrums, their lack of reason, their unwillingness to compromise. Furthermore, it threatens to get a lot worse because we seem to be locked into a set of dynamics\u2014political, technological, environmental\u2014which promise an ever less patient, ever less serene, and ever less forgiving future.\n\nBut it may be rather more realistic, albeit odd-sounding, to insist on the very opposite: that whatever the impression generated by a publicly vocal angry cohort, the far more common yet, by nature, invisible problem is a contrary tendency: a widespread inability to get angry, a failure to know how rightly and effectively to mount a complaint, an inarticulate swallowing of frustration and the bitterness, the subterranean \u201cacting out\u201d and the low-level depression that follow from not allowing any of our rightful sorrows to find expression. For every person who shouts too loudly, there are at least twenty who have unfairly lost their voice.\n\nWe are not talking here of delirious rage, the sort that injures innocents and leads nowhere. The point isn\u2019t to rehabilitate barbarism but to make the case for a capacity to speak up, with dignity and poise, in order to correct a reasoned sense that something isn\u2019t right\u2014and that those around us need to take our opposing perspective on board.\n\nWe are as a rule hopeless at being angry, from the very nicest of motives: in part, from a belief in the complexity of situations and the minds of other people, which undercuts enthusiasm for anything that smacks of self-righteousness or pride. We tell ourselves, in relationships or at work, that others must have good reasons for behaving as they do, that they must be essentially kind and good and that it would be an insult to their efforts to raise our hand about a problem that we surely don\u2019t even entirely understand.\n\nWe tend to import our modesty from childhood. It\u2019s a privilege to allow a child to manifest their frustration and not all parents are game. Some are very keen on having a \u201cgood baby.\u201d They let the infant know from the first that being \u201cnaughty\u201d isn\u2019t funny and that this isn\u2019t a family where children are allowed to \u201crun rings around\u201d the adults. Difficult moods and tantrums, complaints and rages are not to be part of the story. This certainly ensures short-term compliance, but paradoxically, preternaturally good behavior is usually a precursor of bad feelings, and in extremes of mental unwellness, in adulthood. Feeling loved enough that one can flip off parental figures and occasionally fling something\u2014soft\u2014across the room belongs to health; truly mature parents have rules and allow their children sometimes to break them.\n\nOtherwise, there is a species of inner deadness that comes from having had to be too good too soon and to resign one\u2019s point of view without a flicker of self-defense. In relationships, this might mean a tendency to get taken royally for a ride for many years, not in terms of outright abuse\u2014though that too\u2014but of the kind of low-level humiliation which seems the lot of people who can\u2019t make a fuss. At work, an unwavering concern for politeness, empathy, and gentleness may end up providing the perfect preconditions for being walked all over.\n\nWe need to relearn the neglected art of politely, on necessary occasions, being a pain. The danger of those who have never shouted is that they might, in compensation, end up screaming. That isn\u2019t the point either. The goal is a firm but self-possessed protest: Excuse me, but you are ruining what\u2019s left of my life. I\u2019m so sorry, but you are cauterizing my chances of happiness. I beg your pardon, but this is enough . . .\n\nWe think a lot about going on vacation and trying new activities. There\u2019s plenty of enthusiasm for learning other languages and attempting foreign dishes. But true exoticism and adventure may lie closer to home: in the emotional sphere, and in the courage and originality required to give contained anger a go, perhaps tonight, after supper. We have the speeches written in our heads already. There is likely to be a spouse, a parent, a colleague, or a child who hasn\u2019t heard enough from us for far too long\u2014and with whom it would be of incalculable benefit to our heart rate and our emotional and physical constitution to have a word. The timid always imagine that anger might destroy everything good. They overlook, because their childhoods encouraged them to, that anger can also be a fertilizer from which something a lot less bitter and a lot more alive can emerge.\n\n6 Hugo\u2019s Defiance\n\nThere have been few writers as brave as Victor Hugo. Over a turbulent sixty-year career, he fought fiercely for what he believed in: republican government, medieval architecture, an end to capital punishment, school and prison reform, a United States of Europe, and the right to lead the kind of complicated private life that upsets prudes. We shouldn\u2019t allow his posthumous acclaim to disguise how much he was, in certain quarters, loathed in his lifetime.\n\nAnd yet, as his portrait suggests, he knew full well how to face critics down. In 1845, Hugo\u2019s friend the academic and politician Abel Fran\u00e7ois Villemain fell into despair because of rumors about his sexuality and attacks on his work by professional enemies. Only concern for his daughters prevented Villemain from killing himself. Fortunately, Hugo was both a good friend and a great consoler, and came over one evening to shake him from his sorrow:\n\nYou have enemies! Well who doesn\u2019t have them? Guizot has enemies, Thiers has enemies, Lamartine has enemies. Haven\u2019t I myself been fighting for twenty years? Haven\u2019t I spent twenty years being hated, sold down the river, betrayed, reviled, taunted and insulted? Have my books not been ridiculed and my actions travestied? I\u2019ve had traps set for me; I\u2019ve even fallen into a few . . . What do I care? I have contempt. It\u2019s one of the hardest but also most necessary things in life to learn to have contempt. Contempt protects and crushes. It\u2019s like a breast plate and an axe. Do you have enemies? That\u2019s simply the fate of anyone who has done anything worthwhile or launched any new idea. It\u2019s a necessary fog that clings to anything that shines. Fame must have enemies, as light must have gnats. Don\u2019t worry about it; just have contempt. Keep your spirit serene and your life lucid. Never give your enemies the satisfaction of thinking that they\u2019ve been able to cause you grief or pain. Stay happy, cheerful, contemptuous and firm.\n\nPeople-pleasing carries grave risks, as Hugo knew only too well, and it\u2019s well-targeted contempt that can save our spirits.\n\n\u00c9tienne Carjat, Victor Hugo, 1876.\n\n7 Learning to Lay Down Boundaries\n\nOne of the reasons why our lives might be less sane than they should be is that we have missed out on an awkward-sounding but critical art whose absence we may until now never even have noticed: that of laying down boundaries.\n\nLaying down a boundary involves informing those around us\u2014colleagues, parents, children, lovers\u2014of a given set of objectively reasonable things that we are going to require in order to feel respected and happy, while doing so in a way that conveys confidence, self-possession, warmth, and a mixture of kindness and strength.\n\nThose who can successfully lay down boundaries will tell their small child that though they love them very much, once this game is over, Mommy or Daddy is not going to want to play another round and it will be time to go upstairs for hair-washing and there\u2019s simply no other way, darling chipmunk, however disappointing I know this will sound, and biting or kicking is not the answer, as we\u2019ve discussed before. The good boundary-builder will wait until everyone is well rested to tell their partner that though they love them to take the initiative in a hundred areas, when it comes to their own family, they want to be left in charge\u2014and therefore it wasn\u2019t right for the partner to call up their mother-in-law without warning in order to arrange the forthcoming holidays. And at work, the boundaried manager will tell their new hire that though they want to be supportive where possible, it simply isn\u2019t their role to complete schedules or manage budgets for others.\n\nHowever, because most of us have not been educated in this byway of emotional maturity, the boundaries are either non-existent or else established in a random or destructive manner. As the technical language has it, we are either too compliant or too rigid. Mommy or Daddy might not, therefore, ever say they\u2019ve had enough of the game and, even when wilting, play on late into the night, ensuring that chipmunk will be exhausted and cross the next day, as well as craving the security that comes from knowing that their grown-up is \u201cgrown up\u201d enough to say no, even to what they ostensibly badly want\u2014if there\u2019s one thing we crave more than that our wishes are granted, it\u2019s someone responsible enough to resist granting them all. In a relationship, we might never explain what we require in order to feel content and therefore either store up our resentments\u2014and, usually, therefore grow unable to have sex\u2014or else burst into unexplained rages that exhaust our partner\u2019s capacity for love. At work, meanwhile, we might develop a reputation as a friendly pushover or as an unreasonable tyrant whom it becomes a lot of fun to try to evade.\n\nThose who can\u2019t lay down boundaries have invariably not, in their early lives, had their own boundaries respected. Someone didn\u2019t allow them to say when they were unhappy with a genuinely difficult situation; someone didn\u2019t give much of a damn about their hurt feelings or distinctive hopes; someone insinuated that being good meant falling in line, always, immediately. No one modeled the skill of winning, graceful objection. And so now, when the time comes to make a request of others, three powerful anxieties bedevil the boundary-less person:\n\nif I speak up, they will hate me\n\nif I speak up, I will become a target for retribution\n\nif I speak up, I will feel like a horrible person\n\nThough such fears manifest themselves as unquestionable certainties, they are amenable to gentle probing. People almost never hate those who make polite and reasonably framed demands; in fact, they tend to respect and like them a little more. They feel in the presence of a maturity and kindly authoritativeness that appear worthy of their time, as well as seeming rare and a bit thrilling. Frustrating someone\u2019s wishes doesn\u2019t have to be evidence of selfishness; it may signal a noble concern for another\u2019s long-term well-being and flourishing. We can adore someone, wish them the very best, have the kindest intentions toward them\u2014and still, very diplomatically and yet very decisively, tell them no.\n\nAn alternative response to building boundaries is a habit of throwing up walls topped with razor wire ringed by machine-gun turrets, or, to put it more simply, a tendency to get swiftly and gratingly defensive. The manically defensive person is also laboring under a set of highly unfortunate misapprehensions:\n\nthat everyone is trying to hurt them badly\n\nthat no one will listen unless they hit back with immense force\n\nthat their needs cannot ever truly be met\n\nYet the alternative to lacking all boundaries is not violent defensiveness. We should not let boundary-building be undermined by its most zealous practitioners. There is always a means to make a sound case without reaching for a weapon.\n\nIt is notable that the problem of boundary-building is particularly acute not so much around strangers but in intimate life. We may well be able to fight our corner with people we care little about\u2014the person at the car rental desk, the tax official; the problem comes when we are dealing with someone who loves us and whom we have allowed into our emotional inner sanctum. It is as if, in a deep part of our minds, we cannot reconcile the notion that someone might at once be genuinely caring and capable of betraying our best interests. We find it hard to be simultaneously intimate and always a touch vigilant. What should help us to absorb this eventuality is to remember that just as we can say no and still be kind, so another can have harmed us and yet remain, in their essence, good.\n\nIt takes a little self-confidence and courage to be able to notice just how bad we may be at the art of boundary-laying. We may have spent a large chunk of our lives already in an essentially passive relationship to everyday infringements by people close to us. But we aren\u2019t a piece of helpless flotsam on the river of others\u2019 wishes; we have agency, direction, and, as it were, a rudder. The price to pay for affection isn\u2019t compliance. We can gradually take on board a highly implausible-sounding but redemptive notion: that we can prove lovable and worthy of respect and at the same time, when the occasion demands it\u2014as it probably will a few times every day\u2014utter a warm-sounding but definitive \u201cno.\u201d\n\n8 You Could Finally Leave School\n\nTechnically, most of us leave school at eighteen\u2014an event that tends to be vividly etched in the memory and surrounded by considerable ceremony and emotion. And yet rather oddly, despite appearances, many of us in fact don\u2019t manage to leave school at that point at all. In a deep part of our minds, we may still be there, well into adulthood, not sitting in a classroom precisely but, in terms of how our minds work, as much stuck within the confines of a school-based world-view as if we were showing up for assembly every day\u2014generating immense and unnecessary degrees of unhappiness and compromise for ourselves in the process.\n\nWhat beliefs might be some of the hallmarks of an enduring school-like way of thinking:\n\nFirst and foremost, those in authority know what they are doing and our task is to obey and jump through the hoops they set for us. We desire to please teachers and gain prizes, cups, and ribbons.\n\nThere is an implicit curriculum out there\u2014an externally mandated map of what we need to do to succeed\u2014and a wise person must dutifully subscribe to its demands.\n\nWork should, when it\u2019s going well, feel substantially irksome, dull, and somewhat pointless. Schools teach us to forget, or ignore, the clues offered to us by our own boredom. They teach us dangerous degrees of patience, subtly training us in intellectual masochism.\n\nWe\u2019re doing it for someone else\u2014an audience: our teachers and our parents, and their substitutes in adult life. Make us proud. You have to shine. We\u2019ve given you so much. What matters is the performance, not any inner sense of satisfaction.\n\nAuthority figures are benign, wanting what is good for us and speaking on behalf of our long-term interests. We\u2019ll look after you. If you follow our rules, you will thrive. We don\u2019t think we could ever know better and we distrust our instincts.\n\nExams, and all their successors, are fundamentally accurate. Those who set them have worked out the ultimate test of our value and we are what we score.\n\nEvery school is, in addition, a miniature society, equipped with a strong sense of what values to revere and codes to follow. Bullies lurk, ready to mock and identify any departures from the norm. We can\u2019t escape them because they are next to us in class every day. They will spot and persecute the weirdos; they can ruin our lives. We learn to cower and adjust our attitudes. Following the herd is paramount.\n\nNone of these ways of thinking require us to be sitting in a geography class. We might be in an office selling garden furniture to the Belgian market and yet still think like this. We might have children of our own and yet inside still think that there are exams to pass and cups to be won. What would it mean to break the mold? What would it mean finally to leave school?\n\nTo know some of the following:\n\nThere is no one way, no guarantee of a set path to fulfillment, laid out by authority figures. They don\u2019t know because no one knows.\n\nThe safe path may be entirely dangerous to our flourishing.\n\nOur boredom is a vital tool that tells us what is slowly killing us\u2014and reminds us that time is monstrously short.\n\nAuthority is not by definition benign. The teachers and their substitutes have no real plan for us except in so far as it suits their own advancement. It might look as if they want our supreme good but in reality they want us to play their game for their own benefit. At the end, they have no proper prize to offer us.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the bullies think. No one is normal. Dare to make enemies\u2014indeed, we must do so as the price to pay for having developed a character and found something truly to believe in.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be tough on ourselves for lingering so long. School is an immensely impressive system. We start there when we are not much bigger than a chair. For more than a decade, it\u2019s all we know. It is the outside world and it is what those who love us most tell us we should respect. It speaks with great authority not just about itself, but about life in general. It is sold to us as a preparation for the whole of existence. But, of course, the main thing it does is to prepare us for yet more school. It is an education in how to thrive within its own profoundly peculiar rules, with only a tenuous connection to the world beyond.\n\nKnowing all this, we might do a very strange-sounding thing. We might finally work up the courage to leave our inner school, be it at twenty-eight, thirty-five, or sixty-two, and enter the wider, boundless world we have been in flight from for too long.\n\n9 Grand Libraries\n\nThe problem with libraries is that they can be so large, impressive, and filled with knowledge that they unwittingly embed in us an idea that everything worth registering, everything valuable and true, must lie \u201cout there,\u201d must already have been classified on a shelf with an index number to await our discovery the moment we cease to be so preoccupied with ourselves.\n\nBut what this modest, respectful, and quietly self-hating conclusion disguises is that each one of us is an unparalleled and superlative center of knowledge in and of ourselves. Our minds have more ideas stored in them than are to be found in the collective catalogues of the Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and the British Library in London. We have vaults filled with a greater number of moving and beautiful scenes than exist in all the world\u2019s greatest museums put together. We are just failing to wander the stacks and galleries as often as we should; we are failing to notice what we have seen. So convinced are we that insights of worth lie beyond us, we have omitted to consult the treasury of thoughts and visions generated every hour by our endlessly brilliant, fatefully unexplored minds.\n\nThe American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked, \u201cIn every work of genius, we recognize our own rejected thoughts.\u201d In other words, geniuses don\u2019t have thoughts that are in the end so very different from our own; they have simply had the confidence to take them more seriously. Rather than imagining that their minds are only a pale shadow of the minds of infinitely greater thinkers who lived and died elsewhere long ago, they have been respectful enough of their existence to conceive that one or two properly valuable ideas might plausibly choose to alight in the familiar aviary of their own intelligences. Thinking is\u2014in a way we generally refuse to imagine\u2014a truly democratic activity.\n\nWe all have very similar and very able minds. Where geniuses differ is in their more confident inclinations to study them properly.\n\nCandida H\u00f6fer, Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra IV, 2006.\n\n10 Learning to Listen to Your Boredom\n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of small children is their militant aversion to boredom. With ruthless determination, they embark on one occupation after another, shifting their focus whenever an even marginally more attractive prospect comes into view. An average morning might involve taking out eight board games from the cupboard, then, just as it seemed it might be time for Snakes and Ladders, experimenting with turning the couch into a ski slope, then trying to pull toy rabbit\u2019s tail off, followed by exploring what happens to the chocolate chip cookies when you pound them with a hammer, before finally tipping up all the kitchen chairs and pretending they might be ships engaged in a sea battle.\n\nWhat we call education is in large measure an attempt to bring order to this peripatetic chaos by teaching the child to ignore the welter of their own spontaneous enthusiasms and instead learn to sit with their boredom for a while in the name of getting something substantial done: listening to a lengthy speech about kindness by the head teacher without screaming, enduring a forty-five-minute maths lesson without getting up to dance, resisting the temptation to draw an imaginary world during an introductory French class. Becoming that most prized of things, a \u201cgood child,\u201d means mastering the art of suppressing our own boredom in the name of growing up.\n\nThe rationale for this pedagogical move is both solid and noble: there is clearly a great deal to be gained from not running away the moment a new fancy enters the mind. Yet the problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re generally blind to this logic but that we\u2019re far too good at submitting to it. Most of us are fatefully too proficient at bearing our own boredom.\n\nAlong the way, we forget that boredom has many important things to teach us. It is, at its best, a confused, inarticulate but genuine signal from a deep part of our minds that something is very wrong. We may not quite know what, but the sensation of being bored frequently contains\u2014especially for otherwise sensible adults\u2014an apprehension of genuine danger. There are boring books that should in all fairness be tossed aside. There are boring people we should, in order not to wither inside, refuse to see. There are boring movies we should walk out of. And what should sharpen our courage to do so is an ongoing awareness that the fundamental currency of our lives is time, of which we are in desperately short supply, there being on average no more than 26,000 days or so in an entire existence on the planet.\n\nListening to our boredom will tug us back to our true concerns. We realize what our tastes in literature really are, what sort of entertainment we actually go in for, what properly enthuses us about other people. Boredom functions as the scalpel with which we can cut off all that is \u201cdead\u201d and extraneous about our lives. The courage to admit to our boredom allows us, gradually, to develop a personality. Boredom is the inarticulate voice of a fundamental idea: that something has been oversold to us and needs to be discounted.\n\nIt is telling that, as they grow older, many artists instinctively get better at listening to their boredom and produce greatly superior work as a result\u2014what critics commonly refer to as a \u201clate style,\u201d marked by impatience, brevity, courage, and intensity: one thinks of Bach\u2019s exceptional later choral works, the final short stories of Chekhov, or the sublime paper cut-outs of the dying Matisse. Poignantly, on a tour of a primary school an ageing Picasso once said, \u201cAt their age, I knew how to paint like Titian. It\u2019s taken me a lifetime to remember a greater achievement: how to paint like a child.\u201d What he meant was that it had taken him decades to shake off a compliant urge to paint \u201cwell\u201d and \u201crespectably\u201d and to listen instead more closely to his own sense of fun\u2014which is a serious business not to be confused with its lesser sibling, frivolity. Pushed by mortality into a new respect for his own centers of pleasure, Picasso had learned how to overcome every trace of the mannered approach of his youth in order to focus instead on the joy of decorating a canvas with the loose brushstrokes, exuberance, and bold colors well known to those natural artistic masters: five-year-old children.\n\nWhen he was fourteen: Pablo Picasso, Academic Study, 1895.\n\nWhen he was seventy-six\u2014and had finally remembered to listen to his boredom: Pablo Picasso, The Pigeons, 1957.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be a towering figure of twentieth-century art for the point to apply. All of us need to learn to develop a \u201clate style,\u201d ideally as early on in our lives as possible: a way of being wherein we shake off the dead hand of habit and social fear and relearn to listen to what entertains us\u2014and so can stand the best chance of properly pleasing others too. The results should apply not to works of art in a museum, but to aspects of our intimate lives: to the way we choose a career, host a dinner party, go on a vacation, have sex, tell an anecdote, or act around our friends. Here too lie multiple opportunities to cut to the chase, to say what really matters, and to express what we truly feel and want, while we yawn politely but defiantly at all that is slowly killing us.\n\n11 Gessner\u2019s Hedgehog\n\nEarly in his career, the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner formulated an enviably ambitious plan: He would spend the rest of his life tracking down and describing every animal on the planet, from the armadillo to the green chameleon, the Egyptian mongoose to the rhinoceros. His labors resulted in one of the first and most beautiful works of zoology, Historia animalium, published in Zurich between 1551 and 1558.\n\nGessner got a lot of things wrong. He was muddled about names and numbers of legs. Many of his colors were off. He was confused about the numbers of stripes on the tiger and spots on the leopard. But it is Gessner\u2019s boldness that continues to impress. He didn\u2019t worry about the odd mistake, nor did he limit his aspirations for fear of treading on other experts\u2019 toes.\n\nHe did have one enormous advantage, however: he was early on in the game. He did not have to suffer from the dispiriting sense, which too often subsumes us today, that everything must surely already be known; that there is nothing at all we might think that hasn\u2019t already been better expressed somewhere else by someone else. The existence of so many books\u2014130 million and rising\u2014doesn\u2019t so much inspire as crush us: What more could we possibly add? What thought worth having could ever germinate in our naive minds? The virgin snow across which Gessner once drove his intellectual sledge is now criss-crossed with others\u2019 tracks. Increased knowledge has undermined our intellectual self-confidence.\n\nBut this cannot in truth be fair, for we still don\u2019t understand so much: how to have good marriages, run countries, educate children, create beautiful architecture, or overcome loneliness\u2014just to start the list. We have mapped less than one billionth of the real map of knowledge. We are almost as much at the beginning as Gessner was. Nothing should legitimately stop us from imagining that we couldn\u2019t right now head out and, with a fair wind and a few years of toil, discover a menagerie of things at once unknown, colorful, and essential.\n\nConrad Gessner, Hedgehog, from Historia animalium, 1551.\n\n12 How to Lengthen Your Life\n\nThe normal way we set about trying to extend our lives is by striving to add more years to them\u2014usually by eating more couscous and broccoli, going to bed early, and running in the rain. But this approach may turn out to be quixotic, not only because Death can\u2019t reliably be warded off with kale, but at a deeper level because the best way to lengthen a life is not by attempting to stick more years on to its tail.\n\nOne of the most basic facts about time is that, even though we insist on measuring it as if it were an objective unit, it doesn\u2019t, in all conditions, seem to be moving at the same pace. Five minutes can feel like an hour; ten hours can feel like five minutes. A decade may pass like two years; two years may acquire the weight of half a century. And so on.\n\nIn other words, our subjective experience of time bears precious little relation to the way we like to measure it on a clock. Time moves more or less slowly according to the vagaries of the human mind: it may fly or it may drag; it may evaporate into airy nothing or achieve enduring density.\n\nIf the goal is to have a longer life, whatever the dieticians may urge, it would seem that the priority should be not to add raw increments of time but to ensure that whatever years remain feel appropriately substantial. The aim should be to densify time rather than to try to extract one or two more years from the grip of Death.\n\nWhy, then, does time have such different speeds, moving at certain points bewilderingly fast, at others with intricate moderation? The clue is to be found in childhood. The first ten years almost invariably feel longer than any other decade we have on earth. The teens are a little faster but still crawl. Yet by our forties, time will have started to trot; and by our sixties, it will be unfolding at a bewildering gallop.\n\nThe difference in pace is not mysterious but has to do with novelty. The more our days are filled with new, unpredictable, and challenging experiences, the longer they will feel. And, conversely, the more one day is exactly like another, the faster it will pass by in a blur. Childhood ends up feeling so long because it is the cauldron of novelty; because its most ordinary days are packed with extraordinary discoveries and sensations. These can be as apparently minor yet as significant as the first time we explore the zip on a cardigan or hold our nose under water, the first time we look at the sun through the cotton of a beach towel or dig our fingers into the putty holding a window in its frame. Dense as it is with stimuli, the first decade can feel a thousand years long.\n\nBy middle age, things can be counted upon to have grown a lot more familiar. We may have flown around the world a few times. We no longer get excited by the idea of eating a pineapple, owning a car, or flicking a light switch. We know about relationships, earning money, and telling others what to do. And as a result, time runs away from us without mercy.\n\nOne solution often suggested at this point is that we should put all our efforts into discovering fresh sources of novelty. We need to become explorers and adventurers. We must go to Machu Picchu or Angkor Wat, Astana or Montevideo; we need to find a way to swim with dolphins or order a thirteen-course meal at a world-famous restaurant in downtown Lima. That will finally slow down the cruel gallop of time.\n\nBut this is to labor under an unfair, expensive, and ultimately impractical notion of novelty: that it must involve seeing new things, when in fact it should really involve seeing familiar things with new eyes. We may by middle age certainly have seen a great many things in our neighborhoods, but we are\u2014fortunately for us\u2014unlikely to have properly noticed most of them. We have probably taken a few cursory glances at the miracles of existence that lie to hand and assumed, quite unjustly, that we know all there is to know about them. We\u2019ve imagined we understand the city we live in, the people we interact with, and, more or less, the point of it all.\n\nBut of course we have barely scratched the surface. We have grown bored of a world we haven\u2019t begun to study properly. And that, among other things, is why time is racing by.\n\nThe pioneers at making life feel longer in the way that counts are not dieticians but artists. At its best, art is a tool that reminds us of how little we have fathomed and noticed. It reintroduces us to ordinary things and reopens our eyes to a latent beauty and interest in precisely those areas we had ceased to bother with. It helps us to recover some of the manic sensitivity we had as newborns. Think of C\u00e9zanne looking closely at apples, as if he had never seen one before, and nudging us to do likewise.\n\nPaul C\u00e9zanne, Apples, 1878\u20139.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to make art in order to learn the most valuable lesson of artists, which is about noticing properly, living with our eyes open and thereby, along the way, savoring time. Without any intention to create something that could be put in a gallery, we could\u2014as part of a goal of living more deliberately\u2013take a walk in an unfamiliar part of town, ask an old friend about a side of their life we\u2019d never dared probe, lie on our back in the garden and look up at the stars or hold our partner in a way we never tried before. It takes a rabid lack of imagination to think we have to go to Machu Picchu to find something new to perceive.\n\nIn Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s novel The Idiot, a prisoner has suddenly been condemned to death and been told he has only a few minutes left to live. \u201cWhat if I were not to die!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cWhat if life were given back to me\u2013what infinity! . . . I\u2019d turn each minute into a whole age . . .\u201d Faced with losing his life, the poor wretch recognizes that every minute could be turned into aeons of time, with sufficient imagination and appreciation.\n\nIt is sensible enough to try to live longer lives. But we are working with a false notion of what long really means. We might live to be a thousand years old and still complain that it had all rushed by too fast. We should be aiming to lead lives that feel long because we manage to imbue them with the right sort of open-hearted appreciation and unsnobbish receptivity, the kind that five-year-olds know naturally how to bring to bear. We need to pause and look at one another\u2019s faces, study the sky, wonder at the eddies and colors of the river, and dare to ask the kinds of questions that open others\u2019 souls. We don\u2019t need to add years; we need to densify the time we have left by ensuring that every day is lived consciously\u2014and we can do this via a maneuver as simple as it is momentous: by starting to notice all that we have as yet only seen.",

      "content": "## V : Hope\n\nFor most of our lives, the majority of us don\u2019t require anything as specific and formal-sounding as \u201creasons\u201d to keep living. We take hope for granted, rising out of bed with purpose and direction; we may be preoccupied by this or that challenge, but the business of existence as a whole is never in question.\n\nThen there are other moods, more somber and confused in nature, in which what we are doing on the earth comes to seem like a far more doubtful and painful matter. An accumulation of reversals\u2014some perhaps minor, others more severe\u2014undermines our will to endure much longer; the automatic reflex of living escapes us. There seems no point in getting up, we have no will to eat, we fall into a reverie halfway through pouring a glass of water, there is nowhere we can think of traveling, there is no one we want to talk to. We are going through the motions, but our spirit is elsewhere.\n\nIn our sad state, we can\u2019t any longer say why we should take the trouble to get dressed or shower, why we should go to work or utter a word\u2014or in fact take another breath. None of it seems obvious in the slightest. We might look around us in the park\u2014at parents with children, pensioners with their dogs, or planes crossing the skies\u2014and wonder by what peculiar, deluded and mysterious forces the whole vainglorious show is kept in motion.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as if, when we are feeling purposeful and optimistic, we necessarily have a conscious grasp of the reasons why we have a taste for life. We have our reasons but we don\u2019t have any need to identify them. They are so much in our command and are so many in number, we don\u2019t single them out. We think it\u2019s life itself we love, so don\u2019t pay homage to any singular set of ingredients: for example, our health or our friends, our good name or our prospects of promotion. But when despair strikes, we can\u2019t any longer be so casual about what might have the capacity to buoy us up.\n\nWe must learn to think through in rigorous ways what we had been accustomed to locate by reflex. We have to go in careful search of reasons why we should be. We have to ask ourselves, in a way the blessed never have to, how we are going to get through the coming years\u2014or why we should bother, given the pain involved.\n\nWhat follows is a set of small essays to assist us in our search for hope. They seek to lay before us some representative reasons why, despite everything, we might continue with tomorrow. Some are deliberately dark: It isn\u2019t always optimism that best cheers. Our spirits can be sunk by a punishing impression that everyone else is content and that we are alone in our misery\u2014and accordingly, there can be relief in learning that sadness is in fact very widespread and that there are solid grounds for why life is often hellish.\n\nBut we also need thoughts that can restore perspective and situate our woes in a larger context of time and space. Finally, we can shift to some positive pleasures that, like the caress of morning light on the blind in the convalescent\u2019s room, await the recovering soul.\n\nIf we are to make a sustained recovery, we need to work our way toward our own well-defined list of arguments for pushing back against the forces of depression. The making of a list of hopeful things begins here.\n\n1 The End of the Macrauchenia\n\nGiven the scale of the perils that face humanity, it is hardly surprising if serenity and peace of mind are hard to come by. Reasons to panic are daily brought before our eyes by the ever-inquisitive and always alarming modern media: There are wildfires raging across South America and Australia, currency manipulation is rife, people smugglers are working with impunity in Eastern Europe, bureaucracy is stifling innovation across the prosperous world, the air in large cities is more polluted than ever, soon there will be no more snow leopards, orangutans, or leatherback sea turtles, and there\u2019s a gigantic new kind of pink seaweed threatening the health of the southern oceans. It\u2019s a wonder we ever sleep.\n\nAt moments of particular alarm, we might turn our thoughts to the Macrauchenia. For millions of years, these delightful camel-sized animals flourished across what we now call South America, being found in their largest numbers in the north of Argentina. They were placid herbivores, with an endearingly droopy nose, a soft fleecy coat, and warm, contemplative eyes. They lived in small family groups, browsing inoffensively on the leaves of the jacaranda tree and in the evening trooping down to the many shallow lakes of the region to bathe.\n\nThough the Macrauchenia had a very good run, they sadly didn\u2019t make it in the end. They flourished from the Late Miocene period, about 7 million years ago, but then their fortunes ran out. The species was decimated by newer, aggressive creatures that came down from North America during the Great American Interchange, after the establishment of the Central American land bridge. The last Macrauchenia are estimated to have died\u2014probably in the jaws of some kind of prairie dog\u2014about 10,000 years before the arrival of stooped early humans at the end of the Pleistocene period. It was Charles Darwin who, on a short stopover in Puerto San Juli\u00e1n in Patagonia in 1834, uncovered the first Macrauchenia skeleton and it was given this name by Richard Owen in 1838.\n\nThe Macrauchenia would have been charming to get to know and deeply helpful to the farmers of South America\u2014as well as its tourist industry. But their loss was not unusual. Some 99.9 percent of all organisms that have ever existed have been wiped out across the five mass extinctions of history. Five times over the last 500 million years life has more or less had to begin again from scratch. It is hugely unlikely that any of the species we are currently so attached to, and worried about\u2014the Bornean elephant, the Ganges dolphin\u2014will make it in the long term.\n\nMacrauchenia. This extinct prehistoric mammal lived 7 million to 20,000 years ago (the Late Miocene to the Late Pleistocene).\n\nOur own fate necessarily hangs in the balance as well. It would take a resolute optimist to venture that we will not in time follow the example of most of our forebears, including the narrow-nosed rhinoceros, the flat-headed peccary, and the dwarf hippo. This might seem like an entirely tragic thought, but it has its relieving aspect as well. We are commonly overburdened by a momentous sense of responsibility for what is to come. We worry about peace conferences, the path of gas pipelines, the vagaries of unemployment insurance, and the levels of nitrogen in the soil. These are fine ways to mop up anxiety but, in the grander scheme, we might as well be weeping over the long-distant demise of a friendly South American odd-toed ungulate.\n\nThe news constantly provides us with a ringside seat at the most compelling and horrendous issues of our times, which feed both our outrage and our sense that there must be something we can do to try to prevent disaster. But in the process, we forget the radical limits on our powers to intervene effectively in pretty much any of the dilemmas that bedevil our species. It is our particular historical fate to know more than we have ever done about the troubles of our fellow humans and yet to remain almost wholly ineffective at finding solutions, not because we are uncreative or lethargic but because we have been granted, at best, a teaspoon with which to drain an ocean. Our planet is shaped by gigantic forces\u2014financial, political, biological, extraterrestrial\u2014against which our individual wills are doomed to be substantially powerless. We have about as much chance of altering the dynamics behind our catastrophes as we have of shifting the orbital patterns of the moons of Jupiter.\n\nThere may be a few steps we can take to dampen our crises, but they will tend to be close to home and to concern the welfare of only a handful of people. We should not be harsh or unjust toward ourselves. We didn\u2019t personally make the world and we aren\u2019t individually responsible for its fate.\n\nAs we contemplate the extinct Macrauchenia, we are seeing an image of our own small innocence and admitting a liberating truth: A great many things, fortunately, are not really for us to try to control or feel in charge of. A few of the more nervous, fretful Macrauchenia might once have worried about the survival of their race as evening fell and giant anteaters rustled in the bushes, but the truly wise and contented ones would have loved their families, planned the evening meal for the little ones, and refrained from fretting too much about what was to come over the next million years.\n\n2 After the Catastrophe\n\nIt\u2019s been a lovely day with Grandfather. Aunts Tricia and Julie came by with their children, Christopher and Jennie.\n\nIt\u2019s all pleasantly normal and average, except that the grandfather is Richard Nixon and he used to have the nuclear codes in his office and he engineered the end of the Vietnam War\u2014and in 1974 he would have been put on trial for obstruction of justice and abuse of power and sent to prison, if he hadn\u2019t received a pardon from his successor as president of the United States, Gerald Ford.\n\nWe\u2019ll never face the level of condemnation that he did; no disgrace of ours can ever match his. And yet, after years of soul searching\u2014and with the sheer passage of time\u2014Richard Nixon was able to pull together a worthwhile existence. It was eventually possible to take pleasure in digging the garden, in spending the afternoon with the family, and in catching up with old acquaintances.\n\nFor many people, of course, Nixon was simply an appalling man utterly undeserving of sympathy. But we might be tempted to think of him in a different light when we\u2014in our own way\u2014have badly messed up and earned the contempt of others. Nixon is then, for us, not just a famously bad person but a version of our own flawed selves. Nixon\u2019s failings were played out on the largest scale; our own disasters are more modest and local, but we too have\u2014very often\u2014been the shamefully guilty party.\n\nWhat Nixon is sending us, via an ordinary family snap, is a message about the possibilities of recovery. He wasn\u2019t an adept apologist, he didn\u2019t make a grand return, he never shook off the widespread conviction that he was a devious character. But he was able to adjust and still find genuine sources of goodness and contentment in existence. What makes his example all the more touching is that he did this without being in any way specially skilled at redemption. He was still a flawed, awkward man. He wasn\u2019t coming to the task of recovery with better chances than we have. At a dark moment, the image is speaking to us of our own future: modest, ordinary, but genuinely OK\u2014which at troubled times seems almost more than we can dare to hope for.\n\nPresident Nixon and his daughters, Tricia and Julie, with their children Christopher Nixon Cox and Jennie Eisenhower, 1979.\n\n3 The Bones of the Chief\n\nIn life, he was a great chieftain. After the withdrawal of the Roman army from Britain, he and his clan carved out a kingdom for themselves in the area that today lies just west of London. He led his people on daring raids on villages across the river. They sang his praises as they caroused around the campfire at night. He was a tall man for the time, evidently a ferocious fighter. He was famous and feared in the surrounding lands.\n\nWhen he died, they buried him with all possible honor on a small hill overlooking a bend in the River Thames: the strategic center of their territory. Even in death, he would be the one to guide and protect them. They laid him out in his grave with his great sword and his treasured glass beaker\u2014a prestigious rarity\u2014beside him. The women wailed for days; the men lit funeral bonfires.\n\nAnd then time passed. His kingdom was conquered and his Anglo-Saxon people became serfs to the new invading masters, the Normans. Quiet tenant farmers grazed their sheep on the lands he had won in battle. A railway line was constructed nearby, suburban villas sprang up, and, on tranquil evenings, retired solicitors and affable bank clerks and their wives would walk their dogs on the springy turf above his grave. The Winter Hill golf club laid out its fairways and sand bunkers where he had once mustered his loyal troops. A branch of a major supermarket chain opened within sight of his resting place and, on windy days, families would come over to fly kites, not realizing that they were standing just a few feet above the fragments of his skull.\n\nAll carried on as normal until, in 2018, a couple of local amateur archaeologists, armed with a metal detector, decided to explore the field. Alerted by the beeping of their machine, they began to very carefully remove the topsoil. His fine sword was half eaten away by rust and its beautiful leather scabbard had all but disintegrated; worms and beetles had consumed his flesh. Most of his bones had disintegrated and the roots of a gorse bush had grown through his ribcage.\n\nArchaeologists excavating at the site of the \u201cMarlow Warlord,\u201d Berkshire.\n\nThere\u2019s a shocking, poignant contrast between what he once was and what became of him. His status, his possessions, and his strength were entirely forgotten. The pagan gods he worshiped were replaced first by Christianity and then by an indifferent atheism. But, of course, this is not a fate peculiar to him. With time it will happen to every one of us. All the great people of today will eventually be forgotten. Their graves will be lost, the entire culture which gave them their prominence and rich rewards will disappear, and archaeologists will one day strive to decipher the identities of people we now find it unimaginable not to know.\n\nIt\u2019s an oddly comforting thought. The distinctions and achievements which seem to matter so much in life will eventually lose their meaning and an ultimate equality of neglect will unite everyone. It won\u2019t matter who was the chief and who the pauper. Even better, we don\u2019t have to wait centuries for this sense of equality to take hold: We can summon the inevitable future into our imaginations right now. The youthful billionaire, the celebrity athlete, the handsome entrepreneur, the glamorous socialite\u2014all will be returned to unity with us. As we look at their faces in a magazine or watch them on our screens, it is as if we can already see the future in which they will, like us, be crumpled anonymous bones in a forgotten patch of our gloriously indifferent earth.\n\n\u201cAnglo-Saxon military chief, trumpeter and warriors, Anno 975,\u201d from Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick and Charles Hamilton Smith, The Costume of the Original Inhabitants of the British Islands . . ., 1815.\n\n4 Mick Jagger and the Jesuit Priest\n\nOne of the great moments of television history occurred in July 1967. Mick Jagger\u2014then at the height of his fame and cultural influence\u2014was helicoptered into the gardens of a large country house in the southeast of England to discuss his views on modern life with a group of distinguished establishment figures. The producers had picked these for one provocative reason above any others: they knew nothing about Jagger or his music.\n\nOne of the desperately out-of-touch interlocutors was a Jesuit priest and former master of an Oxford College, Fr Thomas Corbishley, SJ\u2014seen in the center of the picture in his round clerical collar. He immediately admitted that not only did he know nothing about the Rolling Stones, he\u2019d never heard a single song by any modern band. But he was extremely interested in Mick Jagger nevertheless and, in a patient and kindly way, probed the star to reveal more about his positive beliefs rather than saying what he was against.\n\nTo the many millions of people who watched the show, Corbishley must have seemed comically out of touch, a ridiculous antiquarian relic cut off from the atmosphere of freedom, authenticity, and liberation of modernity. But in his own way, the priest was the truly heroic and independent figure with much to teach his own times and our own. He had opted\u2014against massive societal pressure\u2014not to follow the herd and to pursue issues that were dear to him instead. Whatever the widespread enthusiasm for \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d and \u201cHonky Tonk Women,\u201d Corbishley\u2019s interests lay elsewhere: he had translated the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius Loyola, written commentaries on St Augustine, published a biography of the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and, in a number of books, explored what it meant to be a Catholic in the wake of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nMick Jagger, during the filming of World in Action, July 31, 1967.\n\nThe priest was pursuing what one might term a strategy of voluntary exile from the current preoccupations of his society. He didn\u2019t feel any need to keep up with the flotsam and jetsam of contemporary culture. He felt closer to what was happening in Paris in 1254, when Thomas Aquinas wrote De Ente et Essentia (On Being and Essence) in defense of the Dominican community, than what was unfolding in Mary Quant\u2019s store on the King\u2019s Road in London in October 1965, where the first batch of miniskirts had just been launched. Corbishley was content to be thought ridiculous because he had his own well-defined concept of seriousness to hand.\n\nWe may not quite realize the extent to which we have mortgaged our inner lives to received ideas that are grievously alien to our true selves. We start to be free when we can dare to become\u2014in selected areas wilfully ignorant, when we no longer have to know the names of certain musicians that everyone esteems, when we don\u2019t feel compelled to read particular books that have won prizes, when we are left cold by vacation destinations, clothes, foods, exercise regimes, political scandals, and ideas that are dominant, when we can stay home rather than attend parties with people we dislike\u2014and when we can hear of a celebrity and genuinely wonder who they might be. It is hard enough to have to exist in any given era; we don\u2019t in addition have to mold our souls in its image.\n\n5 The Aztecs and Tezcatlipoca\n\nAt the height of the Aztec Empire in the late 1400s, a major, daily preoccupation for a great many people involved worshiping and placating the god Tezcatlipoca. He was a one-legged divinity of smoke, darkness, hurricanes, and destruction\u2014and a great many darkly beautiful representations of his head were made by affixing precious stones to the skulls of people who had been sacrificed in his honor.\n\nIt was believed that when an earlier version of human society had failed to worship him appropriately, the god had flown into a rage and unleashed a titanic storm that had annihilated everyone on earth. To avoid such a catastrophe ever recurring, every year a young man\u2014selected for his supposed likeness to Tezcatlipoca\u2014would be sacrificed to the god and his remains eaten by priests and royalty. The testy deity would then be induced to send benign rains to end the dry season and implored to resist his more apocalyptic instincts.\n\nThese were deeply and sincerely held beliefs, propounded by the most learned people of the day. To doubt or disregard them would have been reckless. Of course, dangerous questions must, in secret, sometimes have crossed people\u2019s minds: How do we know Tezcatlipoca really exists? How do we know that he wants us to do these things? But to utter such heresies aloud would have been to invite imprisonment and death.\n\nToday Tezcatlipoca has no power to frighten anyone: he\u2019s a carefully labeled exhibit in a museum and a point of reference in obscure academic treatises on the history of weather deities. Our own attempts to predict rainfall involve sober investigations of surface ocean temperatures and the intensity of the currents of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nThe beliefs about Tezcatlipoca have no possible basis in reality, but the Aztecs were not unusually credulous in holding them. On the contrary they were, measured against the broad span of history, entirely normal for doing so. All societies have collectively clung to highly peculiar ideas that in time have been revealed to be deeply mistaken and\u2014often\u2014close to insane. It would be impossible if the same were not true of our own times. The focus of mass delusion may change, but the phenomenon of delusion never abates. Central elements in what is now popularly taken to be the truth are almost certain to be mistaken\u2014because crowds, almost by definition, are not out to discover the actual dimensions of reality. They don\u2019t get agitated by subtle lapses in reasoning; they don\u2019t urgently demand higher standards of evidence; they don\u2019t march through the streets insisting on more thorough research. They merely want to find a sense of reassuring togetherness while demonizing and shaming those who disagree with them.\n\nTurquoise mosaic skull representing the god Tezcatlipoca, c. 1400\u20131521.\n\nFar from clearing the air, modern democracy plays straight into this tendency in our nature, equating the majority view with justice and righteousness. Markets, too, emphasize the primacy of popular sentiment by rewarding companies that have no inclination to disabuse their customers of their errors of taste. It\u2019s our strange fate to be born into an age of crowds in which the best, most precise thoughts are unlikely ever to meet with popular recognition.\n\nSuch an aristocratic attitude can sound absurdly outdated, but it offers us something that remains vital\u2014and has nothing to do with genealogy or connections to the landed gentry. It\u2019s the idea of being convinced from the outset that a popular outlook will frequently be riddled with errors and at odds with the beliefs of a thoughtful few, and that sanity must involve a willingness not to be ashamed, embarrassed, or even much saddened at being repeatedly out of sync with the dominant culture.\n\nBy understanding, without rancor, why most people subscribe to the myths of any age, we are released from waging a hopeless and dispiriting struggle against public opinion. We don\u2019t expect our reasoned mentality to spread or to be easily absorbed. We know that most people will\u2014as a matter of course\u2014worship whatever version of Tezcatlipoca happens to be in vogue. We don\u2019t have to blame them; we can just\u2014quietly\u2014keep to ourselves and hope never to end up on the wrong side of a sacrificial frenzy.\n\n6 I Will Survive\n\nIn October 1978, one of the greatest pop songs of the twentieth century was heard for the first time: Gloria Gaynor\u2019s eternal assertion of defiance: \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d It was initially released as a B-side but it quickly became one of the bestselling singles of all time thanks to its power to touch something universal in the human soul.\n\nGloria Gaynor hadn\u2019t written the song herself. The words had in fact been penned by Dino Fekaris, a rather successful but temporarily disgruntled professional songwriter who\u2019d just been sacked by Motown Records.\n\nThe song is in part a recollection of being trampled upon, of being taken for granted, but it\u2019s not really about the wrong others have done to us; it\u2019s an honest appraisal of the way we have let them do these things to us, because we have been insufficiently on our own side.\n\nThe other has undoubtedly harmed us, but the deeper problem is that we have not known how to esteem ourselves highly enough to stop them doing so. If they thought that we would crumble and lie down and die they did so for a good reason: because that is what we did so many times before. The beauty of the song is that it doesn\u2019t deny that we have been accomplices to the bad treatment that we have traditionally been accorded. We identify with its heroine because she is frank enough to admit that she has been the architect of her own humiliation.\n\nGloria identifies with the overcompliant, fearful part of ourselves. But it\u2019s because she understands our submissive tendencies so well that her deep encouragement to say a resolute \u201cfuck off\u201d to the world is so rousing. This is not the voice of someone who has never been put upon, it is that of a weak and timid being who is no longer going to let her fears rule her life.\n\nGloria Gaynor, 1979.\n\nDefiance doesn\u2019t mean asserting that I know I will survive. At the moment when we belt out the song on the dance floor or\u2014more likely\u2014in the kitchen, we don\u2019t really know what will happen to us: our fears are still raw. We may have been bullied throughout our childhood or our relationships, we may only recently have instructed a lawyer to initiate divorce proceedings or written an email to a colleague. When we join in joyfully with the chorus, we\u2019re making a great and precious leap of faith. We\u2019re finally insisting that our ability to cope is greater than our past has traditionally led us to imagine.\n\nGloria is backing us up to attain what we might term emotional escape velocity. She\u2019s instilling\u2014with the encouragement of deceptively simple yet mesmerizing chords\u2014the state of mind in which we can bear to take on those who have injured us.\n\nAn attitude of defiance is never the whole of what we need. For things to go well, we also have to call on reserves of conciliation, compromise, acceptance, and tolerance\u2014the mature virtues by which genuinely good things are kept afloat in an imperfect world. But that\u2019s not where we are right now. At this point, we still need to gird ourselves for a fight. And this is when the voice of Gloria Gaynor is not just a magnificent instance in the grand history of pop but for us\u2014in a way that might feel embarrassing to admit to anyone else\u2014what our soul needs to hear to save us from the weak but agonizingly familiar side of our nature that has so often given up so soon, too soon, on our hopes of freedom.\n\n7 Budai\n\nBuddhism gives every sign of being an unremittingly pessimistic philosophy: It loses few opportunities to remind us that life is suffering, that disappointment is the rule, and that we are fated to witness all our hopes and aspirations destroyed with time.\n\nIt can therefore feel a little paradoxical to come across the cult of Budai, a Chinese monk who became a saintly figure within Buddhism in the tenth century and is frequently represented in statues and on wall hangings, celebrated for his laughter, quick wit, and large belly, which he loved to rub while throwing back his head and chuckling warmly. What is a portly comedian doing in this religion of lamentation and sorrow? Why should we want to laugh, given what Buddhism has to tell us about our earthly prospects?\n\nThe paradox is only superficial. In essence, Buddhism wants to shake us from our pretensions, our complacency, and our misplaced perfectionism\u2014and if these are its goals, then it sees no logical reason why they might not be accomplished as much via a set of witticisms as via a funereal lament.\n\nBuddhism cannily understood that most humor arises from the omnipresent gap between our hopes and the available reality. We laugh not because things are happy but precisely because we have been helped to recognize that they are so damnably and incorrigibly sad. Our laughter represents a release of tension at the awfulness of everything.\n\nWe might laugh darkly at a joke that tells us that going on vacation will offer us a chance to be unhappy somewhere else with better weather. Or that celebrates marriage as an institution that generously offers us one very specific person to blame for all of our hitherto free-floating misery. Or that describes adolescence as a phase kindly designed by nature to ensure that we won\u2019t end up overly sad that our children are soon going to be leaving home. Laughter is an involuntary spasm provoked by a pithy and skilful assessment of the fundamental misery of existence.\n\nImportantly, we tend to laugh in company. Humor is a social activity. Dark truths that we had contemplated alone, with embarrassment and a sense of having been persecuted by fate, are given a chance to be shared among friends. That we are all laughing together is proof that we are not\u2014whatever our suspicions\u2014actually alone. We are fellow suffering humans facing up to similar sources of frustration and grief. We have not been accorded an especially unpleasant destiny. It turns out that everyone is crying\u2014and therefore laughing\u2014about careers, marriages, ageing, money, and children.\n\nThe secular West has traditionally relegated comedy to the realm of \u201centertainment\u201d; it is \u201cjust\u201d for laughs. Buddhism has been more ambitious. It understood that trying to elicit laughter can be the most effective means of prompting people to confront their pain and isolation. It isn\u2019t a diversion from so-called serious things but rather the most graceful and kindly way of helping us to acknowledge and make our peace with them.\n\nLiu Zhen, stoneware figure of Budai Hesheng, 1486.\n\n8 Cultivate Your Own Garden\n\nIt is crucial to note the subtitle of Candide, eighteenth-century Europe\u2019s most famous novel, which was written in three inspired days in 1759: or Optimism. If there was one central target that its author wanted satirically to destroy, it was the hope of his age, a hope that focused on science, love, technical progress, and reason. Voltaire was enraged. Of course science wasn\u2019t going to improve the world; it would merely give new power to tyrants. Of course philosophy would not be able to explain away the problem of evil; it would only show up our vanity. Of course love was an illusion, power a chimera, humans irredeemably wicked, and the future absurd. Of all this his readers were to be left in no doubt. Hope was a disease and it was Voltaire\u2019s generous goal to try to cure us of it.\n\nNevertheless, his novel is not simply a tragic tale; nor is his own philosophy mordantly nihilistic. The book ends on a memorably tender and stoic note. The tone is elegiac and we encounter one of the finest expressions of the melancholic viewpoint ever written. Candide and his companions have traveled the world and suffered immensely: they have known persecution, shipwrecks, rapes, earthquakes, smallpox, starvation, and torture. But they have, more or less, survived and, in the final pages, find themselves in Turkey\u2014a country Voltaire especially admired\u2014living on a small farm in a suburb of Istanbul. One day they learn of trouble at the Ottoman court: Two viziers and the mufti have been strangled and several of their associates impaled. The news causes upset and fear in many. But near their farm, Candide, together with his friends Martin and Pangloss, pass an old man who is peacefully and indifferently sitting under an orange bower next to his house:\n\nPangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what the name of the strangled Mufti was. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered the worthy man, \u2018and I have never known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.\u2019 Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee . . . \u2013 after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers\u2019 beards. \u2018You must have a vast and magnificent estate,\u2019 said Candide to the Turk. \u2018I have only twenty acres,\u2019 replied the old man; \u2018I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.\u2019 Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. \u2018This honest Turk,\u2019 he said to Pangloss and Martin, \u2018seems to be in a far better place than kings . . . I also know,\u2019 said Candide, \u2018that we must cultivate our garden.\u2019\n\nVoltaire, who liked to stir the prejudices of his largely Christian readers, especially enjoyed giving the idea for the most important line in his book\u2014and arguably the most important adage in modern thought\u2014to a Muslim, the true philosopher of the book known only as \u201cthe Turk\u201d: \u201cIl faut cultiver notre jardin\u201d (\u201cWe must cultivate our garden\u201d) or, as it has variously been translated, \u201cWe must grow our vegetables,\u201d \u201cWe must tend to our lands\u201d or \u201cWe need to work our fields.\u201d\n\nWhat did Voltaire mean with his gardening advice? That we must keep a good distance between ourselves and the world, because taking too close an interest in politics or public opinion is a fast route to aggravation and danger. We should know well enough at this point that humans are troublesome and will never achieve\u2014at a state level\u2014anything like the degree of logic and goodness we would wish for. We should never tie our personal moods to the condition of a whole nation or people in general, or we would have to weep continuously. We need to live in our own small plots, not the heads of strangers. At the same time, because our minds are prey to anxiety and despair, we need to keep ourselves busy. We need a project. It shouldn\u2019t be too large or dependent on many. The project should send us to sleep every night weary but satisfied. It could be bringing up a child, writing a book, looking after a house, running a small store, or managing a little business. Or, of course, tending to a few acres. Note Voltaire\u2019s geographical modesty. We should give up on trying to cultivate the whole of humanity; we should ignore things at a national or international scale. Take just a few acres and make those your focus. Establish a small orchard and grow lemons and apricots. Dig some beds and grow asparagus and carrots. Stop worrying yourself with humanity if you ever want peace of mind again. Who cares what\u2019s happening in Constantinople or what\u2019s up with the grand mufti? Live quietly like the old Turk, enjoying the sunshine in the orange bower next to your house. This is Voltaire\u2019s stirring, ever-relevant form of horticultural quietism. We have been warned and guided.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Voltaire put his lines about the cultivation of the garden into the mouth of a Muslim. He had done a lot of reading about Islam for his Essay on Universal History, published three years before, and properly understood the role of gardens in its theology. For Muslims, because the world at large can never be rendered perfect, it is the task of the pious to try to give a foretaste of what is to come in the afterlife, which can be seen as a well-tended garden\u2014and where that is not possible, in the depiction of a garden in a rug. There should be four canals that allude to the four rivers of paradise, in which were said to flow water, milk, wine, and honey, and where they intersect represents the umbilicus mundi, the navel of the world, where the gift of life emerged. Gardening is no trivial pastime. It\u2019s a central way of shielding ourselves from the influence of the chaotic, dangerous world beyond while focusing our energies on something that can reflect the goodness and grace we long for.\n\nEmperor Babur overseeing his gardeners, c. 1590.\n\nWe melancholics know that humans\u2014ourselves foremost among them\u2014are beyond redemption. We melancholics have given up on dreams of complete purity and unblemished happiness. We know that this world is, for the most part, hellish and heartbreakingly vicious. We know that our minds are full of demons that will not leave us alone for long. Nevertheless, we are committed to not slipping into despondency. We remain deeply interested in kindness, in friendship, in art, in family life\u2014and in spending some very quiet local afternoons gardening.\n\nThe melancholic position is ultimately the only sensible one for a broken human. It\u2019s where we get to, after we have been hopeful, after we have tried love, after we have been tempted by fame, after we have despaired, after we have gone mad, after we have considered ending it\u2014and after we have decided conclusively to keep going. It captures the best possible attitude to pain and the wisest orientation of a weary mind toward what remains hopeful and good.\n\nThe \u201cWagner\u201d Garden Carpet, early 17th century.\n\n9 The Hotaru\n\nOne of nature\u2019s odder creatures is the firefly, a soft-bodied beetle that emits a warm yellow glow from its lower abdomen, typically at twilight, in order to attract mates or prey. Though relatively rare in Europe and North America, the firefly is a common sight in Japan, where it is known as the hotaru. Hotaru are at their most plentiful in June and July and can be seen buzzing in large groups around rivers and lakes. The glittering light is so enchanting, the Japanese have traditionally held firefly festivals\u2014or hotaru matsuri\u2014in order to watch these creatures caper and to recite poetry in their honor.\n\nSomething more magical has happened to the firefly in Japanese culture: it has become philosophical. Zen Buddhist poets and philosophers\u2014the two terms are largely interchangeable\u2014have urged us to look at fireflies as sources of a distinctive wisdom and serenity. What we are truly being invited to see in the firefly is not an insect but a version of ourselves. We too are tiny against the darkness, we too have no option but to put on a desperate light show in the hope of enticing possible partners, and we too won\u2019t last very long: Fireflies all die within three weeks.\n\nImportantly, the metaphor is a generous one. We aren\u2019t being likened to rats or flies, with whom we have a few less flattering similarities as well. Fireflies are graceful and mesmerizing. They appear bold and touching, protesting bravely against the blackness in the limited hours afforded to them.\n\nKobayashi Kiyochika, Fireflies at Ochanomizu, c. 1880.\n\nMany of our mental troubles spring from an overambitious sense of who we are. We ascribe to ourselves an importance that the natural world and our fellow humans turn out not to recognize. We protest in a bad temper at our puniness and lack of agency.\n\nThe metaphor of the firefly bids us to loosen our hold on arrogance and irritation. We should not complain at our slightness but submit to it with wonder and poise. It isn\u2019t a personal curse that we aren\u2019t going to live very long and that our actions are but a short merry dance. We should know and accept our nature: A firefly does not mistake itself for a lion or a tortoise. We can imagine our cities from outer space looking much like the frantic swirls of fireflies across a lake: touching, absurd, beautiful, and minuscule within the order of the cosmos.\n\nThe art of locating important philosophical themes in the natural world is one that Zen makes repeatedly: for example, in relation to bamboo, which is evocative of resilience; water, which is a symbol of patient strength, capable of wearing down stone; and cherry blossom, which is an emblem of the brevity of happiness. Zen seeks to hang its ideology on to everyday things because it wants to make use of what is most ordinarily in our sight to keep us tethered to nourishing truths.\n\nIt also imbues its lessons with poetry. In a legendary haiku, the great seventeenth-century poet Matsuo Bash\u014d attempts to quieten our egoistic ambition by focusing on a firefly, through which we may grow more attentive to our own finitude:\n\nFalling from\n\nA blade of grass, to fly off \u2013\n\nA firefly.\n\nOn its slender wings, the firefly is an ideal carrier of Zen reminders of the need for dignified resignation in the face of the mightiness and destructiveness of the natural order. Kobayashi Issa, an eighteenth-century Buddhist priest as well as a haiku master, wrote 230 poems on fireflies. In one of the most celebrated, he captures a moment in high summer when time is momentarily stilled as the insects put on their show:\n\nThe fireflies are sparkling\n\nAnd even the mouth of a frog\n\nHangs wide open\n\nIt is a tiny moment of satori or enlightenment. The frog is as wonderstruck as the poet at the movements of the brave, doomed fireflies\u2014much as we should fairly be amazed, grateful, and ultimately joyous to have been allocated a few brief moments in which to dance and give off a burst of light against the darkness of an always largely impenetrable universe that is already 13.8 billion years old.\n\n10 The Emperor\u2019s Giraffe\n\nWe may be sad because we think we know it all, because everything has grown stale and familiar\u2014because we have, for very understandable reasons, lost the ability to wonder.\n\nYet the world is always stranger and more unexpected than we can bring ourselves to believe in our depressed moods. Zhu Di, the Yongle Emperor, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty (r. 1402\u201324), had by middle age grown tired of his role as royal intermediary between heaven and earth. He had a thousand mistresses, he\u2019d conquered Vietnam and tamed the Mongols, and he\u2019d commissioned the largest book ever written, the Yongle Encyclopedia, which explained every element in the history of Chinese civilization. But, weary in his soul, the Emperor made a move that none of his predecessors had ever attempted. He sent some ships to explore the wider world. Chinese rulers knew their country to be the most interesting and blessed on the planet and therefore generally felt no need to go elsewhere\u2014beyond at most subduing a near neighbor. Yet Zhu Di asked his explorer and mariner, the eunuch Admiral Zheng He, to venture out and make a thorough survey of all the barbarian lands he could find. With a more or less unlimited budget, Zheng He had a vast fleet built in the Longjiang shipyard near Nanjing and, after a banquet presided over by the Emperor at which sacrifices were made to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors, China\u2019s largest-ever expeditionary force set off. It dropped in on Brunei, Java, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India before crossing to Arabia and Africa, stopping at Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi.\n\nAlong the way, the admiral picked up a panoply of gifts and treasures that he hoped would amuse and delight the Emperor: manuscripts, sculptures, clothes, gold, palm and date trees, figs, all manner of spices, a few slaves, and many new concubines. But what Zhu Di really loved was animals and the admiral picked up a veritable zoo-full that had never been seen before in China: lions, leopards, dromedary camels, ostriches, zebras, a rhino, and antelopes.\n\nOne animal in particular took the Emperor\u2019s fancy: a giraffe that his admiral had bought from a couple of intrepid Kenyan traders in eastern India. Laying eyes on it for the first time, he stroked the animal\u2019s hide, marveled at its long neck and graceful but slightly awkward way of walking\u2014and gave it his blessing. His spirits having lifted, Zhu Di invited the entire court to take a look. He had an enclosure especially built for the giraffe in his palace and often took walks with it around the grounds. Unsurprisingly, he asked his favorite artist to capture his new friend, an honor he did not bestow on any other foreign animal.\n\nWe probably all had some of Emperor Zhu Di\u2019s excitement when we first laid eyes on a giraffe, at the age of three. We too would have marveled at that long neck and admired the bright patterning and strange gait. But somewhere along the line, we stopped wondering\u2014about giraffes and pretty much everything else as well. The world became familiar and then stale.\n\nWe should not, perhaps, have given up so easily. Giraffes remain hugely odd and importantly wonderful. We do not live on a dull planet, but we have allowed our sorrows to drain our capacity for joy. We should, when depression weighs us down, strive to remind ourselves that the world remains full of giraffes and what they symbolize: renewed charm and creativity, new opportunities for interest, and fresh reasons to keep going.\n\nUnknown artist (formerly attributed to Shen Du), Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, 16th century.\n\n11 An End to Suffering\n\nHinduism is both salutary and original in proposing that there is nothing especially noble or interesting about being alive. Once we look at matters dispassionately, a lot of what we have to go through is misery and suffering: we need\u2014with great effort\u2014to grow up, to assume responsibilities, to master a profession, to have a family, to take our place in societies full of backbiting and hypocrisy, to watch those we love get ill, and eventually to succumb to old age ourselves. To think highly of life is, through a Hindu lens, a fundamental intellectual error.\n\nAs Hinduism sees it, our real purpose is to be done with life for ever. That is the true summit of existence. Hinduism reverses the Western equation: The sinful and blinkered are forced to live for ever, while the righteous and awakened are privileged enough to be able to die. If we are not careful, if we do not show sufficient mercy and imagination toward others, we may well\u2014Hinduism suggests\u2014be subjected to the ultimate punishment: We will have to carry on into eternity.\n\nThe symbol of this ghastly ongoingness is the eight-spoked wheel of samsara, the most commonly depicted element in the religion, which evokes the pitiless and unceasing nature of life\u2014to which we are committed unless we take a disciplined series of averting actions that together comprise the central components of Hindu ethics.\n\nHinduism does not suggest that we will carry on for ever in our own bodies. According to the process of samsara, we are reborn into a succession of different outward envelopes, each of which is eroded away and disintegrated by time. Because samsara is at work across the whole animal kingdom, we might find that our enduring atman or soul transmigrates at our death into the body of a woodlouse, a pelican, or a house spider, though we might also be reborn as a paediatric nurse or a president. What determines the quality of the migration is the degree of karma or virtue that we have accrued in our lives. Among the many reasons we might have to be kind to others is an awareness that unkindness might leave us having to suffer a cycle or two of life as a cockroach or a naked mole rat.\n\nAlong the way, Hinduism generates an uncommon degree of respect and tenderness for all living things. When we look at a wasp or a crab, we aren\u2019t contemplating creatures fundamentally different from ourselves; a few turns of the wheel of life ago their atman might have been located in a High Court judge or a dental hygienist. We might as a result\u2014as most Hindus do\u2014feel it appropriate to stick to a vegetarian diet, lest we unwittingly eat our old uncle or geography teacher.\n\nThe suspicion that life is constantly painful and anxious is one that we largely have to bear in a very lonely way in the philosophies of the West. In those of the East, however, pessimism is ennobled and takes center stage. We are permitted to feel weary and amply dissatisfied. We have, without quite knowing it, been alive since the start of creation, and it is untenably exhausting and frustrating. The trick, and the true prize, will be to be good and wise enough to learn to die once and for all.\n\nFor Hindus, the way to step off the treadmill of eternal existence relies, first and foremost, on a piece of intellectual insight. We cease to be subject to samsara and are delivered into the comforting repose of nothingness known as brahman once we realize that, despite many appearances to the contrary, however paradoxical or absurd the idea might sound, we and the universe are in truth one.\n\nAn eight-spoked wheel decorating the Hindu Konark Sun Temple in India, 13th century.\n\nFrom the earliest age, we tend to assume the very opposite. It seems self-evident that we are one kind of thing and the tree over there, the relative over here, the clouds in the sky, the monkey on the parapet, and the river wending its way to the sea belong to quite different categories. Yet Hinduism insists that our belief in difference belongs ultimately to a realm of maya or illusion. If we look more deeply into the nature of things, through the help of teaching and spiritual exercises, we stand to discover the remarkable unity of all elements. Contrary to appearances, everything we see and experience around us belongs to the same life force: the leaves unfurling on the tree, the child learning to read, the earthworm digging its tunnels, the lava bubbling from the earth \u2013 all belong to a single unitary power which only egoistic prejudice has hitherto prevented us from acknowledging as one.\n\nMost of our pain, Hinduism argues, arises from an overeager attachment to the differences between ourselves and the rest of the world. We pay inordinate attention to who has slightly more money or respect than we do. We are constantly humiliated by people and events that don\u2019t seem to honor our sense of uniqueness.\n\nBut through a process known as moksha or liberation, we can throw off the veil of illusion that works to separate us from the universe and start to identify with cosmic totality. It no longer matters exactly where we end and others begin; everything belongs to the same whole that we have mistakenly and unnecessarily carved up into parts. There is a little less reason to grasp, to be puffed up, to be proud, or to become embittered. We can survey the course of our lives and of our societies with calm indifference. We can cease to identify happiness with the working out of our will upon the world and instead take in with compassion and serenity whatever destiny throws our way. We will then enjoy paripurna-brahmanubhava, the experience of oneness with brahman, the principle of all things.\n\nOnce we have let go of our ego like this, we may have a few more years left to live, but we can be sure that\u2014eventually\u2014we will not need to keep returning. Constant rebirth is the fate of those who cleave too tightly to their own selves. By contrast, those who have learned to surrender can at their demise merge with the universe and will never need to suffer the indignities of individual life again.\n\n12 The Deckchairs of the Titanic\n\nThere remain few expressions better able to capture the futility of a task than one which compares our efforts to \u201crearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.\u201d The hull has been breached and the ship is sinking, so to concern ourselves with the position of the loungers would be the ultimate folly, the deepest possible failure to recognize the true hopelessness of the situation.\n\nThe point seems grimly apt because we are, many of us, a little like the passengers on a stricken liner. Our larger hopes in life have been fatally holed: We see now that our careers won\u2019t ever particularly flourish; our relationships will always be compromised; we\u2019ve passed our peak in terms of looks; our bodies are going to fall prey to ever more humiliating illnesses; society isn\u2019t going to cure itself; significant political progress looks deeply improbable. Our ship is going down. It can feel as if trying to improve our condition, let alone find pleasure and distraction, would be an insult to the facts. Our instinct is to be as funereal and gloomy as our ultimate end.\n\nBut there\u2019s one crucial element that distinguishes our predicament from that of the passengers who lost their lives on the RMS Titanic in the early hours of April 15, 1912: time. They had little more than two hours between feeling the ominous shudder of the impact and the moment when the once-majestic vessel broke apart and sank into the North Atlantic. We\u2019re going down too, but far, far more slowly. It\u2019s as if the captain had let it be known that the hull had been breached, there were not enough lifeboats, and there was zero chance of ever reaching port, but then added that it would probably be many decades before we finally slipped beneath the waves.\n\nSo though we can\u2019t be saved, though the end will be grim, we still have options as to how to use our remaining time. We are involved in a catastrophe, but there are better and worse ways of filling the days. In those circumstances, expending thought and effort on \u201crearranging the deckchairs\u201d is no longer ridiculous at all; it\u2019s an eminently logical step. There could be no higher calling.\n\nFrancis Browne, Titanic \u2019s port side A-Deck promenade, April 11, 1912.\n\nWhen our large hopes for ourselves become unattainable, we have to become inventive around lesser, but still real, options for the time that remains. Keeping cheerful and engaged in spite of everything becomes a major task. If we were on a very gradually sinking luxury liner in the early twentieth century, we might every evening strive to put on a dinner jacket and go to dance the foxtrot to the music of the string quintet, sing a cheerful song, or settle into the second-class library on C Deck as, all the while, bits of seaweed and debris lapped at our ankles. Or we might look out for the best spot for our collapsible recliner so that we could watch the seabirds wheeling in the sky or seek some privacy for a long, soul-exploring conversation with a new friend to the sound of crockery smashing somewhere in a galley down below. We might try our first game of quoits on the slightly tilting deck or drop in contrary to our habits up to this time\u2014on a wild party in steerage. Of course, from a wider perspective our lives would remain a thorough disaster, but we might find we were starting to enjoy ourselves.\n\nSuch inventiveness is precisely what we need to learn how to develop in order to cope with our doomed state. How can we invest the coming period with meaning even though everything is, overall, entirely dark? It\u2019s a question our culture hasn\u2019t prepared us for. We\u2019ve been taught to focus on our big hopes, on how we can aim for everything going right. We crave a loving marriage, deeply satisfying and richly rewarding work, a stellar reputation, an ideally fit body, and positive social change. We\u2019ve not been prepared\u2014as yet\u2014to ask ourselves what remains when many of these are no longer options: when love will always be tricky, politics compromised, or the crowd hostile. What are the viable ways of seeking the best spot for a deckchair on a listing liner?\n\nIf marriage is far less blissful than we\u2019d imagined, perhaps we can turn to friendship. If society won\u2019t accord us the dignity we deserve, perhaps we can find a group of fellow outcasts. If our careers have irretrievably faltered, perhaps we can turn to new interests. If political progress turns out to be perennially blocked and the news is always sour, we might absorb ourselves in nature.\n\nWe are turning to what our society might dismiss as Plan Bs: what people do when they can\u2019t do the things they really want to do. But there\u2019s a surprising catch\u2014or, really, the opposite of a catch. It may turn out that the secondary, lesser, lighter reasons for living are in fact more substantial than we\u2019d imagined. And once we get to know them, we might come to think that they are what we should have been focusing on all along. It has taken a seeming disaster to get us to realize how central they should always have been.\n\n13 Calvary Cemetery\n\nIn the city behind the cemetery are some of the most driven, clever, productive, ruthless, and cynical people ever to have been gathered into a single space in the history of humankind. On the island of Manhattan, we don\u2019t exist aside from the money and fame we accrue. There is no friendship or pity. Everyone is longing to see everyone else disgraced. People are proud of their cynicism. We need to triumph rapidly\u2014or leave town.\n\nIt\u2019s to defend ourselves against the fear and panic induced by this terrifying piece of real estate that we should take a subway out to Calvary Cemetery in Queens: 365 acres tightly packed with the bodies of military heroes, Wall Street Titans, Fifth Avenue princesses, and the ordinary heart attack and cancer victims of the northeastern United States. It might sound sad to spend a few hours communing with the dead in this way but it may, in these parts, be a great deal more reviving than attempting to connect with the living. Amid the graves, there is at least room for sympathy; there is space for thoughtfulness and tenderness. No one mentions an IPO.\n\nWhatever their wealth, everyone slips into a similar-sized coffin. The most famous and awe-inspiring are reliably forgotten within two generations and each corpse however large its last tax return\u2014is quickly gnawed at by similar armies of undiscriminating worms. Death is beautifully democratic: To microbial life, the Upper East Side tastes much the same as the Bronx. The former leave exclusive penthouses on Park Avenue feet first in the morning and by evening are interred for eternity in a plot no larger than one of their former bathtubs. Everyone is silent, there is no more gossip, the journalists have gone, and the invitations dried up.\n\nThe largest cities of modernity excel in their powers to shatter our sincerity and peace of mind. It becomes impossible not to worry that we have been excluded and not to have nightmares about our downfall. We know that we should leave time for introspection, creativity, and vulnerable conversation, but we are too scared to remember how to begin. We forget all that is gentle and touching and that we understood so well when we were five. We cannot turn away from a mass media which appals us with news of never-ending threats to our reputations and livelihoods or those of others. We fear we can never be loved outside of what we can boast about at dinner.\n\nThe cemetery cares nothing for all of this. It bids us to sit on a bench and commune for a while with its stable and heartfelt verities. It asks us to live in such a way that we do not dishonor ourselves from the perspective of death. We should worry only about those things that still seem serious when contemplated from the far side of the grave. We should measure our thoughts against the implied verdicts of a skeleton.\n\nWe can be grateful to the dead of Queens for trying to save us from the living of Manhattan.\n\nPaige Lipsky, Calvary Cemetery, Queens, with Manhattan Skyline, 2017.\n\n14 Meteor Crater\n\nDay to day, the evidence for the idea is so slight, and the entire concept so peculiar and contrary to our sense of things, it\u2019s no wonder that we push it to the back of our minds and have resisted giving it its due place in public consciousness. And yet the evidence is incontrovertible: Much of who we are and of how life on the planet has taken hold is to be explained by the arrival of asteroids and comets.\n\nIn the Earth\u2019s early days 4.5 billion years ago, things were entirely dry, lifeless, and inert until, around 3.8 billion years ago, the planet underwent what is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of up to 200 million years in which giant planets were knocked off their normal circuits and objects scattered into the path of the terrestrial planets. Some 100,000 asteroids and comets of all different sizes smashed into the atmosphere-less Earth and on board these extraterrestrial objects came the central ingredients for life: the water in the oceans, the calcium in our teeth, the potassium in our brains, the carbon in our hair, the glycine in our cells, and the ribose in our DNA.\n\nThe evidence has since then been well concealed. We can see the pockmarked surface of the moon or Mars well enough through our telescopes, but here on Earth the mantle of life has cleverly disguised the story of its origins. Most of the craters have been filled in by vegetation, water, or erosion. There remain only a hundred or so pristine impact sites to be seen anywhere on the planet.\n\nFor a long time, the locals in Winslow, Arizona, refused to accept that this is what the place could be. They took it to be a volcano; many just called it a mountain. But one local meteoriticist, Harvey Nininger, insisted on the extraterrestrial theory, toured the area picking up small fragments of the alleged meteorite, wrote a book called A Comet Strikes the Earth, and set up the American Meteorite Museum a few miles from the crater\u2019s rim. Settled scientific opinion now agrees: The big hole in the ground exists because 50,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, a nickel-iron meteorite fifty meters wide slammed into Arizona at 12.8 kilometers a second and released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT.\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s one of the most photogenic of all craters and so we might choose to pin it to the refrigerator door and turn to it whenever we feel any temptation toward self-righteousness or grandiosity. If one was founding a new religion dedicated to wisdom and maturity, Winslow might have a good claim to be considered the new Jerusalem.\n\nAerial view of Meteor (Barringer) Crater, Arizona.\n\n15 San Juan River\n\nOne of our greatest difficulties\u2014it gives us problems in so many areas is that we can\u2019t understand time. However often the facts are explained to us, they keep slipping from our minds. Our myopia is partly rooted in our lifespan: The eighty or so years we have on the planet tend to power a steadfast background sense of what a \u201clong time\u201d might mean. Our brains dwell predominantly on the here and now, for there seems no efficiency or reward in having too many thoughts about what used to be or what is to come. Three months from now already feels very remote; a decade before our birth has a primeval sheen to it; five years away is unimaginable.\n\nThese biases are understandable but they make things far harder than they need to be. We continually exaggerate both the importance of setbacks in our individual lives and, more broadly, the significance of these lives within the greater span of planetary existence. And as a result we panic far more than we should and we laugh far less than we might. Anyone who thinks of a five-hour journey as \u201clong\u201d or a three-minute download time as \u201cslow\u201d is going to have problems finding perspective around a great many travails.\n\nThe sharp bends in the San Juan river in southeastern Utah appear to know our problem well enough and offer us a powerful solution to it. We cannot spend more than a moment in their company without sensing that we are being told something very powerful about time and, more specifically, how much of it there has been\u2014and how little of that has been about us, or government ministers, or shocking headlines, or mesmerizing scandals. The San Juan river has very slowly cut a winding 300-meter-deep canyon through 300 million years of time. The rocks at the bottom date back to the Palaeozoic period, some 60 million years before the dinosaurs. The Earth\u2019s continents were at that point fused together into the giant landmass of Pangea, the apex predator was the Dimetrodon, the land was populated by synapsids and diapsids, and the seas were filled with mollusks, echinoderms, brachiopods, and ammonoids. The air buzzed with dragonflies the size of eagles.\n\nSan Juan river, Utah, 2010.\n\nWe forget most of what we\u2019ve ever been taught about time, but it pays to keep a few basic facts in mind:\n\nthe Earth was formed 4.543 billion years ago\n\nlife on Earth started 3.77 billion years ago\n\nthe first land animal dates back 428 million years\n\nthe first dinosaurs date back 243 million years\n\nthe first Homo sapiens date back 200,000 years\n\nagriculture started 10,000 years ago\n\nthe early dynastic period in Egypt began 3,000 years ago\n\nthe Roman Empire was at its height 1,920 years ago\n\nthe first photograph was taken 196 years ago\n\nthe first powered flight took place 120 years ago\n\nmy last moment of despair was 5 days ago\n\nEven as we scan the list, our attention may blur: a few million here or there is a hard concept to fix in the mind. The San Juan river appreciates the difficulty and won\u2019t set us any tests. It is content\u2014through its majestic beauty\u2014to make an overall point that should reach us through our senses as much as it does through our understanding. It really only wants to say one very simple thing to us non-experts in its ancient gravelly voice: that it is very, very old and that we are very, very short-lived. And on that basis alone, we should probably surrender our absurd and painful sense of the seriousness and importance of all that we are and do.\n\n16 Arco di Riccardo\n\nThe Roman gateway now known as the Arco di Riccardo\u2014the Riccardo in question may or may not be Richard the Lionheart\u2014was erected in the city of Tergeste (modern Trieste) at some point during the first century ad.\n\nIt formed part of an extensive program of works for the city which included new walls, baths, and a library. The architect would have been well known and newcomers would have been awed. But as the centuries passed the Romans lost their empire. The statues that had once adorned the area were vandalized. The city was annexed by one warlord after another. The surroundings decayed and anyone who could do moved away. People chiseled out lumps of stone from the arch to repair their own homes. In winter ice expanded in the cracks, gradually weakening the entire fabric.\n\nA tenement building was erected beside the arch, casually making use of one of its piers as part of the side wall and destroying its once-noble symmetry. Today, the arch juts straight out of a restaurant famed locally for its orecchiette with fresh tuna and its swordfish with aubergine pur\u00e9e.\n\nFor those who knew the arch when it was built, it might be confounding to see it battered, mutilated, and half buried. But we can take pride in its survival as well. The past may be substantially submerged but bits of it live on; things don\u2019t disappear entirely. We can make our peace with what remains, integrating its irregular masonry into our present. We can live promiscuously among the debris of different ages. An old gateway might magnanimously offer to hold up a beam of a family restaurant where, after much thought, we may order the maccheroncini with red shrimp.\n\nArco di Riccardo, Trieste, Italy, 2017.\n\nSurprising us in the middle of a street with its ancientness, the arch offers to release us from the intimidating aspects of our own times. Everything that seems impressive or important today will gradually lose its prestige. Our urgent debates will be known only to a few scholars who will struggle to find an audience. Our current celebrities will seem like the most old-fashioned people in the world and then will be forgotten entirely. Our most radical ideas will sound incomprehensible and everything that motivates or disturbs us will be forgotten. Our personal errors will count for nothing in the sweep of history. No one will remember or care about our failings. The things that loom so large and are so painful and agitating in our own picture of our lives will leave almost no trace.\n\nTo the Romans who built the arch, it would have seemed that the fall of their world was the fall of the entire world. They could not begin to imagine that the planet would ultimately survive well enough without them and that new and, in significant ways, much better forms of society would eventually emerge.\n\nAt some point in the future, someone will look on a decayed fragment of New York, Tokyo, or London and wonder for a moment about what we who lived then were like\u2014and all their ideas will be wrong and we will be free.\n\n17 The Fennec Fox\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of an animal better adapted to the strange and difficult place it has to live than the fennec fox. In its native Saharan and Sinai deserts, the fennec has to cope with daytime temperatures of 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), a near-complete lack of water, boiling sand, sparse food supplies, and predatory vultures and jackals. Yet for each of its many challenges, it has arrived at an ingenious solution: its vast ears, up to fifteen centimeters long, help dissipate heat and detect the slightest movement of lizards and geckos; it can allow its body temperature to rise to 40.9\u00b0C (105.6\u00b0F) before it begins to sweat; it pants at a record-breaking 690 breaths a minute; it has specially adapted kidneys that produce hyperosmotic urine; and its fur covers its feet to give them traction and stop them burning as it runs across the hot sand.\n\nTo look at a fennec is to see evidence of 8 million years of evolution in relation to the rigors of one very specific habitat. We humans don\u2019t need to be jealous. We too were entirely well adapted to our original habitats: We acquired intensely fearful reactions that would alert us to predators, lusts that would help us find fertile mates, appetites for sugar that would help us maintain body weight, and minds favoring snap judgments to evade snakes and sabretooth tigers. We also had perfect spines for being on our feet all day.\n\nBut there is a major difference between us and the fennec. We no longer live in the environments to which we were originally adapted. Backs evolved to walk for kilometers in the savannah now slouch on office chairs; eyes honed to detect wild berries now focus in on another slice of polenta cake.\n\nThere have, it is true, been a few changes in our DNA over the last 60,000 years. Humans living in the Arctic have evolved to carry thicker layers of fat on their faces to reduce the risk of frostbite. Rice-and wheat-cultivating populations have gained an ability to better digest starch thanks to the salivary enzyme amylase. Around 6,000 years ago, a mutation in the OCA2 gene tweaked levels of melanin in northern populations and gave some of them blue eyes.\n\nBut no animal on earth whose original habitat has altered as radically as ours has survived while evolving as little as we have. We are doing well enough, but we should be forgiving when aspects of our historically evolved constitutions interact awkwardly with distinctive features of modernity. We are, at points, like a fennec forced to live in Hampshire, an African elephant trying to make its way in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, or a tropical rock lobster making a go of it in the waters off Antarctica.\n\nGenetic evolution moves a lot less quickly than human history, making relics of much about our minds and bodies. It should be no wonder that we often eat too much, watch porn all day, develop backache, tremble at the thought of sharks, and get statistics entirely wrong. Narrowly speaking, it isn\u2019t our fault. It\u2019s just that a lot of who we are and what we want made a lot more sense in a world that no longer exists.\n\nFennec fox (Vulpes zerda).\n\n18 The Happy Few\n\nOne of the leading ambitions of modern society has been to make as many of life\u2019s pleasures and opportunities open to as many people as possible. \u201cAccessible\u201d has become one of our greatest terms of praise, democracy is our highest political ideal, and inclusivity can feel like our most urgent social aspiration. We retain, by contrast, nothing but contempt and anger for concepts like exclusive, aristocratic, and elite.\n\nBut because there is always value in studying what is outlying and contrary, we can in the modern context usefully turn to the example of the French novelist, diarist, and travel writer Marie-Henri Beyle (1783\u20131842), more commonly known by his pen name Stendhal, author of two of the greatest novels of French literature, Le Rouge et le Noir and La Chartreuse de Parme. Born into a prosperous middle-class family in Grenoble, as a young man Stendhal worked for the Napoleonic regime in a number of minor diplomatic and military roles. But after Bonaparte\u2019s exile, he grew disenchanted with his native country, which he came to associate with illiberalism, prudishness, anger, and cynicism. He knew plenty of people but had few real friends. In company, he had difficulty articulating his thoughtful, sweet, impish nature\u2014the waspish critic Lytton Strachey once described him as someone who combined the penetrating intelligence of a High Court judge with the soft heart and weepy nature of an eleven-year-old girl.\n\nStendhal was no political reactionary. He wanted the vote to be open to all and for the talented to progress whatever their backgrounds. Nevertheless he became increasingly drawn to the idea of an \u201caristocracy\u201d\u2014that is, the existence of a distinguished elite who could be favored above others. This had nothing whatsoever to do with an aristocracy of the blood. What Stendhal cared about was an aristocracy of the heart: an elite who knew how to feel, think, long for, connect, and be quiet and sad in ways that few seemed to favor. He came to the view that though modern democratic society proclaimed the equality of all peoples and stridently sought to place everyone on the same footing, the sad reality was that only a narrow group would ever really understand matters in the profound, generous, witty, and kind way that he did.\n\nStendhal left France for Italy. He moved from Florence to Naples to Rome, eventually serving as the French consul in Trieste and Civitavecchia. It was in Italy that he began to use a phrase with which we still associate him. He remarked, in letters and in books, that he was going to dedicate his work and his life not to the masses, not to society in general, but to \u201cthe happy few.\u201d The phrase comes from Shakespeare\u2014a line in Henry V : \u201cwe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d but Stendhal gave it his own meaning. He understood by it a minority of people, all of them his imaginary friends, who had the kind of sensibility he revered though it was very much out of step with modern times: people who were hugely emotionally sensitive, thoughtful, loved to be on their own a lot, adored art and culture, hated political hysteria and vindictiveness, were sexually generous and open, and loved the sort of peaceful, unambitious, aesthetically sensitive life that he had discovered in Italy. People would know they had stumbled upon one of \u201cthe happy few\u201d when they saw someone who had often known unrequited love, was full of regrets about their career but couldn\u2019t abide the fierce tactics needed to succeed at it, was moved by Mozart and Correggio, liked to laugh warmly at the tragedies of existence\u2014and might swoon and well up with tears at a building like the Baptistery of St John in the center of Florence, the beauty of which contrasts so sharply with the chaos and ugliness of the world at large, and which had especially touched Stendhal by its graceful symmetry.\n\nThe Baptistery, Florence, Italy, c. 1890\u20131900.\n\nWe often feel wretched for thinking, in our hearts, that we don\u2019t like many people, that most of those we meet are disappointing, and that we don\u2019t hold out much hope for the future of our species. It isn\u2019t fun to be misanthropic in a modern, upbeat, excited democracy. But we can in dejected moods turn to Stendhal as our own imaginary friend who will never punish us for our reservations. We may not even be misanthropes at all; we may just secretly, without having known it ourselves, have all along belonged to that narrow aristocracy of the heart: the happy few. Cynics are only idealists with awkwardly high standards. No wonder we have been so lonely\u2014and how hopeful to think that we might no longer always have to be so.\n\n19 Astronomy and Melancholy\n\nIt is a mark of the melancholy mind to be unable to side neatly with dominant ideas of what is supposed to count. We know well enough what we\u2019re meant to care about: our careers, the gossip around us, the opinions of the community, the latest stories in the news, our identities in the eyes of others, where the human race is headed in the next decade. We know the purported significance, but we may also, in a private part of our mind, feel at odds with our collective struggles and excitements, peering at them as though through dense glass, distanced from the passions held so dear by those around us. Without anything urgent or despairing being meant by this, we may not feel immensely bothered whether we live or die.\n\nIn such moods, we may be advised to shake ourselves from our torpor and rejoin the clamor, the ecstasy, and the panic. But another move might be to try to honor, and then deepen, the origins of our intuitions. We\u2019re not merely cold or unfeeling. It\u2019s just that we have ended up prone to seeing our species and our planet from a less human-centric perspective. Our eyes naturally settle not on what is directly in front of us but on how we might appear from 6 billion kilometers away. We\u2019re thinking not of what tomorrow will bring but of how the present moment might seem in relation to the age of the Earth.\n\nThe natural place to take such feelings of disengagement is not\u2014as society sometimes tells\u2014us a psychotherapist\u2019s chair, but rather our planetariums and our departments of astronomy, our charts of the lunar surface and our galleries of images from the Voyager space probes. We may redeem our disconsolate intuitions with the help of the swirls of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 236,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers from the sun, or photographs of late afternoon on the Aeolis Palus plain of Mars. Astronomy is the true friend of the melancholy mind, NASA and ESA its presiding deities.\n\nThrough our immersion in space, our alienated perspectives can be confirmed and returned to us with dignity. We are allowed to anchor our disengagement with the human drama to the sides of passing meteorites or the moons of Jupiter. Our loneliness can find a true home on the vast, silent dune fields of Sputnik Planitia in the southern hemisphere of Pluto. Some of our sense of loss can be absorbed by the asteroid-pockmarked surface of the moon. Our insignificance can be framed within the context of the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the observable universe.\n\nIt can seem that planetariums are trying to show us the stars in order to equip us with the knowledge required one day to become astronauts or physicists. But in truth they offer us a means with which to diminish ourselves in our own eyes. They are a tool with which to take the sting out of our nagging sense of unimportance, our frustration at our modest achievements and our feelings of isolation.\n\nThere can be good reasons for us to strive to live in the here and now. But there may be yet more powerful reasons to dwell at least part of the day in the Proterozoic period, 2.5 billion years ago, when single-celled eukaryotes developed deep in the silence of giant undisturbed oceans. We don\u2019t need to blame ourselves unduly if we feel at odds with our nagging fellow humans when we can establish imaginary companionship with some of the many wondrous forms in which life has manifested itself across planetary history, such as the beguiling Psittacosaurus parrot lizard, which lived over 100 million years ago, or its near contemporary, the dog-sized, tuft-tailed, two-legged Chaoyangsaurus.\n\nThe best consolation for our sadness at how little ever works out is to cheer ourselves with the thought that the average stable lifespan of a star is only 8 billion years and that our sun has already burned for just under half of that. Soon enough, this middle-aged star\u2019s increased brightness will cause our oceans to evaporate. It will then run out of hydrogen and become a giant red star, expanding as far as Mars and absorbing the whole of our planet, including the atoms of everyone and everything that is annoying us so much today.\n\nWe should drown our tears in the ocean of suffering to which every living thing is subject. We should align our feelings of purposelessness with detailed news of the five mass extinctions to have already befallen the planet. To every reversal, we should simply answer that there are 40 billion planetary systems at large in our galaxy. Before every anxiety-inducing date or speech, we should mutter to ourselves, like a talismanic prayer, that the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across and that the most distant known galaxy is GN-z11, 32 billion light years from the restaurant or conference center.\n\nThe melancholy mind often suspects that everything may be a bit meaningless. Through astronomy, we can discover, in the most engaging and inadvertently life-affirming way possible, why and how it truly is exactly that.\n\nNASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft captured this image of Pluto on July 14, 2015.\n\n20 Winter\n\nEvery year, nature quietly takes us through a moral lesson that has much to teach us about how we might relate to certain of the more dispiriting and despair-inducing moments in our own development. Beginning in mid-October in the northern hemisphere, the temperature drops, the nights draw in, the earth turns cold and hard, fog lies low over the land, and rain drives hard across the austere, comatose gray-brown landscape. There is nothing immediate we can hope for. We now have nothing to do but wait, with resigned patience, until something better shows up.\n\nFar more than we generally accept, our minds too have cycles. We cannot be permanently fruitful or creative, excited or open. There are necessary times of retrenchment when, whatever we might desire, there seems no alternative but to stop. We can no longer be productive. We lose direction and inspiration. We are immovably numb and sterile.\n\nIt can be easy to panic. Why should such a paralyzed and detached mood have descended on our formerly lively minds? Where have all our ideas and hopes gone? What has happened to our previous animation and gladness?\n\nWe should at such times take reassurance from the late November landscape. Certainly things are lifeless, cold, and in suspension. But this is not the end of the story. Earth is like this not as a destination but as a phase. The deadness is a prelude to new life; the fallow period is a guarantor of fecund days to come. All living organisms need to recharge themselves: old leaves have to give way, tired limbs must rest. The dance and ferment could not go on. It may look as if nothing at all is happening, as though this is a trance without purpose. Yet, deep underground, at this very moment, nutrients are being gathered, the groundwork for future ebullience and dynamism is being laid down, another summer is very slowly collecting its strength.\n\nAs nature seeks to tell us, we cannot permanently be in flower. We need moments of repose and confusion. There is nothing to fear. Things will re-emerge. We should make our peace with our own midwinters and lean on nature\u2019s wise accommodation to strengthen us in our pursuit of serenity and patience.\n\nAlfred Sisley, Winter Landscape, Moret, c. 1888.\n\n21 Not the End\n\nWhen Spain\u2019s greatest painter completed this drawing he was about eighty and had only two years left to live. He was almost totally deaf, his eyesight was failing, and he couldn\u2019t walk unaided. But he had not given up. He was still making great art, traveling, being read to, deepening his friendships, and, most of all, looking. Despite everything, as he wrote with heartbreaking defiance at the top of the page: Aun aprendo\u2014I\u2019m still learning.\n\nFrancisco de Goya, Aun aprendo (I\u2019m Still Learning), c. 1826.\n\nWhat was he still learning? Not so much about art; he knew most of what there was to know in that field. He was learning the large, central, ostensibly simple but always elusive lessons that life insists on: about forgiveness, the importance of courage, the need to appreciate the beauty of the world, saying yes again and again to the universe despite the horrors, making time for small children, the beauty of lemons and olives, and the tenderness of dusk.\n\nSuch lessons are never complicated in themselves once we mention them. It\u2019s the remembering and the feeling that are hard. Great art strives to convince us in our bones of things that are, intellectually, very basic: love today, don\u2019t lose yourself to grudges, don\u2019t feel singled out by sadness, let joy overwhelm you, don\u2019t be afraid, resist bitterness, care less about what other people think.\n\nThe aged, hobbit-like Goya advancing toward us on his sticks has a twinkle in his eye. He is indomitable. He has come out of bed, even though cautious voices told him not to, because he wants another look at the world. There\u2019s a park he wants to visit, a bookstore he\u2019s heard about, a friend he wants to see. Death may be calling but he won\u2019t listen. He is ancient, he can\u2019t walk straight, he winces in pain but he retains the curiosity and energy of his very young self.\n\nWe have wasted a lot of time. We have refused to learn so much and on so many occasions. We have been flighty, stubborn, blinkered, dull, and hard-hearted. But our spirit isn\u2019t vanquished\u2014which is why we\u2019re here. There are so many pictures left to see and ideas to recall and rehearse.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too late for him\u2014and it isn\u2019t too late for us.",

But the reality is that for many of us the illness will threaten to return for visits throughout our lives; it is a condition to which we will be permanently susceptible. So the challenge isn\u2019t to learn to survive only a one-off crisis but to set in place a framework that can help us manage our fragility over the long term. Some of the following moves, practical and psychological, suggest themselves.",

We should be aware of the special price we have to pay when we allow ourselves to declare the battle over, when we announce to ourselves and to friends that we are well again\u2014and then recognize that we have actually been hasty and naive and need to return to the front once more. It can feel especially bitter to have to crouch low again when we felt we now had the right to stand tall. But it\u2019s better to adopt a stance of ongoing, permanent readiness than submit to cycles of hope followed by panic. We fell ill over many years\u2014our whole childhood might have been the incubating laboratory\u2014and it should not surprise us if we are never totally impervious again.",

We may know that we are prone to self-sabotage, that we carry a trauma with us from the past, that we are inclined to destroy everything that is good about our lives and alienate those who want to care for us. But such knowledge will always be vulnerable to destructive impulses that can sweep away our patient intellectual labor and catapult us back into a state of helpless and frightened infancy. We should be ready to be submerged by negativity and not experience our retreat as a humiliation, confident that ebbs and flows are normal and that we will be able to hold on to at least some of our gains.",

It will help immensely if they have struggles of their own and if we can therefore meet as equal fellow ailing humans, as opposed to hierarchically separated doctors and patients. We\u2019ll need ruthlessness in expunging certain other people from our diaries: people who harbor secret resentments against us, who are latently hostile to self-examination, who are scared of their own minds and project their fears on to us. A few hours with such types can throw a shadow over a whole day, as their unsympathetic voices become lodged in our minds and feed our own ample stores of self-doubt.

We should fight the tendency and, precisely when we cannot bear to admit what we are going through, we should dare to take someone into our confidence. Silence is the primordial enemy. We have to fight a permanent feeling that we are too despicable to be looked after. We have to take a gamble on an always implausible idea: that we deserve kindness.\n\nLOVE\n\nLove is ultimately what will get us through\u2014not romantic love but sympathy, tolerance, and patience. We\u2019ll need to watch our tendencies to turn down love from an innate sense of unworthiness. We wouldn\u2019t have become ill if it were entirely easy for us to accept the positive attention of others. We\u2019ll have to thank those who are offering it, make them feel appreciated in return and, most of all, accept that from the outset our illness was rooted in a deficit of love and therefore that every encounter with love will strengthen our recovery and help keep the darkness at bay.\n\nPILLS\n\nIdeally, we would of course prefer not to keep adding foreign chemicals to our minds.

      "content": "## SMALL AND BIG WINS\n\nMany of the steps we take toward recovery could appear relatively small: a week in which we have not denigrated ourselves, a relationship in which we are allowing ourselves to enjoy kindness, a sequence of peaceful evenings . . . The temptation might be to brush off these achievements a bit too lightly for our own good. Given what we may have gone through, these are milestones that deserve celebration and commemoration, so that we can notice how far we have come and gain strength from a glance back at the peaks and troughs of our mental lives.\n\nWe can think in this context of the work of the English walking artist Hamish Fulton. Fulton has spent his long career turning out large black-and-white photographs of places in the world where he has gone walking. Some of these walks have been epic in scale\u2014whole weeks spent trekking across the Himalayas and the Andes; others have been more domestic\u2014a few hours in the Welsh mountains. But Fulton always accompanies his images with solemn text, a written record of where he has been, how many miles he went, and how long it took him. He arrests a moment that might ordinarily be lost and lends it weight and dignity. Through immaculate lettering and sober photography, he is signaling to us how much a walk may\u2014when fairly be viewed\u2014be life-changing and as worthy of commemoration as a battle or a premiership.\n\nHamish Fulton, Walking to Benicadell, Spain, 2016.\n\nHamish Fulton, A Five Day Circular Clockwise Walk Round London, 2011.\n\nWe could imagine performing a similar exercise of commemoration on the business of recovering from mental illness. Here, too, there are plenty of moments that are quietly extremely arduous and important\u2014and that would warrant being frozen and highlighted. We could picture a vast photograph of an ordinary bathtub to which a caption might say: \u201cMay 12, evening, two hours of soaking, rethinking my relationship to what other people think.\u201d Or a picture of an armchair by a window: \u201cSeptember 3, an hour reflecting on my right to be free and content.\u201d A shot of an unmade bed at night might say: \u201cAn evening of self-forgiveness.\u201d\n\nWe should be proud of ourselves for making it this far. It might at times have looked as if we would never make it. There might have been nights when we sincerely thought of taking our own lives. Somehow we held on. We reached out for help, we dared to tell someone else of our problems, we engaged our minds, we tried to piece together our histories and to plot a more endurable future\u2014and we started reading about what might be up with our minds. We are still here, mentally ill at times, no doubt, but more than ever committed to recovery, appreciative of the light, grateful for love, hungry for insight, and keen to help anyone else whose plight we can recognize. We are not fully well, but we are on the mend and that, for now, is very much good enough.\n\nWithout all those awful things that happened, all those fears, all those people who didn\u2019t understand, what would we have learned? What would we have ever understood? The journey was almost worth it. What looked like a pure waste of time was in fact our own personal education.",
