            The Essay Search Engine project is already set up and running:

            - All Node.js dependencies are installed
            - Dev server is running at http://localhost:5173
            - This is a semantic search engine for personal essay collections
            - The app loads AI models and embeddings to perform semantic search

            You can use the Playwright MCP tools to:
            - Navigate to the app: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
            - Take snapshots: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
            - Click elements: mcp__playwright__browser_click
            - Fill forms: mcp__playwright__browser_fill_form
            - Take screenshots: mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot

            The app requires initialization (click "Initialize Search Engine" button) before searching.
            It will download a 327MB AI model on first use, which may take time in CI.

            When testing, verify:
            - Page loads correctly
            - Initialize button works
            - Search functionality works after initialization
            - Results display properly
